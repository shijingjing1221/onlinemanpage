<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_nfsserver - Manages an NFS server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nfsserver [start | stop | monitor | meta-data |
validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Nfsserver helps to manage the Linux nfs
server as a failover-able resource in Linux-HA. It depends
on Linux specific NFS implementation details, so is
considered not portable to other platforms yet.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS nfs_init_script The default init
script shipped with the Linux distro. The nfsserver resource
agent offloads the start/stop/monitor work to the init
script because the procedure to start/stop/monitor nfsserver
varies on different Linux distro. (optional, string, default
/etc/init.d/nfsserver)</p>

<p>nfs_notify_cmd The tool to send out NSM reboot
notification. Failover of nfsserver can be considered as
rebooting to different machines. The nfsserver resource
agent use this command to notify all clients about the
happening of failover. (optional, string, default
/sbin/sm-notify)</p>

<p>nfs_shared_infodir The nfsserver resource agent will
save nfs related information in this specific directory. And
this directory must be able to fail-over before nfsserver
itself. (required, string, no default)</p>

<p>nfs_ip The floating IP address used to access the nfs
service (required, string, no default)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
40.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 20s. Suggested interval: 10.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 30.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
nfsserver resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive example_nfsserver ocf:heartbeat:nfsserver
params nfs_shared_infodir=string nfs_ip=string op monitor
depth=&quot;0&quot; timeout=&quot;20s&quot;
interval=&quot;10&quot;</p>
