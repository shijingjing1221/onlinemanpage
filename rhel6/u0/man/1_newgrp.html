<p>NEWGRP(1) User Commands NEWGRP(1)</p>

<p>NAME newgrp - log in to a new group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS newgrp [-] [group]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The newgrp command is used to change the
current group ID during a login session. If the optional -
flag is given, the user&acute;s environment will be
reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise
the current environment, including current working
directory, remains unchanged.</p>

<p>newgrp changes the current real group ID to the named
group, or to the default group listed in /etc/passwd if no
group name is given. newgrp also tries to add the group to
the user groupset. If not root, the user will be prompted
for a password if she does not have a password (in
/etc/shadow if this user has an entry in the shadowed
password file, or in /etc/passwd otherwise) and the group
does, or if the user is not listed as a member and the group
has a password. The user will be denied access if the group
password is empty and the user is not listed as a
member.</p>

<p>If there is an entry for this group in /etc/gshadow,
then the list of members and the password of this group will
be taken from this file, otherwise, the entry in /etc/group
is considered.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (boolean) Enable &quot;syslog&quot;
logging of sg activity.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>
