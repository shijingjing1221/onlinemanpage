<p>Tk_InitConsoleChannels(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_InitConsoleChannels(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_InitConsoleChannels - Install the console
channels as standard chan- nels</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_InitConsoleChannels(interp)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
the console chan- nels are created.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_InitConsoleChannels is invoked to create
a set of console channels and install them as the standard
channels. All I/O on these channels will be discarded until
Tk_CreateConsoleWindow is called to attach the console to a
text widget.</p>

<p>This function is for use by shell applications based on
Tk, like wish, on platforms which have no standard channels
in graphical mode, like Win32.</p>

<p>The interp argument is the interpreter in which to
create and install the console channels.</p>

<p>NOTE: If this function is used it has to be called
before the first call to Tcl_RegisterChannel, directly, or
indirectly through other channel functions. Because
otherwise the standard channels will be already initialized
to the system defaults, which will be nonsensical for the
case Tk_InitConsoleChannels is for.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO console(n)</p>

<p>KEYWORDS standard channels, console</p>
