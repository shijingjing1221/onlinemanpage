SIL_DEV_CONFIG(9)</p>

<p>NAME sil_dev_config - Apply device/host-specific errata
fixups</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void sil_dev_config(struct ata_device *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev Device to be examined</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION After the IDENTIFY [PACKET] DEVICE step is
complete, and a device is known to be present, this function
is called. We apply two errata fixups which are specific to
Silicon Image, a Seagate and a Maxtor fixup.</p>

<p>For certain Seagate devices, we must limit the maximum
sectors to under 8K.</p>

<p>For certain Maxtor devices, we must not program the
drive beyond udma5.</p>

<p>Both fixups are unfairly pessimistic. As soon as I get
more information on these errata, I will create a more
exhaustive list, and apply the fixups to only the specific
devices/hosts/firmwares that need it.</p>

<p>20040111 - Seagate drives affected by the Mod15Write bug
are blacklisted The Maxtor quirk is in the blacklist, but
I&acute;m keeping the original pessimistic fix for the
following reasons... - There seems to be less info on it,
only one device gleaned off the Windows driver, maybe only
one is affected. More info would be greatly appreciated. -
But then again UDMA5 is hardly anything to complain
about</p>
