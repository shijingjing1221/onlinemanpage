<p>READ(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual READ(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME read - read a line from standard input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS read [-r] var...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The read utility shall read a single line
from standard input.</p>

<p>By default, unless the -r option is specified, backslash
) shall act as an escape character, as described in Escape
Character (Back- slash) . If standard input is a terminal
device and the invoking shell is interactive, read shall
prompt for a continuation line when:</p>

<p>* The shell reads an input line ending with a backslash,
unless the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>* A here-document is not terminated after a
&lt;newline&gt; is entered.</p>

<p>The line shall be split into fields as in the shell (see
Field Split- ting ); the first field shall be assigned to
the first variable var, the second field to the second
variable var, and so on. If there are fewer var operands
specified than there are fields, the leftover fields and
their intervening separators shall be assigned to the last
var. If there are fewer fields than vars, the remaining vars
shall be set to empty strings.</p>

<p>The setting of variables specified by the var operands
shall affect the current shell execution environment; see
Shell Execution Environment . If it is called in a subshell
or separate utility execution environ- ment, such as one of
the following:</p>

<p>(read foo) nohup read ... find . -exec read ...;</p>

<p>it shall not affect the shell variables in the callers
environment.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The read utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option is supported:</p>

<p>-r Do not treat a backslash character in any special
way. Consider each backslash to be part of the input
line.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>var The name of an existing or nonexisting shell
variable.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be a text file.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of read:</p>

<p>IFS Determine the internal field separators used to
delimit fields; see Shell Variables .</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PS2 Provide the prompt string that an interactive shell
shall write to standard error when a line ending with a
backslash is read and the -r option was not specified, or if
a here-document is not terminated after a &lt;newline&gt; is
entered.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
messages and prompts for continued input.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 End-of-file was detected or an error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -r option is included to enable
read to subsume the purpose of the line utility, which is
not included in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The results are undefined if an end-of-file is detected
following a backslash at the end of a line when -r is not
specified.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command:</p>

<p>while read -r xx yy do printf &quot;%s %n&quot;
&quot;$yy&quot; &quot;$xx&quot; done &lt; input_file</p>

<p>prints a file with the first field of each line moved to
the end of the line.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The read utility historically has been a shell
built-in. It was sepa- rated off into its own utility to
take advantage of the richer descrip- tion of functionality
introduced by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Since read affects the current shell execution
environment, it is gen- erally provided as a shell regular
built-in. If it is called in a sub- shell or separate
utility execution environment, such as one of the
following:</p>

<p>(read foo) nohup read ... find . -exec read ...;</p>

<p>it does not affect the shell variables in the
environment of the caller.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
