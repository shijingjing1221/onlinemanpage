<p>CONFSTR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CONFSTR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME confstr - get configurable variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t confstr(int name, char *buf, size_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The confstr() function shall return
configuration-defined string val- ues. Its use and purpose
are similar to sysconf(), but it is used where string values
rather than numeric values are returned.</p>

<p>The name argument represents the system variable to be
queried. The implementation shall support the following name
values, defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. It may support
others:</p>

<p>If len is not 0, and if name has a configuration-defined
value, conf- str() shall copy that value into the len-byte
buffer pointed to by buf. If the string to be returned is
longer than len bytes, including the terminating null, then
confstr() shall truncate the string to len-1 bytes and
null-terminate the result. The application can detect that
the string was truncated by comparing the value returned by
confstr() with len.</p>

<p>If len is 0 and buf is a null pointer, then confstr()
shall still return the integer value as defined below, but
shall not return a string. If len is 0 but buf is not a null
pointer, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the implementation supports the POSIX shell option,
the string stored in buf after a call to:</p>

<p>confstr(_CS_PATH, buf, sizeof(buf))</p>

<p>can be used as a value of the PATH environment variable
that accesses all of the standard utilities of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, if the return value is less than or equal to
sizeof( buf).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If name has a configuration-defined value,
confstr() shall return the size of buffer that would be
needed to hold the entire configuration- defined value
including the terminating null. If this return value is
greater than len, the string returned in buf is
truncated.</p>

<p>If name is invalid, confstr() shall return 0 and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If name does not have a configuration-defined value,
confstr() shall return 0 and leave errno unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS The confstr() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the name argument is invalid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE An application can distinguish between
an invalid name parameter value and one that corresponds to
a configurable variable that has no config- uration-defined
value by checking if errno is modified. This mirrors the
behavior of sysconf().</p>

<p>The original need for this function was to provide a way
of finding the configuration-defined default value for the
environment variable PATH. Since PATH can be modified by the
user to include directories that could contain utilities
replacing the standard utilities in the Shell and Utilities
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, applications need a way to
determine the system-supplied PATH environment variable
value that contains the correct search path for the standard
utilities.</p>

<p>An application could use:</p>

<p>confstr(name, (char *)NULL, (size_t)0)</p>

<p>to find out how big a buffer is needed for the string
value; use mal- loc() to allocate a buffer to hold the
string; and call confstr() again to get the string.
Alternately, it could allocate a fixed, static buffer that
is big enough to hold most answers (perhaps 512 or 1024
bytes), but then use malloc() to allocate a larger buffer if
it finds that this is too small.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Application developers can normally determine
any configuration vari- able by means of reading from the
stream opened by a call to:</p>

<p>popen(&quot;command -p getconf variable&quot;,
&quot;r&quot;);</p>

<p>The confstr() function with a name argument of _CS_PATH
returns a string that can be used as a PATH environment
variable setting that will reference the standard shell and
utilities as described in the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The confstr() function copies the returned string into a
buffer sup- plied by the application instead of returning a
pointer to a string. This allows a cleaner function in some
implementations (such as those with lightweight threads) and
resolves questions about when the appli- cation must copy
the string returned.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
