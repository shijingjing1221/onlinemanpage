<p>NAME gnutls_compression_set_priority - Sets the priority
on the compression algorithms supported by gnutls.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_compression_set_priority(gnutls_session_t
session, const int * list);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>const int * list is a 0 terminated list of
gnutls_compression_method_t ele- ments.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sets the priority on the compression
algorithms supported by gnutls. Priority is higher for
elements specified before others. After speci- fying the
algorithms you want, you must append a 0. Note that the pri-
ority is set on the client. The server does not use the
algorithms priority except for disabling algorithms that
were not specified.</p>

<p>TLS 1.0 does not define any compression algorithms
except NULL. Other compression algorithms are to be
considered as gnutls extensions.</p>

<p>RETURNS GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error
code.</p>
