<p>NAME ccache-swig - a fast compiler cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ccache-swig [OPTION]</p>

<p>ccache-swig &lt;compiler&gt; [COMPILER OPTIONS]</p>

<p>&lt;compiler&gt; [COMPILER OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ccache-swig is a compiler cache. It speeds
up re-compilation of C/C++/SWIG code by caching previous
compiles and detecting when the same compile is being done
again. ccache-swig is ccache plus support for SWIG. ccache
and ccache-swig are used interchangeably in this docu-
ment.</p>

<p>OPTIONS SUMMARY Here is a summary of the options to
ccache-swig.</p>

<p>-s show statistics summary -z zero statistics -c run a
cache cleanup -C clear the cache completely -F &lt;n&gt; set
maximum files in cache -M &lt;n&gt; set maximum size of
cache (use G, M or K) -h this help page -V print version
number</p>

<p>OPTIONS These options only apply when you invoke ccache
as &quot;ccache-swig&quot;. When invoked as a compiler none
of these options apply. In that case your normal compiler
options apply and you should refer to your compilers
documentation.</p>

<p>-h Print a options summary page</p>

<p>-s Print the current statistics summary for the cache.
The statis- tics are stored spread across the subdirectories
of the cache. Using &quot;ccache-swig -s&quot; adds up the
statistics across all subdi- rectories and prints the
totals.</p>

<p>-z Zero the cache statistics.</p>

<p>-V Print the ccache version number</p>

<p>-c Clean the cache and re-calculate the cache file count
and size totals. Normally the -c option should not be
necessary as ccache keeps the cache below the specified
limits at runtime and keeps statistics up to date on each
compile. This option is mostly useful if you manually modify
the cache contents or believe that the cache size statistics
may be inaccurate.</p>

<p>-C Clear the entire cache, removing all cached
files.</p>

<p>-F &lt;maxfiles&gt; This sets the maximum number of
files allowed in the cache. The value is stored inside the
cache directory and applies to all future compiles. Due to
the way the value is stored the actual value used is always
rounded down to the nearest multiple of 16.</p>

<p>-M &lt;maxsize&gt; This sets the maximum cache size. You
can specify a value in gigabytes, megabytes or kilobytes by
appending a G, M or K to the value. The default is
gigabytes. The actual value stored is rounded down to the
nearest multiple of 16 kilobytes.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION There are two ways to use ccache. You can
either prefix your compile commands with
&quot;ccache-swig&quot; or you can create a symbolic link
between ccache-swig and the names of your compilers. The
first method is most convenient if you just want to try out
ccache or wish to use it for some specific projects. The
second method is most useful for when you wish to use ccache
for all your compiles.</p>

<p>To install for usage by the first method just copy
ccache-swig to some- where in your path.</p>

<p>To install for the second method do something like
this:</p>

<p>cp ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/ ln -s
/usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/gcc ln -s
/usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/g++ ln -s
/usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/cc ln -s
/usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/swig</p>

<p>This will work as long as /usr/local/bin comes before
the path to gcc (which is usually in /usr/bin). After
installing you may wish to run &quot;which gcc&quot; to make
sure that the correct link is being used.</p>

<p>Note! Do not use a hard link, use a symbolic link. A
hardlink will cause &quot;interesting&quot; problems.</p>

<p>EXTRA OPTIONS When run as a compiler front end ccache
usually just takes the same command line options as the
compiler you are using. The only exception to this is the
option --ccache-skip. That option can be used to tell ccache
that the next option is definitely not a input filename, and
should be passed along to the compiler as-is.</p>

<p>The reason this can be important is that ccache does
need to parse the command line and determine what is an
input filename and what is a com- piler option, as it needs
the input filename to determine the name of the resulting
object file (among other things). The heuristic ccache uses
in this parse is that any string on the command line that
exists as a file is treated as an input file name (usually a
C file). By using --ccache-skip you can force an option to
not be treated as an input file name and instead be passed
along to the compiler as a command line option.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ccache uses a number of
environment variables to control operation. In most cases
you wont need any of these as the defaults will be fine.</p>

<p>CCACHE_DIR the CCACHE_DIR environment variable specifies
where ccache will keep its cached compiler output. The
default is &quot;$HOME/.ccache&quot;.</p>

<p>CCACHE_TEMPDIR the CCACHE_TEMPDIR environment variable
specifies where ccache will put temporary files. The default
is the same as CCACHE_DIR. Note that the CCACHE_TEMPDIR path
must be on the same filesystem as the CCACHE_DIR path, so
that renames of files between the two directories can
work.</p>

<p>CCACHE_LOGFILE If you set the CCACHE_LOGFILE environment
variable then ccache will write some log information on
cache hits and misses in that file. This is useful for
tracking down problems.</p>

<p>CCACHE_VERBOSE If you set the CCACHE_VERBOSE environment
variable then ccache will display on stdout all the compiler
invocations that it makes. This can useful for debugging
unexpected problems.</p>

<p>CCACHE_PATH You can optionally set CCACHE_PATH to a
colon separated path where ccache will look for the real
compilers. If you dont do this then ccache will look for the
first executable matching the compiler name in the normal
PATH that isnt a symbolic link to ccache itself.</p>

<p>CCACHE_CC You can optionally set CCACHE_CC to force the
name of the com- piler to use. If you dont do this then
ccache works it out from the command line.</p>

<p>CCACHE_PREFIX This option adds a prefix to the command
line that ccache runs when invoking the compiler. Also see
the section below on using ccache with distcc.</p>

<p>CCACHE_DISABLE If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_DISABLE then ccache will just call the real compiler,
bypassing the cache com- pletely.</p>

<p>CCACHE_READONLY the CCACHE_READONLY environment variable
tells ccache to attempt to use existing cached object files,
but not to try to add any- thing new to the cache. If you
are using this because your CCACHE_DIR is read-only, then
you may find that you also need to set CCACHE_TEMPDIR as
otherwise ccache will fail to create the temporary
files.</p>

<p>CCACHE_CPP2 If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_CPP2 then ccache will not use the optimisation of
avoiding the 2nd call to the pre- processor by compiling the
pre-processed output that was used for finding the hash in
the case of a cache miss. This is pri- marily a debugging
option, although it is possible that some unusual compilers
will have problems with the intermediate file- name
extensions used in this optimisation, in which case this
option could allow ccache to be used.</p>

<p>CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS then there is no compression used on files
that go into the cache. However, this setting has no effect
on how files are retrieved from the cache, compressed
results will still be usable.</p>

<p>CCACHE_NOSTATS If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_NOSTATS then ccache will not update the statistics
files on each compile.</p>

<p>CCACHE_NLEVELS The environment variable CCACHE_NLEVELS
allows you to choose the number of levels of hash in the
cache directory. The default is 2. The minimum is 1 and the
maximum is 8.</p>

<p>CCACHE_HARDLINK If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_HARDLINK then ccache will attempt to use hard links
from the cache directory when creating the compiler output
rather than using a file copy. Using hard links is faster,
but can confuse programs like make that rely on modification
times. Hard links are never made for compressed cache
files.</p>

<p>CCACHE_RECACHE This forces ccache to not use any cached
results, even if it finds them. New results are still
cached, but existing cache entries are ignored.</p>

<p>CCACHE_UMASK This sets the umask for ccache and all
child processes (such as the compiler). This is mostly
useful when you wish to share your cache with other users.
Note that this also affects the file permissions set on the
object files created from your compila- tions.</p>

<p>CCACHE_HASHDIR This tells ccache to hash the current
working directory when calculating the hash that is used to
distinguish two compiles. This prevents a problem with the
storage of the current working directory in the debug info
of a object file, which can lead ccache to give a cached
object file that has the working direc- tory in the debug
info set incorrectly. This option is off by default as the
incorrect setting of this debug info rarely causes problems.
If you strike problems with gdb not using the correct
directory then enable this option.</p>

<p>CCACHE_UNIFY If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_UNIFY then ccache will use the C/C++ unifier when
hashing the pre-processor output if -g is not used in the
compile. The unifier is slower than a normal hash, so
setting this environment variable loses a little bit of
speed, but it means that ccache can take advantage of not
recompiling when the changes to the source code consist of
reformatting only. Note that using CCACHE_UNIFY changes the
hash, so cached compiles with CCACHE_UNIFY set cannot be
used when CCACHE_UNIFY is not set and vice versa. The reason
the uni- fier is off by default is that it can give
incorrect line number information in compiler warning
messages.</p>

<p>CCACHE_EXTENSION Normally ccache tries to automatically
determine the extension to use for intermediate C
pre-processor files based on the type of file being
compiled. Unfortunately this sometimes doesnt work, for
example when using the aCC compiler on HP-UX. On sys- tems
like this you can use the CCACHE_EXTENSION option to over-
ride the default. On HP-UX set this environment variable to
&quot;i&quot; if you use the aCC compiler.</p>

<p>CCACHE_STRIPC If you set the environment variable
CCACHE_STRIPC then ccache will strip the -c option when
invoking the preprocessor. This option is primarily for the
Sun Workshop C++ compiler as without this option an
unwarranted warning is displayed: CC: Warning:
&quot;-E&quot; redefines product from &quot;object&quot; to
&quot;source (stdout)&quot; when -E and -c is used
together.</p>

<p>CCACHE_SWIG When using SWIG as the compiler and it does
not have swig in the executable name, then the CCACHE_SWIG
environment variable needs to be set in order for ccache to
work correctly with SWIG. The use of CCACHE_CPP2 is also
recommended for SWIG due to some preprocessor quirks,
however, use of CCACHE_CPP2 can often be skipped -- check
your generated code with and without this option set. Known
problems are using preprocessor directives within %inline
blocks and the use of #pragma SWIG .</p>

<p>CACHE SIZE MANAGEMENT By default ccache has a one
gigabyte limit on the cache size and no maximum number of
files. You can set a different limit using the &quot;ccache
-M&quot; and &quot;ccache -F&quot; options, which set the
size and number of files limits.</p>

<p>When these limits are reached ccache will reduce the
cache to 20% below the numbers you specified in order to
avoid doing the cache clean oper- ation too often.</p>

<p>CACHE COMPRESSION By default on most platforms ccache
will compress all files it puts into the cache using the
zlib compression. While this involves a negli- gible
performance slowdown, it significantly increases the number
of files that fit in the cache. You can turn off compression
setting the CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS environment variable.</p>

<p>HOW IT WORKS The basic idea is to detect when you are
compiling exactly the same code a 2nd time and use the
previously compiled output. You detect that it is the same
code by forming a hash of:</p>

<p>o the pre-processor output from running the compiler
with -E</p>

<p>o the command line options</p>

<p>o the real compilers size and modification time</p>

<p>o any stderr output generated by the compiler</p>

<p>These are hashed using md4 (a strong hash) and a cache
file is formed based on that hash result. When the same
compilation is done a second time ccache is able to supply
the correct compiler output (including all warnings etc)
from the cache.</p>

<p>ccache has been carefully written to always produce
exactly the same compiler output that you would get without
the cache. If you ever dis- cover a case where ccache
changes the output of your compiler then please let me
know.</p>

<p>USING CCACHE WITH DISTCC distcc is a very useful program
for distributing compilation across a range of compiler
servers. It is often useful to combine distcc with ccache,
so that compiles that are done are sped up by distcc, but
that ccache avoids the compile completely where
possible.</p>

<p>To use distcc with ccache I recommend using the
CCACHE_PREFIX option. You just need to set the environment
variable CCACHE_PREFIX to distcc and ccache will prefix the
command line used with the compiler with the command
distcc.</p>

<p>SHARING A CACHE A group of developers can increase the
cache hit rate by sharing a cache directory. The hard links
however cause unwanted side effects, as all links to a
cached file share the file s modification timestamp. This
results in false dependencies to be triggered by
timestamp-based build systems whenever another user links to
an existing file. Typi- cally, users will see that their
libraries and binaries are relinked without reason. To share
a cache without side effects, the following conditions need
to be met:</p>

<p>o Use the same CCACHE_DIR environment variable
setting</p>

<p>o Unset the CCACHE_HARDLINK environment variable</p>

<p>o Make sure everyone sets the CCACHE_UMASK environment
variable to 002, this ensures that cached files are
accessible to everyone in the group.</p>

<p>o Make sure that all users have write permission in the
entire cache directory (and that you trust all users of the
shared cache).</p>

<p>o Make sure that the setgid bit is set on all
directories in the cache. This tells the filesystem to
inherit group ownership for new directories. The command
&quot;chmod g+s find $CCACHE_DIR -type d&quot; might be
useful for this.</p>

<p>o Set CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS for all users, if there are
users with versions of ccache that do not support
compression.</p>

<p>HISTORY ccache was inspired by the compilercache shell
script script written by Erik Thiele and I would like to
thank him for an excellent piece of work. See
http://www.erikyyy.de/compilercache/ for the Eriks scripts.
ccache-swig is a port of the original ccache with support
added for use with SWIG.</p>

<p>I wrote ccache because I wanted to get a bit more speed
out of a com- piler cache and I wanted to remove some of the
limitations of the shell-script version.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES FROM COMPILERCACHE The biggest differences
between Eriks compilercache script and ccache are:</p>

<p>o ccache is written in C, which makes it a bit faster
(calling out to external programs is mostly what slowed down
the scripts).</p>

<p>o ccache can automatically find the real compiler</p>

<p>o ccache keeps statistics on hits/misses</p>

<p>o ccache can do automatic cache management</p>

<p>o ccache can cache compiler output that includes
warnings. In many cases this gives ccache a much higher
cache hit rate.</p>

<p>o ccache can handle a much wider ranger of compiler
options</p>

<p>o ccache avoids a double call to cpp on a cache miss</p>

<p>CREDITS Thanks to the following people for their
contributions to ccache</p>

<p>o Luciano Rocha for the idea of compiling the
pre-processor output to avoid a 2nd cpp pass</p>

<p>o Paul Russell for many suggestions and the debian
packaging</p>
