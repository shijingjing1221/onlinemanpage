<p>NAME python - an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming lan- guage</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS python [ -B ] [ -d ] [ -E ] [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -m
module-name ] [ -O ] [ -O0 ] [ -Q argument ] [ -s ] [ -S ] [
-t ] [ -u ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -W argument ] [ -x ] [ -3 ] [ -?
] [ -c command | script | - ] [ arguments ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Python is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming lan- guage that combines
remarkable power with very clear syntax. For an introduction
to programming in Python you are referred to the Python
Tutorial. The Python Library Reference documents built-in
and standard types, constants, functions and modules.
Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax
and semantics of the core language in (per- haps too) much
detail. (These documents may be located via the INTER- NET
RESOURCES below; they may be installed on your system as
well.)</p>

<p>Pythons basic power can be extended with your own
modules written in C or C++. On most systems such modules
may be dynamically loaded. Python is also adaptable as an
extension language for existing applica- tions. See the
internal documentation for hints.</p>

<p>Documentation for installed Python modules and packages
can be viewed by running the pydoc program.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -B Dont write .py[co] files on
import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITE- BYTECODE.</p>

<p>-c command Specify the command to execute (see next
section). This termi- nates the option list (following
options are passed as arguments to the command).</p>

<p>-d Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only,
depending on compilation options).</p>

<p>-E Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and
PYTHONHOME that modify the behavior of the interpreter.</p>

<p>-h , -? , --help Prints the usage for the interpreter
executable and exits.</p>

<p>-i When a script is passed as first argument or the -c
option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the
script or the command. It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP
file. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a
stack trace when a script raises an exception.</p>

<p>-m module-name Searches sys.path for the named module
and runs the correspond- ing .py file as a script.</p>

<p>-O Turn on basic optimizations. This changes the
filename exten- sion for compiled (bytecode) files from .pyc
to .pyo. Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.</p>

<p>-O0 Discard docstrings in addition to the -O
optimizations.</p>

<p>-Q argument Division control; see PEP 238. The argument
must be one of &quot;old&quot; (the default, int/int and
long/long return an int or long), &quot;new&quot; (new
division semantics, i.e. int/int and long/long returns a
float), &quot;warn&quot; (old division semantics with a
warning for int/int and long/long), or &quot;warnall&quot;
(old division semantics with a warning for all use of the
division operator). For a use of &quot;warnall&quot;, see
the Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.</p>

<p>-s Dont add user site directory to sys.path.</p>

<p>-S Disable the import of the module site and the
site-dependent manipulations of sys.path that it
entails.</p>

<p>-t Issue a warning when a source file mixes tabs and
spaces for indentation in a way that makes it depend on the
worth of a tab expressed in spaces. Issue an error when the
option is given twice.</p>

<p>-u Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally
unbuffered. On systems where it matters, also put stdin,
stdout and stderr in binary mode. Note that there is
internal buffering in xread- lines(), readlines() and
file-object iterators (&quot;for line in sys.stdin&quot;)
which is not influenced by this option. To work around this,
you will want to use &quot;sys.stdin.readline()&quot; inside
a &quot;while 1:&quot; loop.</p>

<p>-v Print a message each time a module is initialized,
showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which
it is loaded. When given twice, print a message for each
file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also
provides information on module cleanup at exit.</p>

<p>-V , --version Prints the Python version number of the
executable and exits.</p>

<p>-W argument Warning control. Python sometimes prints
warning message to sys.stderr. A typical warning message has
the following form: file:line: category: message. By
default, each warning is printed once for each source line
where it occurs. This option controls how often warnings are
printed. Multiple -W options may be given; when a warning
matches more than one option, the action for the last
matching option is performed. Invalid -W options are ignored
(a warning message is printed about invalid options when the
first warning is issued). Warnings can also be controlled
from within a Python program using the warnings mod-
ule.</p>

<p>The simplest form of argument is one of the following
action strings (or a unique abbreviation): ignore to ignore
all warn- ings; default to explicitly request the default
behavior (print- ing each warning once per source line); all
to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate
many messages if a warn- ing is triggered repeatedly for the
same source line, such as inside a loop); module to print
each warning only the first time it occurs in each module;
once to print each warning only the first time it occurs in
the program; or error to raise an excep- tion instead of
printing a warning message.</p>

<p>The full form of argument is
action:message:category:mod- ule:line. Here, action is as
explained above but only applies to messages that match the
remaining fields. Empty fields match all values; trailing
empty fields may be omitted. The message field matches the
start of the warning message printed; this match is
case-insensitive. The category field matches the warning
category. This must be a class name; the match test whether
the actual warning category of the message is a subclass of
the specified warning category. The full class name must be
given. The module field matches the (fully-qualified) module
name; this match is case-sensitive. The line field matches
the line number, where zero matches all line numbers and is
thus equivalent to an omitted line number.</p>

<p>-x Skip the first line of the source. This is intended
for a DOS specific hack only. Warning: the line numbers in
error messages will be off by one!</p>

<p>-3 Warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3
cannot triv- ially fix.</p>

<p>INTERPRETER INTERFACE The interpreter interface
resembles that of the UNIX shell: when called with standard
input connected to a tty device, it prompts for commands and
executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a file
name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and
executes a script from that file; when called with -c
command, it executes the Python statement(s) given as
command. Here command may contain multi- ple statements
separated by newlines. Leading whitespace is signifi- cant
in Python statements! In non-interactive mode, the entire
input is parsed before it is executed.</p>

<p>If available, the script name and additional arguments
thereafter are passed to the script in the Python variable
sys.argv , which is a list of strings (you must first import
sys to be able to access it). If no script name is given,
sys.argv[0] is an empty string; if -c is used, sys.argv[0]
contains the string -c_. Note that options interpreted by
the Python interpreter itself are not placed in
sys.argv.</p>

<p>In interactive mode, the primary prompt is &gt;&gt;&gt;
; the second prompt (which appears when a command is not
complete) is .... The prompts can be changed by assignment
to sys.ps1 or sys.ps2. The interpreter quits when it reads
an EOF at a prompt. When an unhandled exception occurs, a
stack trace is printed and control returns to the primary
prompt; in non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after
printing the stack trace. The interrupt signal raises the
KeyboardInterrupt exception; other UNIX signals are not
caught (except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor
of the IOError exception). Error messages are written to
stderr.</p>

<p>FILES AND DIRECTORIES These are subject to difference
depending on local installation conven- tions; ${prefix} and
${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent and should be
interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same. The
default for both is /usr/local.</p>

<p>${exec_prefix}/bin/python Recommended location of the
interpreter.</p>

<p>${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; Recommended
locations of the directories containing the standard
modules.</p>

<p>${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;
${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt; Recommended
locations of the directories containing the include files
needed for developing Python extensions and embedding the
interpreter.</p>

<p>~/.pythonrc.py User-specific initialization file loaded
by the user module; not used by default or by most
applications.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PYTHONHOME Change the location of
the standard Python libraries. By default, the libraries are
searched in ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;ver- sion&gt; and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;, where ${prefix}
and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent directories,
both defaulting to /usr/local. When $PYTHONHOME is set to a
single directory, its value replaces both ${prefix} and
${exec_prefix}. To specify different values for these, set
$PYTHONHOME to ${pre- fix}:${exec_prefix}.</p>

<p>PYTHONPATH Augments the default search path for module
files. The format is the same as the shell s $PATH: one or
more directory path- names separated by colons. Non-existent
directories are silently ignored. The default search path is
installation dependent, but generally begins with
${prefix}/lib/python&lt;ver- sion&gt; (see PYTHONHOME
above). The default search path is always appended to
$PYTHONPATH. If a script argument is given, the directory
containing the script is inserted in the path in front of
$PYTHONPATH. The search path can be manipulated from within
a Python program as the variable sys.path .</p>

<p>PYTHONSTARTUP If this is the name of a readable file,
the Python commands in that file are executed before the
first prompt is displayed in interactive mode. The file is
executed in the same name space where interactive commands
are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can
be used without qualification in the interactive session.
You can also change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this
file.</p>

<p>PYTHONY2K Set this to a non-empty string to cause the
time module to require dates specified as strings to include
4-digit years, otherwise 2-digit years are converted based
on rules described in the time module documentation.</p>

<p>PYTHONOPTIMIZE If this is set to a non-empty string it
is equivalent to speci- fying the -O option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -O multiple
times.</p>

<p>PYTHONDEBUG If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -d option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -d multiple
times.</p>

<p>PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE If this is set to a non-empty
string it is equivalent to speci- fying the -B option (don t
try to write .py[co] files).</p>

<p>PYTHONINSPECT If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -i option.</p>

<p>PYTHONNOUSERSITE If this is set to a non-empty string it
is equivalent to speci- fying the -s option (Dont add the
user site directory to sys.path).</p>

<p>PYTHONUNBUFFERED If this is set to a non-empty string it
is equivalent to speci- fying the -u option.</p>

<p>PYTHONVERBOSE If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -v option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -v multiple
times.</p>
