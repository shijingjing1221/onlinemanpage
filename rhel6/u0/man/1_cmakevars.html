<p>NAME cmakevars - Reference of CMake variables.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION variables defined by
cmake, that give information about the project, and
cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_AR Name of archiving tool for static
libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies name of the program that creates archive
or static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR The path to the top level of the build
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL Tool used for the acutal build
process.</p>

<p>This variable is set to the program that will be needed
to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was
Visual Stu- dio 6, the CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM will be set to
msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For Nmake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR The directory with the
CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the directory that has the
CMake- Cache.txt file in it. This is the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION Major version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the major version of CMake used to write
a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION Minor version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write
a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_RELEASE_VERSION Release version of CMake
used to create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This is stores the release version of CMake used to
write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a
different version of CMake is run on a previously created
cache file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR Build time configuration directory for
project.</p>

<p>This is a variable that is used to provide developers
access to the intermediate directory used by Visual Studio
IDE projects. For example, if building Debug all executables
and libraries end up in a Debug directory. On UNIX systems
this variable is set to &quot;.&quot;. However, with Visual
Studio this variable is set to $(IntDir). $(IntDir) is
expanded by the IDE only. So this variable should only be
used in custom commands that will be run during the build
process. This variable should not be used directly in a
CMake command. CMake has no way of knowing if Debug or
Release will be picked by the IDE for a build type. If a
program needs to know the directory it was built in, it can
use CMAKE_INTDIR. CMAKE_INTDIR is a C/C++ preprocessor macro
that is defined on the command line of the compiler. If it
has a value, it will be the intermediate directory used to
build the file. This way an executable or a library can find
files that are located in the build directory.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMMAND The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands. (e.g.
/usr/local/bin/cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING Is CMake currently cross
compiling.</p>

<p>This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is
cross compiling. Specifically if the build platform is
different from the target platform.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND Full path to ctest command installed
with cmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR The path to the binary
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the build directory that is
currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by
add_subdirec- tory will create a binary directory in the
build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will
be set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the one currently being
processed. See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE The line number of the current
file being processed.</p>

<p>This is the line number of the file currently being
processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR The path to the source
directory currently being processed.</p>

then the library search path is modified to look for 64 bit
libraries first.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH If true, do not add run time path
information.</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is
not added to compiled executables. The defaultis to add
rpath information if the platform supports it.This allows
for easy running from the build tree.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR The path to the top level of the source

projects.</p>

<p>[Project name]_SOURCE_DIR Top level source directory for
the named project.</p>

<p>A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT
command, and is the source directory for the project. This
can be use- ful when add_subdirectory is used to connect
several projects.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR BUILD_SHARED_LIBS Global
flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if
on.</p>

<p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be
built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a
static library. This variable is often added to projects as
an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they
want to build the project using shared or static
libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY Version of cmake required
to build project</p>

<p>From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this
speci- fies what version of CMake should be supported. By
default this value is the version number of CMake that you
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set
by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Specifies the build type for make based
generators.</p>

<p>This specifies what build type will be built in this
tree. Pos- sible values are empty, Debug, Release,
RelWithDebInfo and Min- SizeRel. This variable is only
supported for make based genera- tors. If this variable is
supported, then CMake will also pro- vide initial values for
the variables with the name
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]. For
example, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE Enables color output when using the
Makefile generator.</p>

<p>When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce
colored out- put. Default is ON.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Specifies the available build
types.</p>

<p>This specifies what build types will be available such
as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms. But can be extended to provide
other build types. See also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES Prefixes to prepend when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what prefixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX
systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Suffixes to append when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what suffixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On
Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning
that when trying to find the foo library it will look for
foo.dll etc.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Install directory used by
install.</p>

<p>If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is
built, this directory is pre-pended onto all install
directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable
or dll.</p>

<p>This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable
MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for static the
static MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This
is used in visual studio 6 and 7 project files. The
CMakeSetup dialog uses MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like
this:</p>

<p>ADD_DEFINITIONS(-D_AFXDLL)</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)</p>

<p>add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH Path to look for cmake modules to
load.</p>

<p>Specifies a path to override the default seach path for
CMake modules. For example include commands will look in
this path first for modules to include.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if
true.</p>

<p>This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake
to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(),
with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYS- TEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See
also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default this contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH for this. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_PRO- GRAM_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE Specify a file that can
change the build rule variables.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, it should to point to a
CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all
the system settings have been set, but before they have been
used. This would allow you to override any variables that
need to be changed for some special project.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM APPLE True if running
on Mac OSX.</p>

<p>Set to true on Mac OSX.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Apple OSX.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is being run
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead
of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is running
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
running on.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 True on windows systems, including
win64.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Windows and on
cygwin.</p>

<p>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX Maximum object file full-path
length allowed by native build tools.</p>

<p>CMake computes for every source file an object file name
that is unique to the source file and deterministic with
respect to the full path to the source file. This allows
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full
paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds
a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that
is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may
have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the
limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than
128.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p>This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAMEand
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>This is the name of the operating system on which CMake
is tar- geting. On systems that have the uname command, this
variable is set to the output of uname -s. Linux, Windows,
and Darwin for Mac OSX are the values found on the big three
operating systems.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
building for.</p>

<p>On systems that support uname, this variable is set to
the out- put of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value
of the envi- ronment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>A numeric version string for the system, on systems that
support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname
-r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version
numbers.</p>

<p>CYGWIN True for cygwin.</p>

<p>Set to true when using CYGWIN.</p>

<p>MSVC True when using Microsoft Visual C</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is some version of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC_IDE True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE</p>

<p>Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft
Visual C IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.</p>

For example 1300 is MSVC 6.0.</p>

<p>UNIX True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the target system is UNIX or UNIX like
(i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).</p>

<p>Set to true when the target system is Windows and on
cygwin.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Default filename postfix for
libraries under configuration &lt;CON- FIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When a non-executable target is created its
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX target property is initialized with
the value of this variable if it is set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
ARCHIVE targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Use the install path for
the RPATH</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with the install path
for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when
installed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX See variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This variable is a special case of the more-general
CMAKE_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags used to create
executables.</p>

<p>Flags used by the linker when creating an
executable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_[CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE] Flag used when
linking an executable.</p>

creating executables.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Fortran module output
directory.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OSX directory name for
installed targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the
INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target
prop- erty for more information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for
all targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker
search and installed rpath.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if
set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and out- side the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is
used to initial- ize the target property
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all tar- gets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
LIBRARY targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

.def file for dll creation.</p>

<p>The flag used to add a .def file when creating a dll on
Windows, this is only defined on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG Flag used to link a library
specified by a path to its file.</p>

<p>The flag used before a library file path is given to the
linker. This is needed only on very few platforms.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG Flag used to link a library into
an executable.</p>

<p>The flag used to specify a library to link to an
executable. On most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
RUNTIME targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
build tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with no RPATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS Use relative paths (May not
work!).</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative
paths between the source and binary tree. This option does
not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths
are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to
move CMake gener- ated makefiles to a different location
regardless of the value of this variable.</p>

<p>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH Old executable location
variable.</p>

<p>The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes
this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets
are oth- erwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH Old library location variable.</p>

<p>The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
supercede this vari- able for a target if they are set.
Library targets are other- wise placed in this
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES FOR LANGUAGES
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND Rule variable to append to
a static archive.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append
to a static archive. It is used in place of

static archive. It is used in place of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE- ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms
in order to support large object counts. See also
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND and
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH Rule variable to
finish an existing static archive.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to finish a
static archive. It is used in place of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE- ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms
in order to support large object counts. See also
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE and
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER The full path to the
compiler for LANG.</p>

<p>This is the command that will be used as the
&lt;LANG&gt; compiler. Once set, you can not change this
variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ABI An internal variable
subject to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_ID An internal variable
subject to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler and is subject
to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILE_OBJECT Rule variable to
compile a single object file.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile
a single object file for for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY Rule variable
to create a shared library.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a
shared library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_MODULE Rule variable to
create a shared module.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a
shared library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY Rule variable
to create a static library.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a
static library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_DEBUG Flags for Debug build
type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
Debug.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL Flags for MinSizeRel
build type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
MinSizeRel.Short for minimum size release.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELEASE Flags for Release build
type or configuration.</p>

Information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS File extensions
that should be ignored by the build.</p>

project for a given language but are not compiled.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on
compiler command lines for language &lt;LANG&gt;. This
prevents system include directories from being treated as
user include directories on some compilers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE Determine if a
language should be used for linking.</p>

<p>If this is &quot;Preferred&quot; then if there is a
mixed language shared library or executable, then this
languages linker command will be used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE Rule variable to link
and executable.</p>

source files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt; True if the compiler
is GNU.</p>

<p>If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU
compiler then this is TRUE, if not it is FALSE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI An internal variable subject
to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt; Specify a
file that can change the build rule variables.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, it should to point to a
CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all
the system settings have been set, but before they have been
used. This would allow you to override any variables that
need to be changed for some language.</p>
