<p>NAME grpck - verify integrity of group files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grpck [-r] [group [ shadow ]]</p>

<p>grpck [-s] [group [ shadow ]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The grpck command verifies the integrity of
the groups information. It checks that all entries in
/etc/group and /etc/gshadow have the proper format and
contain valid data. The user is prompted to delete entries
that are improperly formatted or which have other
uncorrectable errors.</p>

<p>Checks are made to verify that each entry has:</p>

<p>&middot; the correct number of fields</p>

<p>&middot; a unique and valid group name</p>

<p>&middot; a valid group identifier (/etc/group only)</p>

<p>&middot; a valid list of members and administrators</p>

<p>&middot; a corresponding entry in the /etc/gshadow file
(respectively /etc/group for the gshadow checks)</p>

<p>The checks for correct number of fields and unique group
name are fatal. If an entry has the wrong number of fields,
the user will be prompted to delete the entire line. If the
user does not answer affirmatively, all further checks are
bypassed. An entry with a duplicated group name is prompted
for deletion, but the remaining checks will still be made.
All other errors are warnings and the user is encouraged to
run the groupmod command to correct the error.</p>

<p>The commands which operate on the /etc/group and
/etc/gshadow files are not able to alter corrupted or
duplicated entries. grpck should be used in those
circumstances to remove the offending entries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the grpck command
are:</p>

<p>-r Execute the grpck command in read-only mode. This
causes all questions regarding changes to be answered no
without user intervention.</p>

<p>-s Sort entries in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow by
GID.</p>

<p>By default, grpck operates on /etc/groupand
/etc/gshadow. The user may select alternate files with the
group and shadow parameters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The grpck command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>2 one or more bad group entries</p>

<p>3 can&acute;t open group files</p>

<p>4 can&acute;t lock group files</p>

<p>5 can&acute;t update group files</p>

pwck(8), shadow(5).</p>
