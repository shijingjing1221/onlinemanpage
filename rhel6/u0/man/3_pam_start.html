<p>PAM_START(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_START(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_start - initialization of PAM transaction</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_start(const char *service_name, const char
*user, const struct pam_conv *pam_conversation, pam_handle_t
**pamh);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_start function creates the PAM
context and initiates the PAM transaction. It is the first
of the PAM functions that needs to be called by an
application. The transaction state is contained entirely
within the structure identified by this handle, so it is
possible to have multiple transactions in parallel. But it
is not possible to use the same handle for different
transactions, a new one is needed for every new context.</p>

<p>The service_name argument specifies the name of the
service to apply and will be stored as PAM_SERVICE item in
the new context. The policy for the service will be read
from the file /etc/pam.d/service_name or, if that file does
not exist, from /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p>The user argument can specify the name of the target
user and will be stored as PAM_USER item. If the argument is
NULL, the module has to ask for this item if necessary.</p>

<p>The pam_conversation argument points to a struct
pam_conv describing the conversation function to use. An
application must provide this for direct communication
between a loaded module and the application.</p>

<p>Following a successful return (PAM_SUCCESS) the contents
of pamh is a handle that contains the PAM context for
successive calls to the PAM functions. In an error case is
the content of pamh undefined.</p>

<p>The pam_handle_t is a blind structure and the
application should not attempt to probe it directly for
information. Instead the PAM library provides the functions
pam_set_item(3) and pam_get_item(3). The PAM handle cannot
be used for mulitiple authentications at the same time as
long as pam_end was not called on it before.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_ABORT General failure.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Transaction was successful created.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR System error, for example a NULL pointer
was submitted instead of a pointer to data.</p>
