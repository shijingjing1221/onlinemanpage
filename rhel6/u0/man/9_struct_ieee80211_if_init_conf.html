STRUCT IEEE80211_IF_(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_ieee80211_if_init_conf - initial
configuration of an interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct ieee80211_if_init_conf { enum
nl80211_iftype type; struct ieee80211_vif * vif; void *
mac_addr; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS type one of enum nl80211_iftype constants.
Determines the type of added/removed interface.</p>

<p>vif pointer to a driver-use per-interface structure. The
pointer itself is also used for various functions including
ieee80211_beacon_get and ieee80211_get_buffered_bc.</p>

<p>mac_addr pointer to MAC address of the interface. This
pointer is valid until the interface is removed (i.e. it
cannot be used after remove_interface callback was called
for this interface).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This structure is used in add_interface and
remove_interface callbacks of struct ieee80211_hw.</p>

<p>When you allow multiple interfaces to be added to your
PHY, take care that the hardware can actually handle
multiple MAC addresses. However, also take care that when
there&acute;s no interface left with mac_addr != NULL you
remove the MAC address from the device to avoid
acknowledging packets in pure monitor mode.</p>
