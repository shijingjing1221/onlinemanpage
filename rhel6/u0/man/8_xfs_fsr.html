<p>NAME xfs_fsr - filesystem reorganizer for XFS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_fsr [-v] [-t seconds] [-f leftoff] [-m
mtab] xfs_fsr [-v] [xfsdev | file] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_fsr is applicable only to XFS
filesystems.</p>

<p>xfs_fsr improves the organization of mounted
filesystems. The reorga- nization algorithm operates on one
file at a time, compacting or other- wise improving the
layout of the file extents (contiguous blocks of file
data).</p>

<p>The following options are accepted by xfs_fsr. The -m,
-t, and -f options have no meaning if any filesystems or
files are specified on the command line.</p>

<p>-m mtab Use this file for the list of filesystems to
reorganize. The default is to use /etc/mtab.</p>

<p>-t seconds How long to reorganize. The default is 7200
(2 hours).</p>

<p>-f leftoff Use this file instead of /var/tmp/.fsrlast to
read the state of where to start and as the file to store
the state of where reorganization left off.</p>

<p>-v Verbose. Print cryptic information about each file
being reorganized.</p>

<p>When invoked with no arguments xfs_fsr reorganizes all
regular files in all mounted filesystems. xfs_fsr makes many
cycles over /etc/mtab each time making a single pass over
each XFS filesystem. Each pass goes through and selects
files that have the largest number of extents. It attempts
to defragment the top 10% of these files on each pass.</p>

<p>It runs for up to two hours after which it records the
filesystem where it left off, so it can start there the next
time. This information is stored in the file
/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs. If the information found here is
somehow inconsistent or out of date it is ignored and
reorgani- zation starts at the beginning of the first
filesystem found in /etc/mtab.</p>

<p>xfs_fsr can be called with one or more arguments naming
filesystems (block device name), and files to reorganize. In
this mode xfs_fsr does not read or write
/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs nor does it run for a fixed time
interval. It makes one pass through each specified regular
file and all regular files in each specified filesystem. A
command line name referring to a symbolic link (except to a
file system device), FIFO, or UNIX domain socket generates a
warning message, but is otherwise ignored. While traversing
the filesystem these types of files are silently
skipped.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/mtab contains default list of filesystems to
reorga- nize. /var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs records the state where
reorganization left off.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO xfs_fsr(8), mkfs.xfs(8), xfs_ncheck(8),
xfs(5).</p>

<p>NOTES xfs_fsr improves the layout of extents for each
file by copying the entire file to a temporary location and
then interchanging the data extents of the target and
temporary files in an atomic manner. This method requires
that enough free disk space be available to copy any given
file and that the space be less fragmented than the original
file. It also requires the owner of the file to have enough
remaining filespace quota to do the copy on systems running
quotas. xfs_fsr gen- erates a warning message if space is
not sufficient to improve the tar- get file.</p>

<p>A temporary file used in improving a file given on the
command line is created in the same parent directory of the
target file and is prefixed by the string .fsr. The
temporary files used in improving an entire XFS device are
stored in a directory at the root of the target device and
use the same naming scheme. The temporary files are unlinked
upon creation so data will not be readable by any other
process.</p>

<p>xfs_fsr does not operate on files that are currently
mapped in memory. A file busy error can be seen for these
files if the verbose flag (-v) is set.</p>

<p>Files marked as no-defrag will be skipped. The xfs_io(8)
chattr command with the f attribute can be used to set or
clear this flag. Files and directories created in a
directory with the no-defrag flag will inherit the
attribute.</p>

<p>An entry in /etc/mtab or the file specified using the -m
option must have the rw option specified for read and write
access. If this option is not present, then xfs_fsr skips
the filesystem described by that line. See the fstab(5)
reference page for more details.</p>

<p>In general we do not foresee the need to run xfs_fsr on
system parti- tions such as /, /boot and /usr as in general
these will not suffer from fragmentation. There are also
issues with defragmenting files lilo(8) uses to boot your
system. It is recommended that these files should be flagged
as no-defrag with the xfs_io(8) chattr command. Should these
files be moved by xfs_fsr then you must rerun lilo before
you reboot or you may have an unbootable system.</p>
