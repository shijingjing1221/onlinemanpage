<p>GFORTRAN(1) GNU GFORTRAN(1)</p>

<p>NAME gfortran - GNU Fortran compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfortran [-c|-S|-E] [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]
[-Wwarn...] [-pedantic] [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] [-foption...]
[-mmachine-option...] [-o outfile] infile...</p>

<p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below
for the remainder.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gfortran command supports all the
options supported by the gcc command. Only options specific
to GNU Fortran are documented here.</p>

<p>All GCC and GNU Fortran options are accepted both by
gfortran and by gcc (as well as any other drivers built at
the same time, such as g++), since adding GNU Fortran to the
GCC distribution enables acceptance of GNU Fortran options
by all of the relevant drivers.</p>

<p>In some cases, options have positive and negative forms;
the negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. This manual
documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not
the default.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Here is a summary of all the options specific to
GNU Fortran, grouped by type. Explanations are in the
following sections.</p>

<p>Options controlling Fortran dialect The following
options control the details of the Fortran dialect accepted
by the compiler:</p>

<p>-ffree-form -ffixed-form Specify the layout used by the
source file. The free form layout was introduced in Fortran
90. Fixed form was traditionally used in older Fortran
programs. When neither option is specified, the source form
is determined by the file extension.</p>

<p>-fall-intrinsics This option causes all intrinsic
procedures (including the GNU- specific extensions) to be
accepted. This can be useful with -std=f95 to force
standard-compliance but get access to the full range of
intrinsics available with gfortran. As a consequence,
-Wintrinsics-std will be ignored and no user-defined
procedure with the same name as any intrinsic will be called
except when it is explicitly declared
&quot;EXTERNAL&quot;.</p>

<p>-fd-lines-as-code -fd-lines-as-comments Enable special
treatment for lines beginning with &quot;d&quot; or
&quot;D&quot; in fixed form sources. If the
-fd-lines-as-code option is given they are treated as if the
first column contained a blank. If the -fd-lines-as-comments
option is given, they are treated as comment lines.</p>

<p>-fdefault-double-8 Set the &quot;DOUBLE PRECISION&quot;
type to an 8 byte wide type. If -fdefault-real-8 is given,
&quot;DOUBLE PRECISION&quot; would instead be promoted to 16
bytes if possible, and -fdefault-double-8 can be used to
prevent this. The kind of real constants like
&quot;1.d0&quot; will not be changed by -fdefault-real-8
though, so also -fdefault-double-8 does not affect it.</p>

<p>-fdefault-integer-8 Set the default integer and logical
types to an 8 byte wide type. Do nothing if this is already
the default. This option also affects the kind of integer
constants like 42.</p>

<p>-fdefault-real-8 Set the default real type to an 8 byte
wide type. Do nothing if this is already the default. This
option also affects the kind of non-double real constants
like 1.0, and does promote the default width of &quot;DOUBLE
PRECISION&quot; to 16 bytes if possible, unless
&quot;-fdefault-double-8&quot; is given, too.</p>

<p>-fdollar-ok Allow $ as a valid character in a symbol
name.</p>

<p>-fbackslash Change the interpretation of backslashes in
string literals from a single backslash character to
&quot;C-style&quot; escape characters. The &quot;, following
combinations are expanded &quot;&quot;, &quot;,, &quot;0,
&quot; &quot;&quot;, &quot; &quot;\&quot;, and &quot; &quot;
to the ASCII characters alert, backspace, form feed,
newline, carriage return, horizontal tab, vertical tab,
backslash, and NUL, respectively. Additionally, nn,
&quot;&quot;nnnn and &quot;U&quot;nnnnnnnn (where each n is
a hexadecimal digit) are translated into the Unicode
characters corresponding to the specified code points. All
other combinations of a character preceded by are
unexpanded.</p>

<p>-fmodule-private Set the default accessibility of module
entities to &quot;PRIVATE&quot;. Use-associated entities
will not be accessible unless they are explicitly declared
as &quot;PUBLIC&quot;.</p>

<p>-ffixed-line-length-n Set column after which characters
are ignored in typical fixed-form lines in the source file,
and through which spaces are assumed (as if padded to that
length) after the ends of short fixed-form lines.</p>

<p>Popular values for n include 72 (the standard and the
default), 80 (card image), and 132 (corresponding to
&quot;extended-source&quot; options in some popular
compilers). n may also be none, meaning that the entire line
is meaningful and that continued character constants never
have implicit spaces appended to them to fill out the line.
-ffixed-line-length-0 means the same thing as
-ffixed-line-length-none.</p>

<p>-ffree-line-length-n Set column after which characters
are ignored in typical free-form lines in the source file.
The default value is 132. n may be none, meaning that the
entire line is meaningful. -ffree-line-length-0 means the
same thing as -ffree-line-length-none.</p>

<p>-fmax-identifier-length=n Specify the maximum allowed
identifier length. Typical values are 31 (Fortran 95) and 63
(Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008).</p>

<p>-fimplicit-none Specify that no implicit typing is
allowed, unless overridden by explicit &quot;IMPLICIT&quot;
statements. This is the equivalent of adding &quot;implicit
none&quot; to the start of every procedure.</p>

<p>-fcray-pointer Enable the Cray pointer extension, which
provides C-like pointer functionality.</p>

<p>-fopenmp Enable the OpenMP extensions. This includes
OpenMP &quot;!$omp&quot; directives in free form and
&quot;c$omp&quot;, *$omp and &quot;!$omp&quot; directives in
fixed form, &quot;!$&quot; conditional compilation sentinels
in free form and &quot;c$&quot;, &quot;*$&quot; and
&quot;!$&quot; sentinels in fixed form, and when linking
arranges for the OpenMP runtime library to be linked in. The
option -fopenmp implies -frecursive.</p>

<p>-fno-range-check Disable range checking on results of
simplification of constant expressions during compilation.
For example, GNU Fortran will give an error at compile time
when simplifying &quot;a = 1. / 0&quot;. With this option,
no error will be given and &quot;a&quot; will be assigned
the value &quot;+Infinity&quot;. If an expression evaluates
to a value outside of the relevant range of
[&quot;-HUGE()&quot;:&quot;HUGE()&quot;], then the
expression will be replaced by &quot;-Inf&quot; or
&quot;+Inf&quot; as appropriate. Similarly, &quot;DATA
i/Z&rsquo;FFFFFFFF&rsquo;/&quot; will result in an integer
overflow on most systems, but with -fno-range-check the
value will &quot;wrap around&quot; and &quot;i&quot; will be
initialized to -1 instead.</p>

<p>-std=std Specify the standard to which the program is
expected to conform, which may be one of f95, f2003, f2008,
gnu, or legacy. The default value for std is gnu, which
specifies a superset of the Fortran 95 standard that
includes all of the extensions supported by GNU Fortran,
although warnings will be given for obsolete extensions not
recommended for use in new code. The legacy value is
equivalent but without the warnings for obsolete extensions,
and may be useful for old non-standard programs. The f95,
f2003 and f2008 values specify strict conformance to the
Fortran 95, Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 standards,
respectively; errors are given for all extensions beyond the
relevant language standard, and warnings are given for the
Fortran 77 features that are permitted but obsolescent in
later standards.</p>

<p>Enable and customize preprocessing Preprocessor related
options. See section Preprocessing and conditional
compilation for more detailed information on preprocessing
in gfortran.</p>

<p>-cpp -nocpp Enable preprocessing. The preprocessor is
automatically invoked if the file extension is .fpp, .FPP,
.F, .FOR, .FTN, .F90, .F95, .F03 or .F08. Use this option to
manually enable preprocessing of any kind of Fortran
file.</p>

<p>To disable preprocessing of files with any of the above
listed extensions, use the negative form: -nocpp.</p>

<p>The preprocessor is run in traditional mode, be aware
that any restrictions of the file-format, e.g. fixed-form
line width, apply for preprocessed output as well.</p>

<p>-dM Instead of the normal output, generate a list of
&rsquo;#define&rsquo; directives for all the macros defined
during the execution of the preprocessor, including
predefined macros. This gives you a way of finding out what
is predefined in your version of the preprocessor. Assuming
you have no file foo.f90, the command</p>

<p>touch foo.f90; gfortran -cpp -dM foo.f90</p>

<p>will show all the predefined macros.</p>

<p>-dD Like -dM except in two respects: it does not include
the predefined macros, and it outputs both the
&quot;#define&quot; directives and the result of
preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the standard
output file.</p>

<p>-dN Like -dD, but emit only the macro names, not their
expansions.</p>

<p>-dU Like dD except that only macros that are expanded,
or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives,
are output; the output is delayed until the use or test of
the macro; and &rsquo;#undef&rsquo; directives are also
output for macros tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p>-dI Output &rsquo;#include&rsquo; directives in addition
to the result of preprocessing.</p>

<p>-fworking-directory Enable generation of linemarkers in
the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the
current working directory at the time of preprocessing. When
this option is enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after
the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current
working directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this
directory, when its present in the preprocessed input, as
the directory emitted as the current working directory in
some debugging information formats. This option is
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhibited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command line, this option has no effect, since no
&quot;#line&quot; directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p>-idirafter dir Search dir for include files, but do it
after all directories specified with -I and the standard
system directories have been exhausted. dir is treated as a
system include directory. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;,
then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot
prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-imultilib dir Use dir as a subdirectory of the
directory containing target- specific C++ headers.</p>

<p>-iprefix prefix Specify prefix as the prefix for
subsequent -iwithprefix options. If the prefix represents a
directory, you should include the final &rsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p>-isysroot dir This option is like the --sysroot option,
but applies only to header files. See the --sysroot option
for more information.</p>

<p>-iquote dir Search dir only for header files requested
with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not
searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard system
directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-isystem dir Search dir for header files, after all
directories specified by -I but before the standard system
directories. Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets
the same special treatment as is applied to the standard
system directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then
the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p>-nostdinc Do not search the standard system directories
for header files. Only the directories you have specified
with -I options (and the directory of the current file, if
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p>-undef Do not predefine any system-specific or
GCC-specific macros. The standard predefined macros remain
defined.</p>

<p>-Apredicate=answer Make an assertion with the predicate
predicate and answer answer. This form is preferred to the
older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported,
because it does not use shell special characters.</p>

<p>-A-predicate=answer Cancel an assertion with the
predicate predicate and answer answer.</p>

<p>-C Do not discard comments. All comments are passed
through to the output file, except for comments in processed
directives, which are deleted along with the directive.</p>

<p>You should be prepared for side effects when using -C;
it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in
their own right. For example, comments appearing at the
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a &rsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Warning: this currently handles C-Style comments only.
The preprocessor does not yet recognize Fortran-style
comments.</p>

<p>-CC Do not discard comments, including during macro
expansion. This is like -C, except that comments contained
within macros are also passed through to the output file
where the macro is expanded.</p>

<p>In addition to the side-effects of the -C option, the
-CC option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to
be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line. The -CC option is generally
used to support lint comments.</p>

<p>Warning: this currently handles C- and C++-Style
comments only. The preprocessor does not yet recognize
Fortran-style comments.</p>

<p>-Dname Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p>-Dname=definition The contents of definition are
tokenized and processed as if they appeared during
translation phase three in a &rsquo;#define&rsquo;
directive. In particular, the definition will be truncated
by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or
shell-like program you may need to use the shells quoting
syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
command line, write its argument list with surrounding
parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh,
&quot;-D&rsquo;name(args...)=definition&rsquo;&quot;
works.</p>

<p>-D and -U options are processed in the order they are
given on the command line. All -imacros file and -include
file options are processed after all -D and -U options.</p>

<p>-H Print the name of each header file used, in addition
to other normal activities. Each name is indented to show
how deep in the &rsquo;#include&rsquo; stack it is.</p>

<p>-P Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from
the preprocessor. This might be useful when running the
preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be
sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.</p>

<p>-Uname Cancel any previous definition of name, either
built in or provided with a -D option.</p>

<p>Options to request or suppress errors and warnings
Errors are diagnostic messages that report that the GNU
Fortran compiler cannot compile the relevant piece of source
code. The compiler will continue to process the program in
an attempt to report further errors to aid in debugging, but
will not produce any compiled output.</p>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report
constructions which are not inherently erroneous but which
are risky or suggest there is likely to be a bug in the
program. Unless -Werror is specified, they do not prevent
compilation of the program.</p>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options
beginning -W, for example -Wimplicit to request warnings on
implicit declarations. Each of these specific warning
options also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default.</p>

<p>These options control the amount and kinds of errors and
warnings produced by GNU Fortran:</p>

<p>-fmax-errors=n Limits the maximum number of error
messages to n, at which point GNU Fortran bails out rather
than attempting to continue processing the source code. If n
is 0, there is no limit on the number of error messages
produced.</p>

<p>-fsyntax-only Check the code for syntax errors, but dont
actually compile it. This will generate module files for
each module present in the code, but no other output
file.</p>

<p>-pedantic Issue warnings for uses of extensions to
Fortran 95. -pedantic also applies to C-language constructs
where they occur in GNU Fortran source files, such as use
ofe in a character constant within a directive like
&quot;#include&quot;.</p>

<p>Valid Fortran 95 programs should compile properly with
or without this option. However, without this option,
certain GNU extensions and traditional Fortran features are
supported as well. With this option, many of them are
rejected.</p>

<p>Some users try to use -pedantic to check programs for
conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what
they want---it finds some nonstandard practices, but not
all. However, improvements to GNU Fortran in this area are
welcome.</p>

<p>This should be used in conjunction with -std=f95,
-std=f2003 or -std=f2008.</p>

<p>-pedantic-errors Like -pedantic, except that errors are
produced rather than warnings.</p>

<p>-Wall Enables commonly used warning options pertaining
to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we believe are
easy to avoid. This currently includes -Waliasing,
-Wampersand, -Wsurprising, -Wintrinsics-std, -Wno-tabs,
-Wintrinsic-shadow and -Wline-truncation.</p>

<p>-Waliasing Warn about possible aliasing of dummy
arguments. Specifically, it warns if the same actual
argument is associated with a dummy argument with
&quot;INTENT(IN)&quot; and a dummy argument with
&quot;INTENT(OUT)&quot; in a call with an explicit
interface.</p>

<p>The following example will trigger the warning.</p>

<p>interface subroutine bar(a,b) integer, intent(in) :: a
integer, intent(out) :: b end subroutine end interface
integer :: a</p>

<p>call bar(a,a)</p>

<p>-Wampersand Warn about missing ampersand in continued
character constants. The warning is given with -Wampersand,
-pedantic, -std=f95, -std=f2003 and -std=f2008. Note: With
no ampersand given in a continued character constant, GNU
Fortran assumes continuation at the first non-comment,
non-whitespace character after the ampersand that initiated
the continuation.</p>

<p>-Warray-temporaries Warn about array temporaries
generated by the compiler. The information generated by this
warning is sometimes useful in optimization, in order to
avoid such temporaries.</p>

<p>-Wcharacter-truncation Warn when a character assignment
will truncate the assigned string.</p>

<p>-Wline-truncation Warn when a source code line will be
truncated.</p>

<p>-Wconversion Warn about implicit conversions between
different types.</p>

<p>-Wimplicit-interface Warn if a procedure is called
without an explicit interface. Note this only checks that an
explicit interface is present. It does not check that the
declared interfaces are consistent across program units.</p>

<p>-Wintrinsics-std Warn if gfortran finds a procedure
named like an intrinsic not available in the currently
selected standard (with -std) and treats it as
&quot;EXTERNAL&quot; procedure because of this.
-fall-intrinsics can be used to never trigger this behaviour
and always link to the intrinsic regardless of the selected
standard.</p>

<p>-Wsurprising Produce a warning when
&quot;suspicious&quot; code constructs are encountered.
While technically legal these usually indicate that an error
has been made.</p>

<p>This currently produces a warning under the following
circumstances:</p>

<p>&middot; An INTEGER SELECT construct has a CASE that can
never be matched as its lower value is greater than its
upper value.</p>

<p>&middot; A LOGICAL SELECT construct has three CASE
statements.</p>

<p>&middot; A TRANSFER specifies a source that is shorter
than the destination.</p>

<p>&middot; The type of a function result is declared more
than once with the same type. If -pedantic or
standard-conforming mode is enabled, this is an error.</p>

<p>-Wtabs By default, tabs are accepted as whitespace, but
tabs are not members of the Fortran Character Set. For
continuation lines, a tab followed by a digit between 1 and
9 is supported. -Wno-tabs will cause a warning to be issued
if a tab is encountered. Note, -Wno-tabs is active for
-pedantic, -std=f95, -std=f2003, -std=f2008 and -Wall.</p>

<p>-Wunderflow Produce a warning when numerical constant
expressions are encountered, which yield an UNDERFLOW during
compilation.</p>

<p>-Wintrinsic-shadow Warn if a user-defined procedure or
module procedure has the same name as an intrinsic; in this
case, an explicit interface or &quot;EXTERNAL&quot; or
&quot;INTRINSIC&quot; declaration might be needed to get
calls later resolved to the desired intrinsic/procedure.</p>

<p>-Wunused-parameter Contrary to gcc s meaning of
-Wunused-parameter, gfortrans implementation of this option
does not warn about unused dummy arguments, but about unused
&quot;PARAMETER&quot; values. -Wunused-parameter is not
included in -Wall but is implied by -Wall -Wextra.</p>

<p>-Walign-commons By default, gfortran warns about any
occasion of variables being padded for proper alignment
inside a COMMON block. This warning can be turned off via
-Wno-align-commons. See also -falign-commons.</p>

<p>-Werror Turns all warnings into errors.</p>

<p>Some of these have no effect when compiling programs
written in Fortran.</p>

<p>Options for debugging your program or GNU Fortran GNU
Fortran has various special options that are used for
debugging either your program or the GNU Fortran
compiler.</p>

<p>-fdump-parse-tree Output the internal parse tree before
starting code generation. Only really useful for debugging
the GNU Fortran compiler itself.</p>

<p>-ffpe-trap=list Specify a list of IEEE exceptions when a
Floating Point Exception (FPE) should be raised. On most
systems, this will result in a SIGFPE signal being sent and
the program being interrupted, producing a core file useful
for debugging. list is a (possibly empty) comma-separated
list of the following IEEE exceptions: invalid (invalid
floating point operation, such as &quot;SQRT(-1.0)&quot;),
zero (division by zero), overflow (overflow in a floating
point operation), underflow (underflow in a floating point
operation), precision (loss of precision during operation)
and denormal (operation produced a denormal value).</p>

<p>Some of the routines in the Fortran runtime library,
like CPU_TIME, are likely to trigger floating point
exceptions when &quot;ffpe-trap=precision&quot; is used. For
this reason, the use of &quot;ffpe-trap=precision&quot; is
not recommended.</p>

<p>-fbacktrace Specify that, when a runtime error is
encountered or a deadly signal is emitted (segmentation
fault, illegal instruction, bus error or floating-point
exception), the Fortran runtime library should output a
backtrace of the error. This option only has influence for
compilation of the Fortran main program.</p>

<p>-fdump-core Request that a core-dump file is written to
disk when a runtime error is encountered on systems that
support core dumps. This option is only effective for the
compilation of the Fortran main program.</p>

<p>Options for directory search These options affect how
GNU Fortran searches for files specified by the
&quot;INCLUDE&quot; directive and where it searches for
previously compiled modules.</p>

<p>It also affects the search paths used by cpp when used
to preprocess Fortran source.</p>

<p>-Idir These affect interpretation of the
&quot;INCLUDE&quot; directive (as well as of the
&quot;#include&quot; directive of the cpp preprocessor).</p>

<p>Also note that the general behavior of -I and
&quot;INCLUDE&quot; is pretty much the same as of -I with
&quot;#include&quot; in the cpp preprocessor, with regard to
looking for header.gcc files and other such things.</p>

<p>This path is also used to search for .mod files when
previously compiled modules are required by a
&quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p>-Jdir -Mdir This option specifies where to put .mod
files for compiled modules. It is also added to the list of
directories to searched by an &quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p>The default is the current directory.</p>

<p>-M is deprecated to avoid conflicts with existing GCC
options.</p>

<p>-fintrinsic-modules-path dir This option specifies the
location of pre-compiled intrinsic modules, if they are not
in the default location expected by the compiler.</p>

<p>Influencing the linking step These options come into
play when the compiler links object files into an executable
output file. They are meaningless if the compiler is not
doing a link step.</p>

<p>-static-libgfortran On systems that provide libgfortran
as a shared and a static library, this option forces the use
of the static version. If no shared version of libgfortran
was built when the compiler was configured, this option has
no effect.</p>

<p>Influencing runtime behavior These options affect the
runtime behavior of programs compiled with GNU Fortran.</p>

<p>-fconvert=conversion Specify the representation of data
for unformatted files. Valid values for conversion are:
native, the default; swap, swap between big- and
little-endian; big-endian, use big-endian representation for
unformatted files; little-endian, use little-endian
representation for unformatted files.</p>

<p>This option has an effect only when used in the main
program. The &quot;CONVERT&quot; specifier and the
GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT environment variable override the
default specified by -fconvert.</p>

<p>-fno-range-check Disable range checking of input values
during integer &quot;READ&quot; operations. For example, GNU
Fortran will give an error if an input value is outside of
the relevant range of
[&quot;-HUGE()&quot;:&quot;HUGE()&quot;]. In other words,
with &quot;INTEGER (kind=4) :: i&quot; , attempting to read
-2147483648 will give an error unless -fno-range-check is
given.</p>

<p>-frecord-marker=length Specify the length of record
markers for unformatted files. Valid values for length are 4
and 8. Default is 4. This is different from previous
versions of gfortran, which specified a default record
marker length of 8 on most systems. If you want to read or
write files compatible with earlier versions of gfortran,
use -frecord-marker=8.</p>

<p>-fmax-subrecord-length=length Specify the maximum length
for a subrecord. The maximum permitted value for length is
2147483639, which is also the default. Only really useful
for use by the gfortran testsuite.</p>

<p>-fsign-zero When writing zero values, show the negative
sign if the sign bit is set. &quot;fno-sign-zero&quot; does
not print the negative sign of zero values for compatibility
with F77. Default behavior is to show the negative sign.</p>

<p>Options for code generation conventions These
machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one which is
not the default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p>-fno-automatic Treat each program unit (except those
marked as RECURSIVE) as if the &quot;SAVE&quot; statement
were specified for every local variable and array referenced
in it. Does not affect common blocks. (Some Fortran
compilers provide this option under the name -static or
-save.) The default, which is -fautomatic, uses the stack
for local variables smaller than the value given by
-fmax-stack-var-size. Use the option -frecursive to use no
static memory.</p>

<p>-ff2c Generate code designed to be compatible with code
generated by g77 and f2c.</p>

<p>The calling conventions used by g77 (originally
implemented in f2c) require functions that return type
default &quot;REAL&quot; to actually return the C type
&quot;double&quot;, and functions that return type
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; to return the values via an extra
argument in the calling sequence that points to where to
store the return value. Under the default GNU calling
conventions, such functions simply return their results as
they would in GNU C---default &quot;REAL&quot; functions
return the C type &quot;float&quot;, and &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
functions return the GNU C type &quot;complex&quot;.
Additionally, this option implies the -fsecond-underscore
option, unless -fno-second-underscore is explicitly
requested.</p>

<p>This does not affect the generation of code that
interfaces with the libgfortran library.</p>

<p>Caution: It is not a good idea to mix Fortran code
compiled with -ff2c with code compiled with the default
-fno-f2c calling conventions as, calling &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
or default &quot;REAL&quot; functions between program parts
which were compiled with different calling conventions will
break at execution time.</p>

<p>Caution: This will break code which passes intrinsic
functions of type default &quot;REAL&quot; or
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; as actual arguments, as the library
implementations use the -fno-f2c calling conventions.</p>

<p>-fno-underscoring Do not transform names of entities
specified in the Fortran source file by appending
underscores to them.</p>

<p>With -funderscoring in effect, GNU Fortran appends one
underscore to external names with no underscores. This is
done to ensure compatibility with code produced by many UNIX
Fortran compilers.</p>

<p>Caution: The default behavior of GNU Fortran is
incompatible with f2c and g77, please use the -ff2c option
if you want object files compiled with GNU Fortran to be
compatible with object code created with these tools.</p>

<p>Use of -fno-underscoring is not recommended unless you
are experimenting with issues such as integration of GNU
Fortran into existing system environments (vis-@ {a}-vis
existing libraries, tools, and so on).</p>

<p>For example, with -funderscoring, and assuming other
defaults like -fcase-lower and that &quot;j()&quot; and
&quot;max_count()&quot; are external functions while
&quot;my_var&quot; and &quot;lvar&quot; are local variables,
a statement like</p>

<p>I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR, LVAR)</p>

<p>is implemented as something akin to:</p>

<p>i = j_() + max_count__(&amp;my_var__, &amp;lvar);</p>

<p>With -fno-underscoring, the same statement is
implemented as:</p>

<p>i = j() + max_count(&amp;my_var, &amp;lvar);</p>

<p>Use of -fno-underscoring allows direct specification of
user- defined names while debugging and when interfacing GNU
Fortran code with other languages.</p>

<p>Note that just because the names match does not mean
that the interface implemented by GNU Fortran for an
external name matches the interface implemented by some
other language for that same name. That is, getting code
produced by GNU Fortran to link to code produced by some
other compiler using this or any other method can be only a
small part of the overall solution---getting the code
generated by both compilers to agree on issues other than
naming can require significant effort, and, unlike naming
disagreements, linkers normally cannot detect disagreements
in these other areas.</p>

<p>Also, note that with -fno-underscoring, the lack of
appended underscores introduces the very real possibility
that a user- defined external name will conflict with a name
in a system library, which could make finding
unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in some
cases---they might occur at program run time, and show up
only as buggy behavior at run time.</p>

<p>In future versions of GNU Fortran we hope to improve
naming and linking issues so that debugging always involves
using the names as they appear in the source, even if the
names as seen by the linker are mangled to prevent
accidental linking between procedures with incompatible
interfaces.</p>

<p>-fsecond-underscore By default, GNU Fortran appends an
underscore to external names. If this option is used GNU
Fortran appends two underscores to names with underscores
and one underscore to external names with no underscores.
GNU Fortran also appends two underscores to internal names
with underscores to avoid naming collisions with external
names.</p>

<p>This option has no effect if -fno-underscoring is in
effect. It is implied by the -ff2c option.</p>

<p>Otherwise, with this option, an external name such as
&quot;MAX_COUNT&quot; is implemented as a reference to the
link-time external symbol &quot;max_count__&quot;, instead
of &quot;max_count_&quot;. This is required for
compatibility with g77 and f2c, and is implied by use of the
-ff2c option.</p>

<p>-fbounds-check Enable generation of run-time checks for
array subscripts and against the declared minimum and
maximum values. It also checks array indices for assumed and
deferred shape arrays against the actual allocated bounds
and ensures that all string lengths are equal for character
array constructors without an explicit typespec.</p>

<p>Some checks require that -fbounds-check is set for the
compilation of the main program.</p>

<p>Note: In the future this may also include other forms of
checking, e.g., checking substring references.</p>

<p>fcheck-array-temporaries Warns at run time when for
passing an actual argument a temporary array had to be
generated. The information generated by this warning is
sometimes useful in optimization, in order to avoid such
temporaries.</p>

<p>Note: The warning is only printed once per location.</p>

<p>-fmax-array-constructor=n This option can be used to
increase the upper limit permitted in array constructors.
The code below requires this option to expand the array at
compile time.</p>

<p>C&lt;program test&gt; C&lt;implicit none&gt;
C&lt;integer j&gt; C&lt;integer, parameter :: n = 100000&gt;
C&lt;integer, parameter :: i(n) = (/ (2*j, j = 1, n) /)&gt;
C&lt;print &rsquo;(10(I0,1X))&rsquo;, i&gt; C&lt;end program
test&gt;</p>

<p>Caution: This option can lead to long compile times and
excessively large object files.</p>

<p>The default value for n is 65535.</p>

<p>-fmax-stack-var-size=n This option specifies the size in
bytes of the largest array that will be put on the stack; if
the size is exceeded static memory is used (except in
procedures marked as RECURSIVE). Use the option -frecursive
to allow for recursive procedures which do not have a
RECURSIVE attribute or for parallel programs. Use
-fno-automatic to never use the stack.</p>

<p>This option currently only affects local arrays declared
with constant bounds, and may not apply to all character
variables. Future versions of GNU Fortran may improve this
behavior.</p>

<p>The default value for n is 32768.</p>

<p>-fpack-derived This option tells GNU Fortran to pack
derived type members as closely as possible. Code compiled
with this option is likely to be incompatible with code
compiled without this option, and may execute slower.</p>

<p>-frepack-arrays In some circumstances GNU Fortran may
pass assumed shape array sections via a descriptor
describing a noncontiguous area of memory. This option adds
code to the function prologue to repack the data into a
contiguous block at runtime.</p>

<p>This should result in faster accesses to the array.
However it can introduce significant overhead to the
function call, especially when the passed data is
noncontiguous.</p>

<p>-fshort-enums This option is provided for
interoperability with C code that was compiled with the
-fshort-enums option. It will make GNU Fortran choose the
smallest &quot;INTEGER&quot; kind a given enumerator set
will fit in, and give all its enumerators this kind.</p>

<p>-fexternal-blas This option will make gfortran generate
calls to BLAS functions for some matrix operations like
&quot;MATMUL&quot;, instead of using our own algorithms, if
the size of the matrices involved is larger than a given
limit (see -fblas-matmul-limit). This may be profitable if
an optimized vendor BLAS library is available. The BLAS
library will have to be specified at link time.</p>

<p>-fblas-matmul-limit=n Only significant when
-fexternal-blas is in effect. Matrix multiplication of
matrices with size larger than (or equal to) n will be
performed by calls to BLAS functions, while others will be
handled by gfortran internal algorithms. If the matrices
involved are not square, the size comparison is performed
using the geometric mean of the dimensions of the argument
and result matrices.</p>

<p>The default value for n is 30.</p>

<p>-frecursive Allow indirect recursion by forcing all
local arrays to be allocated on the stack. This flag cannot
be used together with -fmax-stack-var-size= or
-fno-automatic.</p>

<p>-finit-local-zero -finit-integer=n
-finit-real=&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan&gt;
-finit-logical=&lt;true|false&gt; -finit-character=n The
-finit-local-zero option instructs the compiler to
initialize local &quot;INTEGER&quot;, &quot;REAL&quot;, and
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; variables to zero, &quot;LOGICAL&quot;
variables to false, and &quot;CHARACTER&quot; variables to a
string of null bytes. Finer-grained initialization options
are provided by the -finit-integer=n,
-finit-real=&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan&gt; (which also
initializes the real and imaginary parts of local
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; variables),
-finit-logical=&lt;true|false&gt;, and -finit-character=n
(where n is an ASCII character value) options. These options
do not initialize components of derived type variables, nor
do they initialize variables that appear in an
&quot;EQUIVALENCE&quot; statement. (This limitation may be
removed in future releases).</p>

<p>Note that the -finit-real=nan option initializes
&quot;REAL&quot; and &quot;COMPLEX&quot; variables with a
quiet NaN.</p>

<p>-falign-commons By default, gfortran enforces proper
alignment of all variables in a COMMON block by padding them
as needed. On certain platforms this is mandatory, on others
it increases performance. If a COMMON block is not declared
with consistent data types everywhere, this padding can
cause trouble, and -fno-align-commons can be used to disable
automatic alignment. The same form of this option should be
used for all files that share a COMMON block. To avoid
potential alignment issues in COMMON blocks, it is
recommended to order objects from largests to smallest.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The gfortran compiler currently does not
make use of any environment variables to control its
operation above and beyond those that affect the operation
of gcc.</p>
