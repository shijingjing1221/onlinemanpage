DEVICE_CREATE_VARGS(9)</p>

<p>NAME device_create_vargs - creates a device and
registers it with sysfs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct device * device_create_vargs(struct
class * class, struct device * parent, dev_t devt, void *
drvdata, const char * fmt, va_list args);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS class pointer to the struct class that this
device should be registered to</p>

<p>parent pointer to the parent struct device of this new
device, if any</p>

<p>devt the dev_t for the char device to be added</p>

<p>drvdata the data to be added to the device for
callbacks</p>

<p>fmt string for the device&acute;s name</p>

<p>args va_list for the device&acute;s name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function can be used by char device
classes. A struct device will be created in sysfs,
registered to the specified class.</p>

<p>A dev file will be created, showing the dev_t for the
device, if the dev_t is not 0,0. If a pointer to a parent
struct device is passed in, the newly created struct device
will be a child of that device in sysfs. The pointer to the
struct device will be returned from the call. Any further
sysfs files that might be required can be created using this
pointer.</p>

<p>NOTE the struct class passed to this function must have
previously been created with a call to class_create.</p>
