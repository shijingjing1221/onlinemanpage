<p>NAME pnmpaste - paste a rectangle into a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmpaste</p>

<p>[-replace|-or|-and|-xor]</p>

<p>frompnmfile x y [intopnmfile]</p>

<p>You can abbreviate all options to their shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmpaste reads two PNM images as input and inserts the
first image (the &quot;pasted image&quot;) into the second
(the &quot;base image&quot;) at the specified location, and
produces a PNM image the same size and type as the base
image as output. If you dont specify the second file,
pnmpaste reads the base image from Standard Input.</p>

<p>x and y specify the location in the base image at which
to put the top left corner of the pasted image, x giving the
horizontal position and x giving the vertical position. A
nonnegative value indicates the number of pixels right of
the right edge or below the top edge of the base image,
while a negative value indicates the number of pixels right
of the right edge or below the bottom edge (so x = -5 means
5 pixels left of the right edge).</p>

<p>If any part of the pasted image does not fit within the
base image, pnmpaste fails.</p>

<p>This tool is most useful in combination with pamcut. For
instance, if you want to edit a small segment of a large
image, and your image edi- tor cannot edit the large image,
you can cut out the segment you are interested in, edit it,
and then paste it back in.</p>

<p>Another useful companion tool is pbmmask.</p>

<p>pamcomp is a more general tool, except that it lacks the
or, and, and xor functions. pamcomp allows you to specify an
alpha mask in order to have only part of the inserted image
get inserted. So the inserted pixels need not be a
rectangle. You can also have the inserted image be
translucent, so the resulting image is a mixture of the
inserted image and the base image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The option specifies the operation to use when
doing the paste. The default is -replace, which means to do
the obvious paste: replace pix- els of the into image with
those of the from image.</p>

<p>-and, -or, and -xor are allowed only if both input
images are PBM images. They say to combine the from and into
images by performing boolean operations: Each pixel of the
output image is the result of the boolean operation on the
corresponding pixels of the two input image, where white is
TRUE and black is FALSE.</p>

<p>Note that this is different from what you would get by
doing a bit arithmetic on the bits in the PBM images,
because in PBM, white is represented by a 0 bit, and 0 in
bit arithmetic corresponds to FALSE in boolean
arithmetic.</p>
