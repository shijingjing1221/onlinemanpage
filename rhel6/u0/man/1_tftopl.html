<p>TFTOPL(1) TFTOPL(1)</p>

<p>NAME tftopl - convert TeX font metric (tfm) files to
property lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tftopl [ -charcode-format=format ] [ -verbose ]
tfm_name[.tfm] [ pl_name[.pl] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The tftopl program translates a (program-oriented) font
metric file to a (human-oriented) property list file. Thus,
you can edit the contents of the TFM files, if the font
designer has not done his or her job properly, or if youre
encountering strange difficulties, or if youre just curious.
It also serves as a TFM-file validating program, i.e., if no
error messages are given, the input file is correct.</p>

<p>The pl_name is extended with .pl if it lacks a suffix.
If pl_name is not given, standard output is used. Likewise,
tfm_name is extended with .tfm if it lacks a suffix. Also,
path searching is done for the .tfm file using the
environment variable TEXFONTS. If that is not set, tftopl
uses the system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The argument format to -charcode-format
specifies how character codes are output in the PL file. By
default, only letters and digits are output using the C
integer code (i.e., in ASCII); the others are output in
octal. (Unless the fonts coding scheme starts with TeX math
sy or TeX math ex, in which case all character codes are
output in octal.) If format is ascii, all character codes
that correspond to graphic characters, besides the left and
right parentheses, are output in ASCII. Finally, if format
is octal, all character codes are output in octal.</p>

<p>Without the -verbose option, tftopl operates silently.
With it, a ban- ner and progress report are printed on
stdout.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Donald E. Knuth wrote the program. It was
published as part of the TeX for nroffware technical report,
available from the TeX Users Group. Howard Trickey and Pavel
Curtis originally ported it to Unix.</p>
