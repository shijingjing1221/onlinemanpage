<p>FGETWS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FGETWS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fgetws - get a wide-character string from a
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t *restrict ws, int n, FILE
*restrict stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fgetws() function shall read characters
from the stream, convert these to the corresponding
wide-character codes, place them in the wchar_t array
pointed to by ws, until n-1 characters are read, or a
&lt;newline&gt; is read, converted, and transferred to ws,
or an end-of-file condition is encountered. The
wide-character string, ws, shall then be terminated with a
null wide-character code.</p>

<p>If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file
position indicator for the stream is unspecified.</p>

<p>The fgetws() function may mark the st_atime field of the
file associ- ated with stream for update. The st_atime field
shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of fgetc(), fgets(), fgetwc(), fgetws(), fread(), fscanf(),
getc(), getchar(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc() or
ungetwc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fgetws() shall
return ws. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file
indicator for the stream shall be set and fgetws() shall
return a null pointer. If a read error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream shall be set, fgetws() shall return
a null pointer, and shall set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetwc().</p>
