<p>INET_NTOP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual INET_NTOP(3)</p>

<p>NAME inet_ntop - convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from
binary to text form</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p>

<p>const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *src, char
*dst, socklen_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function converts the network address
structure src in the af address family into a character
string. The resulting string is copied to the buffer pointed
to by dst, which must be a non-NULL pointer. The caller
specifies the number of bytes available in this buffer in
the argument size.</p>

<p>inet_ntop() extends the inet_ntoa(3) function to support
multiple address families, inet_ntoa(3) is now considered to
be deprecated in favor of inet_ntop(). The following address
families are currently supported:</p>

<p>AF_INET src points to a struct in_addr (in network byte
order) which is converted to an IPv4 network address in the
dotted-decimal for- mat, &quot;ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd&quot;. The
buffer dst must be at least INET_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.</p>

<p>AF_INET6 src points to a struct in6_addr (in network
byte order) which is converted to a representation of this
address in the most appro- priate IPv6 network address
format for this address. The buffer dst must be at least
INET6_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, inet_ntop() returns a non-null
pointer to dst. NULL is returned if there was an error, with
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAFNOSUPPORT af was not a valid address
family.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The converted address string would exceed the
size given by size.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001. Note that RFC 2553 defines a
prototype where the last argument size is of type size_t.
Many systems follow RFC 2553. Glibc 2.0 and 2.1 have size_t,
but 2.2 and later have socklen_t.</p>

<p>BUGS AF_INET6 converts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses into
an IPv6 format.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See inet_pton(3).</p>
