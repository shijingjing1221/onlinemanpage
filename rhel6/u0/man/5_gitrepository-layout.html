<p>GITREPOSITORY-LAYOU(5) Git Manual
GITREPOSITORY-LAYOU(5)</p>

<p>NAME gitrepository-layout - Git Repository Layout</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $GIT_DIR/*</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You may find these things in your git
repository (.git directory for a repository associated with
your working tree, or &lt;project&gt;.git directory for a
public bare repository. It is also possible to have a
working tree where .git is a plain ascii file containing
gitdir: &lt;path&gt;, i.e. the path to the real git
repository).</p>

<p>objects Object store associated with this repository.
Usually an object store is self sufficient (i.e. all the
objects that are referred to by an object found in it are
also found in it), but there are couple of ways to violate
it.</p>

<p>1. You could populate the repository by running a commit
walker without -a option. Depending on which options are
given, you could have only commit objects without associated
blobs and trees this way, for example. A repository with
this kind of incomplete object store is not suitable to be
published to the outside world but sometimes useful for
private repository.</p>

<p>2. You also could have an incomplete but locally usable
repository by cloning shallowly. See git-clone(1).</p>

<p>3. You can be using objects/info/alternates mechanism,
or $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES mechanism to borrow
objects from other object stores. A repository with this
kind of incomplete object store is not suitable to be
published for use with dumb transports but otherwise is OK
as long as objects/info/alternates points at the right
object stores it borrows from.</p>

<p>objects/[0-9a-f][0-9a-f] Traditionally, each object is
stored in its own file. They are split into 256
subdirectories using the first two letters from its object
name to keep the number of directory entries objects
directory itself needs to hold. Objects found here are often
called unpacked (or loose) objects.</p>

<p>objects/pack Packs (files that store many object in
compressed form, along with index files to allow them to be
randomly accessed) are found in this directory.</p>

<p>objects/info Additional information about the object
store is recorded in this directory.</p>

<p>objects/info/packs This file is to help dumb transports
discover what packs are available in this object store.
Whenever a pack is added or removed, git update-server-info
should be run to keep this file up-to-date if the repository
is published for dumb transports. git repack does this by
default.</p>

<p>objects/info/alternates This file records paths to
alternate object stores that this object store borrows
objects from, one pathname per line. Note that not only
native Git tools use it locally, but the HTTP fetcher also
tries to use it remotely; this will usually work if you have
relative paths (relative to the object database, not to the
repository!) in your alternates file, but it will not work
if you use absolute paths unless the absolute path in
filesystem and web URL is the same. See also
objects/info/http-alternates.</p>

<p>objects/info/http-alternates This file records URLs to
alternate object stores that this object store borrows
objects from, to be used when the repository is fetched over
HTTP.</p>

<p>refs References are stored in subdirectories of this
directory. The git prune command knows to keep objects
reachable from refs found in this directory and its
subdirectories.</p>

<p>refs/heads/name records tip-of-the-tree commit objects
of branch name</p>

<p>refs/tags/name records any object name (not necessarily
a commit object, or a tag object that points at a commit
object).</p>

<p>refs/remotes/name records tip-of-the-tree commit objects
of branches copied from a remote repository.</p>

<p>packed-refs records the same information as refs/heads/,
refs/tags/, and friends record in a more efficient way. See
git-pack-refs(1).</p>

<p>HEAD A symref (see glossary) to the refs/heads/
namespace describing the currently active branch. It does
not mean much if the repository is not associated with any
working tree (i.e. a bare repository), but a valid git
repository must have the HEAD file; some porcelains may use
it to guess the designated &quot;default&quot; branch of the
repository (usually master). It is legal if the named branch
name does not (yet) exist. In some legacy setups, it is a
symbolic link instead of a symref that points at the current
branch.</p>

<p>HEAD can also record a specific commit directly, instead
of being a symref to point at the current branch. Such a
state is often called detached HEAD, and almost all commands
work identically as normal. See git-checkout(1) for
details.</p>

<p>branches A slightly deprecated way to store shorthands
to be used to specify URL to git fetch, git pull and git
push commands is to store a file in branches/&lt;name&gt;
and give name to these commands in place of repository
argument.</p>

<p>hooks Hooks are customization scripts used by various
git commands. A handful of sample hooks are installed when
git init is run, but all of them are disabled by default. To
enable, the .sample suffix has to be removed from the
filename by renaming. Read githooks(5) for more details
about each hook.</p>

<p>index The current index file for the repository. It is
usually not found in a bare repository.</p>

<p>info Additional information about the repository is
recorded in this directory.</p>

<p>info/refs This file helps dumb transports discover what
refs are available in this repository. If the repository is
published for dumb transports, this file should be
regenerated by git update-server-info every time a tag or
branch is created or modified. This is normally done from
the hooks/update hook, which is run by the git-receive-pack
command when you git push into the repository.</p>

<p>info/grafts This file records fake commit ancestry
information, to pretend the set of parents a commit has is
different from how the commit was actually created. One
record per line describes a commit and its fake parents by
listing their 40-byte hexadecimal object names separated by
a space and terminated by a newline.</p>

<p>info/exclude This file, by convention among Porcelains,
stores the exclude pattern list. .gitignore is the
per-directory ignore file. git status, git add, git rm and
git clean look at it but the core git commands do not look
at it. See also: gitignore(5).</p>

<p>remotes Stores shorthands to be used to give URL and
default refnames to interact with remote repository to git
fetch, git pull and git push commands.</p>

<p>logs Records of changes made to refs are stored in this
directory. See git-update-ref(1) for more information.</p>

<p>logs/refs/heads/name Records all changes made to the
branch tip named name.</p>

<p>logs/refs/tags/name Records all changes made to the tag
named name.</p>

<p>shallow This is similar to info/grafts but is internally
used and maintained by shallow clone mechanism. See --depth
option to git- clone(1) and git-fetch(1).</p>
