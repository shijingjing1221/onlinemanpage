<p>COMMAND(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual COMMAND(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME command - execute a simple command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS command [-p] command_name [argument ...]</p>

<p>command [ -v | -V ] command_name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command utility shall cause the shell to
treat the arguments as a simple command, suppressing the
shell function lookup that is described in Command Search
and Execution, item 1b.</p>

<p>If the command_name is the same as the name of one of
the special built-in utilities, the special properties in
the enumerated list at the beginning of Special Built-In
Utilities shall not occur. In every other respect, if
command_name is not the name of a function, the effect of
command (with no options) shall be the same as omitting com-
mand.</p>

<p>On systems supporting the User Portability Utilities
option, the com- mand utility also shall provide information
concerning how a command name is interpreted by the shell;
see -v and -V.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The command utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p Perform the command search using a default value for
PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the standard
utilities.</p>

<p>-v (On systems supporting the User Portability Utilities
option.) Write a string to standard output that indicates
the pathname or command that will be used by the shell, in
the current shell execution environment (see Shell Execution
Environment ), to invoke command_name, but do not invoke
command_name.</p>

<p>* Utilities, regular built-in utilities, command_names
includ- ing a slash character, and any
implementation-defined func- tions that are found using the
PATH variable (as described in Command Search and Execution
), shall be written as absolute pathnames.</p>

<p>* Shell functions, special built-in utilities, regular
built-in utilities not associated with a PATH search, and
shell reserved words shall be written as just their
names.</p>

<p>* An alias shall be written as a command line that
represents its alias definition.</p>

<p>* Otherwise, no output shall be written and the exit
status shall reflect that the name was not found.</p>

<p>-V (On systems supporting the User Portability Utilities
option.) Write a string to standard output that indicates
how the name given in the command_name operand will be
interpreted by the shell, in the current shell execution
environment (see Shell Execution Environment ), but do not
invoke command_name. Although the format of this string is
unspecified, it shall indicate in which of the following
categories command_name falls and shall include the
information stated:</p>

<p>* Utilities, regular built-in utilities, and any
implementa- tion-defined functions that are found using the
PATH variable (as described in Command Search and Execution
), shall be identified as such and include the absolute
pathname in the string.</p>

<p>* Other shell functions shall be identified as
functions.</p>

<p>* Aliases shall be identified as aliases and their
definitions included in the string.</p>

<p>* Special built-in utilities shall be identified as
special built-in utilities.</p>

<p>* Regular built-in utilities not associated with a PATH
search shall be identified as regular built-in utilities.
(The term &quot;regular&quot; need not be used.)</p>

<p>* Shell reserved words shall be identified as reserved
words.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>argument One of the strings treated as an argument to
command_name.</p>

<p>command_name</p>

<p>The name of a utility or a special built-in utility.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of com- mand:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the search path used during the command
search described in Command Search and Execution, except as
described under the -p option.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When the -v option is specified, standard output
shall be formatted as:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;pathname or command&gt;</p>

<p>When the -V option is specified, standard output shall
be formatted as:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;unspecified&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When the -v or -V options are specified, the
following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 The command_name could not be found or an error
occurred.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>126 The utility specified by command_name was found but
could not be invoked.</p>

<p>127 An error occurred in the command utility or the
utility speci- fied by command_name could not be found.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the exit status of command shall be that of
the simple com- mand specified by the arguments to
command.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The order for command search allows
functions to override regular built-ins and path searches.
This utility is necessary to allow func- tions that have the
same name as a utility to call the utility (instead of a
recursive call to the function).</p>

<p>The system default path is available using getconf;
however, since get- conf may need to have the PATH set up
before it can be called itself, the following can be
used:</p>

<p>command -p getconf _CS_PATH</p>

<p>There are some advantages to suppressing the special
characteristics of special built-ins on occasion. For
example:</p>

<p>command exec &gt; unwritable-file</p>

<p>does not cause a non-interactive script to abort, so
that the output status can be checked by the script.</p>

<p>The command, env, nohup, time, and xargs utilities have
been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so
that applications can dis- tinguish &quot;failure to find a
utility&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an
error indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it
is not com- monly used for other meanings; most utilities
use small values for &quot;normal error conditions&quot; and
the values above 128 can be confused with termination due to
receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar
manner to indicate that the utility could be found, but not
invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction
between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell
practice that uses 127 when all attempts to exec the utility
fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when any attempt to exec
the utility fails for any other reason.</p>

<p>Since the -v and -V options of command produce output in
relation to the current shell execution environment, command
is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p>(PATH=foo command -v) nohup command -v</p>

<p>it does not necessarily produce correct results. For
example, when called with nohup or an exec function, in a
separate utility execution environment, most implementations
are not able to identify aliases, functions, or special
built-ins.</p>

<p>Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered on a
system and these are described separately by command. The
description of command search in Command Search and
Execution allows for a standard utility to be implemented as
a regular built-in as long as it is found in the appropriate
place in a PATH search. So, for example, command -v true
might yield /bin/true or some similar pathname. Other
implementation- defined utilities that are not defined by
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 might exist only as
built-ins and have no pathname associated with them. These
produce output identified as (regular) built-ins.
Applications encountering these are not able to count on
execing them, using them with nohup, overriding them with a
different PATH, and so on.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Make a version of cd that always prints out
the new working direc- tory exactly once:</p>

<p>cd() { command cd &quot;$@&quot; &gt;/dev/null pwd }</p>

<p>2. Start off a &quot;secure shell script&quot; in which
the script avoids being spoofed by its parent:</p>

<p>IFS= # The preceding value should be
&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;. # Set IFS to its
default value.</p>

<p>unalias -a # Unset all possible aliases. # Note that
unalias is escaped to prevent an alias # being used for
unalias.</p>

<p>unset -f command # Ensure command is not a user
function.</p>

<p>PATH=&quot;$(command -p getconf _CS_PATH):$PATH&quot; #
Put on a reliable PATH prefix.</p>

<p># ...</p>

<p>At this point, given correct permissions on the
directories called by PATH, the script has the ability to
ensure that any utility it calls is the intended one. It is
being very cautious because it assumes that implementation
extensions may be present that would allow user func- tions
to exist when it is invoked; this capability is not
specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, but it is
not prohibited as an extension. For example, the ENV
variable precedes the invocation of the script with a user
start-up script. Such a script could define functions to
spoof the application.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since command is a regular built-in utility it
is always found prior to the PATH search.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the description of command that
implies the command line is parsed any differently from that
of any other simple command. For example:</p>

<p>command a | b ; c</p>

<p>is not parsed in any special way that causes|or;to be
treated other than a pipe operator or semicolon or that
prevents function lookup on b or c.</p>

<p>The command utility is somewhat similar to the Eighth
Edition shell builtin command, but since command also goes
to the file system to search for utilities, the name builtin
would not be intuitive.</p>

<p>The command utility is most likely to be provided as a
regular built- in. It is not listed as a special built-in
for the following reasons:</p>

<p>* The removal of exportable functions made the special
precedence of a special built-in unnecessary.</p>

<p>* A special built-in has special properties (see Special
Built-In Utilities ) that were inappropriate for invoking
other utilities. For example, two commands such as:</p>

<p>date &gt; unwritable-file</p>

<p>command date &gt; unwritable-file</p>

<p>would have entirely different results; in a
non-interactive script, the former would continue to execute
the next command, the latter would abort. Introducing this
semantic difference along with suppressing functions was
seen to be non-intuitive.</p>

<p>The -p option is present because it is useful to be able
to ensure a safe path search that finds all the standard
utilities. This search might not be identical to the one
that occurs through one of the exec functions (as defined in
the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) when
PATH is unset. At the very least, this fea- ture is required
to allow the script to access the correct version of getconf
so that the value of the default path can be accurately
retrieved.</p>

<p>The command -v and -V options were added to satisfy
requirements from users that are currently accomplished by
three different historical utilities: type in the System V
shell, whence in the KornShell, and which in the C shell.
Since there is no historical agreement on how and what to
accomplish here, the POSIX command utility was enhanced and
the historical utilities were left unmodified. The C shell
which merely conducts a path search. The KornShell whence is
more elaborate-in addi- tion to the categories required by
POSIX, it also reports on tracked aliases, exported aliases,
and undefined functions.</p>

<p>The output format of -V was left mostly unspecified
because human users are its only audience. Applications
should not be written to care about this information; they
can use the output of -v to differentiate between various
types of commands, but the additional information that may
be emitted by the more verbose -V is not needed and should
not be arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or
localization for applica- tion parsing reasons.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
