<p>VTYSH(1) Version 0.96.5 VTYSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME vtysh - a integrated shell for Quagga routing
software</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vtysh [ -b ] vtysh [ -E ] [ -d daemon ] ] [ -c
command ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vtysh is a integrated shell for Quagga
routing engine.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options available for the vtysh command:</p>

<p>-b, --boot Execute boot startup configuration. It makes
sense only if inte- grated config file is in use (not
default in Quagga). See Info file Quagga for more info.</p>

<p>-c, --command command Specify command to be executed
under batch mode. It behaves like -c option in any other
shell - command is executed and vtysh exits.</p>

<p>Its useful for gathering info from Quagga routing
software or reconfiguring daemons from inside shell scripts,
etc. Note that multiple commands may be executed by using
more than one -c option and/or embedding linefeed characters
inside the command string.</p>

<p>-d, --daemon daemon_name Specify which daemon to connect
to. By default, vtysh attempts to connect to all Quagga
daemons running on the system. With this flag, one can
specify a single daemon to connect to instead. For example,
specifying -d ospfd will connect only to ospfd. This can be
particularly useful inside scripts with -c where the command
is targeted for a single daemon.</p>

<p>-e, --execute command Alias for -c. Its here only for
compatibility with Zebra rout- ing software and older Quagga
versions. This will be removed in future.</p>

<p>-E, --echo When the -c option is being used, this flag
will cause the stan- dard vtysh prompt and command to be
echoed prior to displaying the results. This is particularly
useful to separate the results when executing multiple
commands.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a usage message on standard output
and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES VTYSH_PAGER This should be the
name of the pager to use. Default is more.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/etc/vtysh.conf The default location of
the vtysh config file.</p>

<p>/usr/local/etc/Quagga.conf The default location of the
integrated Quagga routing engine config file if integrated
config file is in use (not default).</p>

<p>WARNING This man page is intended to be a quick
reference for command line options. The definitive document
is the Info file Quagga.</p>
