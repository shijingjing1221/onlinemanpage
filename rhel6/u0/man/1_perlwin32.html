<p>PERLWIN32(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLWIN32(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlwin32 - Perl under Windows</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS These are instructions for building Perl under
Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP on the Intel x86 and Itanium
architectures.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Before you start, you should glance through
the README file found in the top-level directory to which
the Perl distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and
understand the terms under which this software is being
distributed.</p>

<p>Also make sure you read &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot;
below for the known limitations of this port.</p>

<p>The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much
information that is only relevant to people building Perl on
Unix-like systems. In particular, you can safely ignore any
information that talks about &quot;Configure&quot;.</p>

<p>You may also want to look at two other options for
building a perl that will work on Windows NT: the
README.cygwin and README.os2 files, each of which give a
different set of rules to build a Perl that will work on
Win32 platforms. Those two methods will probably enable you
to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need
to download and use various other build-time and run-time
support software described in those files.</p>

<p>This set of instructions is meant to describe a
so-called &quot;native&quot; port of Perl to Win32
platforms. This includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no additional
software to run (other than what came with your operating
system). Currently, this port is capable of using one of the
following compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:</p>

<p>Borland C++ version 5.02 or later Microsoft Visual C++
version 2.0 or later MinGW with gcc gcc version 2.95.2 or
later</p>

<p>The last of these is a high quality freeware compiler.
Use version 3.2.x or later for the best results with this
compiler.</p>

<p>The Borland C++ and Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are
also now being given away free. The Borland compiler is
available as &quot;Borland C++ Compiler Free Command Line
Tools&quot; and is the same compiler that ships with the
full &quot;Borland C++ Builder&quot; product. The Microsoft
compiler is available as &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot;
or &quot;Visual C++ 2005/2008 Express Edition&quot; (and
also as part of the &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot;) and is
the same compiler that ships with &quot;Visual C++ .NET 2003
Professional&quot; or &quot;Visual C++ 2005/2008
Professional&quot; respectively.</p>

<p>This port can also be built on the Intel IA64 using:</p>

<p>Microsoft Platform SDK Nov 2001 (64-bit compiler and
tools)</p>

<p>The MS Platform SDK can be downloaded from
http://www.microsoft.com/.</p>

<p>This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules
that is used to build extensions to perl). Therefore, you
should be able to build and install most extensions found in
the CPAN sites. See &quot;Usage Hints for Perl on
Win32&quot; below for general hints about this.</p>

<p>Setting Up Perl on Win32 Make You need a
&quot;make&quot; program to build the sources. If you are
using Visual C++ or the Platform SDK tools under Windows
NT/2000/XP, nmake will work. All other builds need
dmake.</p>

<p>dmake is a freely available make that has very nice
macro features and parallelability.</p>

<p>A port of dmake for Windows is available from:</p>

<p>http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/</p>

<p>Fetch and install dmake somewhere on your path.</p>

<p>There exists a minor coexistence problem with dmake and
Borland C++ compilers. Namely, if a distribution has C files
named with mixed case letters, they will be compiled into
appropriate .obj-files named with all lowercase letters, and
every time dmake is invoked to bring files up to date, it
will try to recompile such files again. For example, Tk
distribution has a lot of such files, resulting in needless
recompiles every time dmake is invoked. To avoid this, you
may use the script &quot;sync_ext.pl&quot; after a
successful build. It is available in the win32 subdirectory
of the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p>Command Shell Use the default &quot;cmd&quot; shell that
comes with NT. Some versions of the popular 4DOS/NT shell
have incompatibilities that may cause you trouble. If the
build fails under that shell, try building again with the
cmd shell.</p>

<p>The nmake Makefile also has known incompatibilities with
the &quot;command.com&quot; shell that comes with Windows
9x. You will need to use dmake and makefile.mk to build
under Windows 9x.</p>

<p>The surest way to build it is on Windows NT/2000/XP,
using the cmd shell.</p>

<p>Make sure the path to the build directory does not
contain spaces. The build usually works in this
circumstance, but some tests will fail.</p>

<p>Borland C++ If you are using the Borland compiler, you
will need dmake. (The make that Borland supplies is
seriously crippled and will not work for MakeMaker
builds.)</p>

<p>See &quot;Make&quot; above.</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ The nmake that comes with Visual
C++ will suffice for building. You will need to run the
VCVARS32.BAT file, usually found somewhere like C:DEV4.20
Studio980s will set your build environment.</p>

<p>You can also use dmake to build using Visual C++;
provided, however, you set OSRELEASE to &quot;microsft&quot;
(or whatever the directory name under which the Visual C
dmake configuration lives) in your environment and edit
win32/config.vc to change &quot;make=nmake&quot; into
&quot;make=dmake&quot;. The latter step is only essential if
you want to use dmake as your default make for building
extensions using MakeMaker.</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition This free
version of Visual C++ 2008 Professional contains the same
compiler and linker that ship with the full version, and
also contains everything necessary to build Perl, rather
than requiring a separate download of the Platform SDK like
previous versions did.</p>

<p>This package can be downloaded by searching for
&quot;Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition&quot; in the
Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p>Install Visual C++ 2008, then setup your environment
using</p>

<p>C:Program Filescrosoft Visual Studio
9.0n7Toolsars32.bat</p>

<p>(assuming the default installation location was
chosen).</p>

<p>Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile. You will
need to edit that file to set</p>

<p>CCTYPE = MSVC90FREE</p>

<p>first.</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition This free
version of Visual C++ 2005 Professional contains the same
compiler and linker that ship with the full version, but
doesnt contain everything necessary to build Perl.</p>

<p>You will also need to download the &quot;Platform
SDK&quot; (the &quot;Core SDK&quot; and &quot;MDAC SDK&quot;
components are required) for more header files and
libraries.</p>

<p>These packages can both be downloaded by searching in
the Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p>Try to obtain the latest version of the Platform SDK.
Sometimes these packages contain a particular Windows OS
version in their name, but actually work on other OS
versions too. For example, the &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2
Platform SDK&quot; also runs on Windows XP SP2 and Windows
2000.</p>

<p>According to the download pages these packages are only
supported on Windows 2000/XP/2003, so trying to use these
tools on Windows 95/98/ME and even Windows NT probably wont
work.</p>

<p>Install Visual C++ 2005 first, then the Platform SDK.
Setup your environment as follows (assuming default
installation locations were chosen):</p>

<p>SET PlatformSDKDir=C:Program Filescrosoft Platform
SDK</p>

<p>SET PATH=%SystemRoot%tem32;%SystemRoot%;C:Program
Filescrosoft Visual Studio 8n7IDE;C:Program Filescrosoft
Visual Studio 80 SET INCLUDE=C:Program Filescrosoft Visual
Studio 8INCLUDE;%PlatformSDKDir%include</p>

<p>SET LIB=C:Program Filescrosoft Visual Studio 8;C:Program
Filescrosoft Visual Studio 8.0;%PlatformSDKDir%</p>

<p>SET LIBPATH=C:WINDOWScrosoft.NETamework.0.50727</p>

<p>(The PlatformSDKDir might need to be set differently
depending on which version you are using. Earlier versions
installed into &quot;C:Program Filescrosoft SDK&quot;, while
the latest versions install into version-specific locations
such as &quot;C:Program Filescrosoft Platform SDK for
Windows Server 2003 R2&quot;.)</p>

<p>Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile. You will
need to edit that file to set</p>

<p>CCTYPE = MSVC80FREE</p>

<p>and to set CCHOME, CCINCDIR and CCLIBDIR as per the
environment setup above.</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 This free toolkit
contains the same compiler and linker that ship with Visual
C++ .NET 2003 Professional, but doesnt contain everything
necessary to build Perl.</p>

<p>You will also need to download the &quot;Platform
SDK&quot; (the &quot;Core SDK&quot; and &quot;MDAC SDK&quot;
components are required) for header files, libraries and
rc.exe, and &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot; for more
libraries and nmake.exe. Note that the latter (which also
includes the free compiler and linker) requires the
&quot;.NET Framework Redistributable&quot; to be installed
first. This can be downloaded and installed separately, but
is included in the &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot;
anyway.</p>

<p>These packages can all be downloaded by searching in the
Download Center at
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p>Try to obtain the latest version of the Platform SDK.
Sometimes these packages contain a particular Windows OS
version in their name, but actually work on other OS
versions too. For example, the &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2
Platform SDK&quot; also runs on Windows XP SP2 and Windows
2000.</p>

<p>According to the download pages these packages are only
supported on Windows 2000/XP/2003, so trying to use these
tools on Windows 95/98/ME and even Windows NT probably wont
work.</p>

<p>Install the Toolkit first, then the Platform SDK, then
the .NET Framework SDK. Setup your environment as follows
(assuming default installation locations were chosen):</p>

<p>SET PlatformSDKDir=C:Program Filescrosoft Platform
SDK</p>

<p>SET PATH=%SystemRoot%tem32;%SystemRoot%;C:Program
Filescrosoft Visual n ; % P l a t C++ Toolkit
2003fr%0lescrosoft.NET.10 o r m S D K D SET
INCLUDE=C:Program Filescrosoft Visual C++ Toolkit
2003include;%PlatformSDKDir%include;C:Program Filescrosoft
Visual Studio .NET 20037include</p>

<p>SET LIB=C:Program Filescrosoft Visual C++ Toolkit
2003;%PlatformSDKDir%;C:Program Filescrosoft Visual Studio
.NET 20037</p>

<p>(The PlatformSDKDir might need to be set differently
depending on which version you are using. Earlier versions
installed into &quot;C:Program Filescrosoft SDK&quot;, while
the latest versions install into version-specific locations
such as &quot;C:Program Filescrosoft Platform SDK for
Windows Server 2003 R2&quot;.)</p>

<p>Several required files will still be missing:</p>

<p>&middot; cvtres.exe is required by link.exe when using a
.res file. It is actually installed by the .NET Framework
SDK, but into a location such as the following:</p>

<p>C:WINDOWScrosoft.NETamework.1.4322</p>

<p>Copy it from there to %PlatformSDKDir%0 &middot; lib.exe
is normally used to build libraries, but link.exe with the
/lib option also works, so change win32/config.vc to use it
instead:</p>

<p>Change the line reading:</p>

<p>ar=&rsquo;lib&rsquo;</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>ar=&rsquo;link /lib&rsquo;</p>

<p>It may also be useful to create a batch file called
lib.bat in C:Program Filescrosoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003n
containing:</p>

<p>@echo off link /lib %*</p>

<p>for the benefit of any naughty C extension modules that
you might want to build later which explicitly reference
&quot;lib&quot; rather than taking their value from
$Config{ar}.</p>

<p>&middot; setargv.obj is required to build perlglob.exe
(and perl.exe if the USE_SETARGV option is enabled). The
Platform SDK supplies this object file in source form in
%PlatformSDKDir% Copy setargv.c, cruntime.h and internal.h
from there to some temporary location and build setargv.obj
using</p>

<p>cl.exe /c /I. /D_CRTBLD setargv.c</p>

<p>Then copy setargv.obj to %PlatformSDKDir%</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you dont need perlglob.exe and dont
need to enable the USE_SETARGV option then you can safely
just remove all mention of $(GLOBEXE) from win32/Makefile
and setargv.obj wont be required anyway.</p>

<p>Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile. You will
need to edit that file to set</p>

<p>CCTYPE = MSVC70FREE</p>

<p>and to set CCHOME, CCINCDIR and CCLIBDIR as per the
environment setup above.</p>

<p>Microsoft Platform SDK 64-bit Compiler The nmake that
comes with the Platform SDK will suffice for building Perl.
Make sure you are building within one of the &quot;Build
Environment&quot; shells available after you install the
Platform SDK from the Start Menu.</p>

<p>MinGW release 3 with gcc The latest release of MinGW at
the time of writing is 3.1.0, which contains gcc-3.2.3. It
can be downloaded here:</p>

<p>http://www.mingw.org/</p>

<p>Perl also compiles with earlier releases of gcc (2.95.2
and up). See below for notes about using earlier versions of
MinGW/gcc.</p>

<p>You also need dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on how
to get it.</p>

<p>MinGW release 1 with gcc The MinGW-1.1 bundle contains
gcc-2.95.3.</p>

<p>Make sure you install the binaries that work with
MSVCRT.DLL as indicated in the README for the GCC bundle.
You may need to set up a few environment variables (usually
ran from a batch file).</p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with the version of
gcc-2.95.2-msvcrt.exe released 7 November 1999:</p>

<p>&middot; It left out a fix for certain command line
quotes. To fix this, be sure to download and install the
file fixes/quote-fix-msvcrt.exe from the above ftp
location.</p>

<p>&middot; The definition of the fpos_t type in stdio.h
may be wrong. If your stdio.h has this problem, you will see
an exception when running the test t/lib/io_xs.t. To fix
this, change the typedef for fpos_t from &quot;long&quot; to
&quot;long long&quot; in the file
i386-mingw32msvc/include/stdio.h, and rebuild.</p>

<p>A potentially simpler to install (but probably
soon-to-be-outdated) bundle of the above package with the
mentioned fixes already applied is available here:</p>


<p>http://downloads.ActiveState.com/pub/staff/gsar/gcc-2.95.2-msvcrt.zip
ftp://ftp.ActiveState.com/pub/staff/gsar/gcc-2.95.2-msvcrt.zip</p>

<p>Building &middot; Make sure you are in the
&quot;win32&quot; subdirectory under the perl toplevel. This
directory contains a &quot;Makefile&quot; that will work
with versions of nmake that come with Visual C++ or the
Platform SDK, and a dmake &quot;makefile.mk&quot; that will
work for all supported compilers. The defaults in the dmake
makefile are setup to build using MinGW/gcc.</p>

<p>&middot; Edit the makefile.mk (or Makefile, if you re
using nmake) and change the values of INST_DRV and INST_TOP.
You can also enable various build flags. These are explained
in the makefiles.</p>

<p>Note that it is generally not a good idea to try to
build a perl with INST_DRV and INST_TOP set to a path that
already exists from a previous build. In particular, this
may cause problems with the lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test,
which attempts to build a test program and may end up
building against the installed perls lib/CORE directory
rather than the one being tested.</p>

<p>You will have to make sure that CCTYPE is set correctly
and that CCHOME points to wherever you installed your
compiler.</p>

<p>The default value for CCHOME in the makefiles for Visual
C++ may not be correct for some versions. Make sure the
default exists and is valid.</p>

<p>You may also need to comment out the &quot;DELAYLOAD =
...&quot; line in the Makefile if you re using VC++ 6.0
without the latest service pack and the linker reports an
internal error.</p>

<p>If you are using VC++ 4.2 or earlier then you ll have to
change the /EHsc option in the CXX_FLAG macro to the
equivalent /GX option.</p>

<p>If you have either the source or a library that contains
des_fcrypt(), enable the appropriate option in the makefile.
A ready-to-use version of fcrypt.c, based on the version
originally written by Eric Young at
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/crypt/mirrors/dsi/libdes/, is bundled
with the distribution and CRYPT_SRC is set to use it.
Alternatively, if you have built a library that contains
des_fcrypt(), you can set CRYPT_LIB to point to the library
name. Perl will also build without des_fcrypt(), but the
crypt() builtin will fail at run time.</p>

<p>If you want build some core extensions statically into
perls dll, specify them in the STATIC_EXT macro.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the instructions near the top of the
makefiles carefully.</p>

<p>&middot; Type &quot;dmake&quot; (or &quot;nmake&quot; if
you are using that make).</p>

<p>This should build everything. Specifically, it will
create perl.exe, perl510.dll at the perl toplevel, and
various other extension dll s under the libuto directory. If
the build fails for any reason, make sure you have done the
previous steps correctly.</p>

<p>Testing Perl on Win32 Type &quot;dmake test&quot; (or
&quot;nmake test&quot;). This will run most of the tests
from the testsuite (many tests will be skipped).</p>

<p>There should be no test failures when running under
Windows NT/2000/XP. Many tests will fail under Windows 9x
due to the inferior command shell.</p>

<p>Some test failures may occur if you use a command shell
other than the native &quot;cmd.exe&quot;, or if you are
building from a path that contains spaces. So dont do
that.</p>

<p>If you are running the tests from a emacs shell window,
you may see failures in op/stat.t. Run &quot;dmake
test-notty&quot; in that case.</p>

<p>If youre using the Borland compiler, you may see a
failure in op/taint.t arising from the inability to find the
Borland Runtime DLLs on the system default path. You will
need to copy the DLLs reported by the messages from where
Borland chose to install it, into the Windows system
directory (usually somewhere like C:WINNTTEM32) and rerun
the test.</p>

<p>If you re using Borland compiler versions 5.2 and below,
you may run into problems finding the correct header files
when building extensions. For example, building the
&quot;Tk&quot; extension may fail because both perl and Tk
contain a header file called &quot;patchlevel.h&quot;. The
latest Borland compiler (v5.5) is free of this misbehaviour,
and it even supports an option -VI- for backward (bugward)
compatibility for using the old Borland search algorithm to
locate header files.</p>

<p>If you run the tests on a FAT partition, you may see
some failures for &quot;link()&quot; related tests
(op/write.t, op/stat.t ...). Testing on NTFS avoids these
errors.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you should make sure that during &quot;make
test&quot; you do not have any GNU tool packages in your
path: some toolkits like Unixutils include some tools
(&quot;type&quot; for instance) which override the Windows
ones and makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while
testing to avoid these errors.</p>

<p>Please report any other failures as described under
&quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot;.</p>

<p>Installation of Perl on Win32 Type &quot;dmake
install&quot; (or &quot;nmake install&quot;). This will put
the newly built perl and the libraries under whatever
&quot;INST_TOP&quot; points to in the Makefile. It will also
install the pod documentation under
&quot;$INST_TOPNST_VERod&quot; and HTML versions of the same
under &quot;$INST_TOPNST_VERodl&quot;.</p>

<p>To use the Perl you just installed you will need to add
a new entry to n &quot; , your PATH environment variable:
&quot;$INST_TOPe . g .</p>

<p>n ; % P set PATH=c:erlA T H %</p>

<p>If you opted to uncomment &quot;INST_VER&quot; and
&quot;INST_ARCH&quot; in the makefile then the installation
structure is a little more complicated and you will need to
add two new PATH components instead: n &quot; a n d &quot; $
I N S T &quot;$INST_TOPNST_VER_ T O P N S T _ V E R</p>

<p>n ; c : e r l 5 . 6 . 0 n set PATH=c:erl5.6.03 2 - x 8 6
; % P A T H %</p>

<p>Usage Hints for Perl on Win32 Environment Variables The
installation paths that you set during the build get
compiled into perl, so you dont have to do anything
additional to start using that perl (except add its location
to your PATH variable).</p>

<p>If you put extensions in unusual places, you can set
PERL5LIB to a list of paths separated by semicolons where
you want perl to look for libraries. Look for descriptions
of other environment variables you can set in perlrun.</p>

<p>You can also control the shell that perl uses to run
system() and backtick commands via PERL5SHELL. See
perlrun.</p>

<p>Perl does not depend on the registry, but it can look up
certain default values if you choose to put them there. Perl
attempts to read entries from
&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwarePerl&quot; and
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwarePerl&quot;. Entries in the
former override entries in the latter. One or more of the
following entries (of type REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ) may be
set:</p>

<p>lib-$] version-specific standard library path to add to
@INC lib standard library path to add to @INC sitelib-$]
version-specific site library path to add to @INC sitelib
site library path to add to @INC vendorlib-$]
version-specific vendor library path to add to @INC
vendorlib vendor library path to add to @INC PERL* fallback
for all %ENV lookups that begin with &quot;PERL&quot;</p>

<p>Note the $] in the above is not literal. Substitute
whatever version of perl you want to honor that entry, e.g.
5.6.0. Paths must be separated with semicolons, as usual on
win32.</p>

<p>File Globbing By default, perl handles file globbing
using the File::Glob extension, which provides portable
globbing.</p>

<p>If you want perl to use globbing that emulates the
quirks of DOS filename conventions, you might want to
consider using File::DosGlob to override the internal glob()
implementation. See File::DosGlob for details.</p>

<p>Using perl from the command line If you are accustomed
to using perl from various command-line shells found in UNIX
environments, you will be less than pleased with what
Windows offers by way of a command shell.</p>

<p>The crucial thing to understand about the Windows
environment is that the command line you type in is
processed twice before Perl sees it. First, your command
shell (usually CMD.EXE on Windows NT, and COMMAND.COM on
Windows 9x) preprocesses the command line, to handle
redirection, environment variable expansion, and location of
the executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the
remaining command line into individual arguments, using the
C runtime library upon which Perl was built.</p>

<p>It is particularly important to note that neither the
shell nor the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of
command-line arguments (so wildcards need not be quoted).
Also, the quoting behaviours of the shell and the C runtime
are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are using a
non-standard shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful)
quote character is the double quote (&quot;). It can be used
to protect spaces and other special characters in
arguments.</p>

<p>The Windows NT documentation has almost no description
of how the quoting rules are implemented, but here are some
general observations based on experiments: The C runtime
breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in
argc/argv. Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments
with spaces in them from being split up. You can put a
double quote in an argument by escaping it with a backslash
and enclosing the whole argument within double quotes. The
backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding the
argument will be stripped by the C runtime.</p>

<p>The file redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double
quotes (although there are suggestions that this may not
always be true). Single quotes are not treated as quotes by
the shell or the C runtime, they dont get stripped by the
shell (just to make this type of quoting completely
useless). The caret &quot;^&quot; has also been observed to
behave as a quoting character, but this appears to be a
shell feature, and the caret is not stripped from the
command line, so Perl still sees it (and the C runtime phase
does not treat the caret as a quote character).</p>

<p>Here are some examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot;
shell:</p>

<p>This prints two doublequotes:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;</p>

<p>This does the same:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print</p>

<p>This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot;
to the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; &gt; blurch</p>

<p>This prints &quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears
into nowhereland):</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; 2&gt; nul</p>

<p>This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot;
into the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; 1&gt; blurch</p>

<p>This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager
and prints &quot;bar&quot; on the console:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; | less</p>

<p>This pipes &quot;foo0ar0 to the less pager:</p>

<p>perl -le &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</p>

<p>This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes
&quot;bar&quot; in the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; print STDERR
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;&quot; 2&gt; blurch | less</p>

<p>Discovering the usefulness of the
&quot;command.com&quot; shell on Windows 9x is left as an
exercise to the reader :)</p>

<p>One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command
shell for Windows NT is that it (nearly) always treats a %
character as indicating that environment variable expansion
is needed. Under this shell, it is therefore important to
always double any % characters which you want Perl to see
(for example, for hash variables), even when they are
quoted.</p>

<p>Building Extensions The Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN) offers a wealth of extensions, some of which
require a C compiler to build. Look in http://www.cpan.org/
for more information on CPAN.</p>

<p>Note that not all of the extensions available from CPAN
may work in the Win32 environment; you should check the
information at http://testers.cpan.org/ before investing too
much effort into porting modules that dont readily
build.</p>

<p>Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or
not) can be built, tested and installed with the standard
mantra:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL $MAKE $MAKE test $MAKE install</p>

<p>where $MAKE is whatever make program you have configured
perl to use. Use &quot;perl -V:make&quot; to find out what
this is. Some extensions may not provide a testsuite (so
&quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but
most serious ones do.</p>

<p>It is important that you use a supported make program,
and ensure Config.pm knows about it. If you dont have nmake,
you can either get dmake from the location mentioned earlier
or get an old version of nmake reportedly available
from:</p>


<p>http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe</p>

<p>Another option is to use the make written in Perl,
available from CPAN.</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/</p>

<p>You may also use dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on
how to get it.</p>

<p>Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with
different syntax depending on what make it thinks you are
using. Therefore, it is important that one of the following
values appears in Config.pm:</p>

<p>make=&rsquo;nmake&rsquo; # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
make=&rsquo;dmake&rsquo; # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax any
other value # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax (e.g GNU
make, or Perl make)</p>

<p>If the value doesnt match the make program you want to
use, edit Config.pm to fix it.</p>

<p>If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the
supported C compilers. You must make sure you have set up
the environment for the compiler for command-line
compilation.</p>

<p>If a module does not build for some reason, look
carefully for why it failed, and report problems to the
module author. If it looks like the extension building
support is at fault, report that with full details of how
the build failed using the perlbug utility.</p>

<p>Command-line Wildcard Expansion The default command
shells on DOS descendant operating systems (such as they
are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied to
programs. They consider it the applications job to handle
that. This is commonly achieved by linking the application
(in our case, perl) with startup code that the C runtime
libraries usually provide. However, doing that results in
incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of the argv
expansion code differs depending on the compiler, and it is
even buggy on some compilers). Besides, it may be a source
of frustration if you use such a perl binary with an
alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.</p>

<p>Instead, the following solution works rather well. The
nice things about it are 1) you can start using it right
away; 2) it is more powerful, because it will do the right
thing with a pattern like */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether
you do/dont want to use it; and 4) you can extend the method
to add any customizations (or even entirely different kinds
of wildcard expansion).</p>

<p>C:&gt; copy con c:erlWild.pm # Wild.pm - emulate shell
@ARGV expansion on shells that don&rsquo;t use
File::DosGlob; @ARGV = map { my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_)
if /[*?]/; @g ? @g : $_; } @ARGV; 1; ^Z C:&gt; set
PERL5OPT=-MWild C:&gt; perl -le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print
}&quot; */*/perl*.c p4view/perl/perl.c p4view/perl/perlio.c
p4view/perl/perly.c perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c</p>

<p>Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) Youll have
to create Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2)
You ll need to set the PERL5OPT environment variable. If you
want argv expansion to be the default, just set PERL5OPT in
your default startup environment.</p>

<p>If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the
C runtimes command line wildcard expansion built into perl
binary. The resulting binary will always expand unquoted
command lines, which may not be what you want if you use a
shell that does that for you. The expansion done is also
somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested
above.</p>

<p>Win32 Specific Extensions A number of extensions
specific to the Win32 platform are available from CPAN. You
may find that many of these extensions are meant to be used
under the Activeware port of Perl, which used to be the only
native port for the Win32 platform. Since the Activeware
port does not have adequate support for Perl s extension
building tools, these extensions typically do not support
those tools either and, therefore, cannot be built using the
generic steps shown in the previous section.</p>

<p>To ensure smooth transitioning of existing code that
uses the ActiveState port, there is a bundle of Win32
extensions that contains all of the ActiveState extensions
and several other Win32 extensions from CPAN in source form,
along with many added bugfixes, and with MakeMaker support.
The latest version of this bundle is available at:</p>

<p>http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwin32/</p>

<p>See the README in that distribution for building and
installation instructions.</p>

<p>Notes on 64-bit Windows Windows .NET Server supports the
LLP64 data model on the Intel Itanium architecture.</p>

<p>The LLP64 data model is different from the LP64 data
model that is the norm on 64-bit Unix platforms. In the
former, &quot;int&quot; and &quot;long&quot; are both 32-bit
data types, while pointers are 64 bits wide. In addition,
there is a separate 64-bit wide integral type,
&quot;__int64&quot;. In contrast, the LP64 data model that
is pervasive on Unix platforms provides &quot;int&quot; as
the 32-bit type, while both the &quot;long&quot; type and
pointers are of 64-bit precision. Note that both models
provide for 64-bits of addressability.</p>

<p>64-bit Windows running on Itanium is capable of running
32-bit x86 binaries transparently. This means that you could
use a 32-bit build of Perl on a 64-bit system. Given this,
why would one want to build a 64-bit build of Perl? Here are
some reasons why you would bother:</p>

<p>&middot; A 64-bit native application will run much more
efficiently on Itanium hardware.</p>

<p>&middot; There is no 2GB limit on process size.</p>

<p>&middot; Perl automatically provides large file support
when built under 64-bit Windows.</p>

<p>&middot; Embedding Perl inside a 64-bit application.</p>

<p>Running Perl Scripts Perl scripts on UNIX use the
&quot;#!&quot; (a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to indicate
to the OS that it should execute the file using perl. Win32
has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary files are
executables.</p>

<p>Instead, all available methods to execute plain text
files on Win32 rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;. There
are three methods to use this to execute perl scripts:</p>

<p>1. There is a facility called &quot;file extension
associations&quot; that will work in Windows NT 4.0. This
can be manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot;
and &quot;ftype&quot; that come standard with Windows NT
4.0. Type &quot;ftype /?&quot; for a complete example of how
to set this up for perl scripts (Say what? You thought
Windows NT wasnt perl-ready? :).</p>

<p>2. Since file associations dont work everywhere, and
there are reportedly bugs with file associations where it
does work, the old method of wrapping the perl script to
make it look like a regular batch file to the OS, may be
used. The install process makes available the
&quot;pl2bat.bat&quot; script which can be used to wrap perl
scripts into batch files. For example:</p>

<p>pl2bat foo.pl</p>

<p>will create the file &quot;FOO.BAT&quot;. Note
&quot;pl2bat&quot; strips any .pl suffix and adds a .bat
suffix to the generated file.</p>

<p>If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note
that &quot;pl2bat&quot; uses the &quot;%*&quot; variable in
the generated batch file to refer to all the command line
arguments, so you may need to make sure that construct works
in batch files. As of this writing, 4DOS/NT users will need
a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in their 4NT.INI
file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the
4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</p>

<p>3. Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a few problems: the file
name gets changed, so scripts that rely on $0 to find what
they must do may not run properly; running
&quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the contents of the original
script, and so this process can be maintenance intensive if
the originals get updated often. A different approach that
avoids both problems is possible.</p>

<p>A script called &quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available
that can be copied to any filename (along with the .bat
suffix). For example, if you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it
will run the file &quot;foo&quot; when it is executed. Since
you can run batch files on Win32 platforms simply by typing
the name (without the extension), this effectively runs the
file &quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot;
or &quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method,
&quot;foo.bat&quot; can even be in a different location than
the file &quot;foo&quot;, as long as &quot;foo&quot; is
available somewhere on the PATH. If your scripts are on a
filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid
copying &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.</p>

<p>Here s a diversion: copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to
&quot;runperl&quot;, and type &quot;runperl&quot;. Explain
the observed behavior, or lack thereof. :) Hint: .gnidnats
llits eruoy fi ,&quot;lrepnur&quot; eteled :tniH</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Things A full set of HTML documentation is
installed, so you should be able to use it if you have a web
browser installed on your system.</p>

<p>&quot;perldoc&quot; is also a useful tool for browsing
information contained in the documentation, especially in
conjunction with a pager like &quot;less&quot; (recent
versions of which have Win32 support). You may have to set
the PAGER environment variable to use a specific pager.
&quot;perldoc -f foo&quot; will print information about the
perl operator &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>One common mistake when using this port with a GUI
library like &quot;Tk&quot; is assuming that Perl s normal
behavior of opening a command-line window will go away. This
isnt the case. If you want to start a copy of
&quot;perl&quot; without opening a command-line window, use
the &quot;wperl&quot; executable built during the
installation process. Usage is exactly the same as normal
&quot;perl&quot; on Win32, except that options like
&quot;-h&quot; dont work (since they need a command-line
window to print to).</p>

<p>If you find bugs in perl, you can run
&quot;perlbug&quot; to create a bug report (you may have to
send it manually if &quot;perlbug&quot; cannot find a mailer
on your system).</p>

<p>BUGS AND CAVEATS Norton AntiVirus interferes with the
build process, particularly if set to &quot;AutoProtect, All
Files, when Opened&quot;. Unlike large applications the perl
build process opens and modifies a lot of files. Having the
the AntiVirus scan each and every one slows build the
process significantly. Worse, with PERLIO=stdio the build
process fails with peculiar messages as the virus checker
interacts badly with miniperl.exe writing configure files
(it seems to either catch file part written and treat it as
suspicious, or virus checker may have it &quot;locked&quot;
in a way which inhibits miniperl updating it). The build
does complete with</p>

<p>set PERLIO=perlio</p>

<p>but that may be just luck. Other AntiVirus software may
have similar issues.</p>

<p>Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as
documented in perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at
all. To avoid surprises, particularly if you have had prior
exposure to Perl in other operating environments or if you
intend to write code that will be portable to other
environments, see perlport for a reasonably definitive list
of these differences.</p>

<p>Not all extensions available from CPAN may build or work
properly in the Win32 environment. See &quot;Building
Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p>Most &quot;socket()&quot; related calls are supported,
but they may not behave as on Unix platforms. See perlport
for the full list. Perl requires Winsock2 to be installed on
the system. If youre running Win95, you can download Winsock
upgrade from here:</p>


<p>http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools/S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/Default.asp</p>

<p>Later OS versions already include Winsock2 support.</p>

<p>Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms
(where it doesnt exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For
instance, calling &quot;die()&quot; or &quot;exit()&quot;
from signal handlers will cause an exception, since most
implementations of &quot;signal()&quot; on Win32 are
severely crippled. Thus, signals may work only for simple
things like setting a flag variable in the handler. Using
signals under this port should currently be considered
unsupported.</p>

solutions that you may find to &lt;perlbug@perl.org&gt;,
