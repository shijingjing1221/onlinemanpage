<p>PROBE::IOBLOCK_TRACE(3stIO)Scheduler and block IO
TPROBE::IOBLOCK_TRACE(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME probe::ioblock_trace.request - Fires just as a
generic block I/O request is created for a bio.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ioblock_trace.request</p>

<p>VALUES None</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION devname - block device name ino - i-node
number of the mapped file bytes_done - number of bytes
transferred sector - beginning sector for the entire bio
flags - see below BIO_UPTODATE 0 ok after I/O completion
BIO_RW_BLOCK 1 RW_AHEAD set, and read/write would block
BIO_EOF 2 out-out-bounds error BIO_SEG_VALID 3 nr_hw_seg
valid BIO_CLONED 4 doesn&acute;t own data BIO_BOUNCED 5 bio
is a bounce bio BIO_USER_MAPPED 6 contains user pages
BIO_EOPNOTSUPP 7 not supported</p>

<p>rw - binary trace for read/write request vcnt - bio
vector count which represents number of array element (page,
offset, length) which make up this I/O request idx - offset
into the bio vector array phys_segments - number of segments
in this bio after physical address coalescing is performed.
size - total size in bytes bdev - target block device
bdev_contains - points to the device object which contains
the partition (when bio structure represents a partition)
p_start_sect - points to the start sector of the partition
structure of the device</p>

<p>CONTEXT The process makes block I/O request</p>
