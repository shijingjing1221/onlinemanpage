<p>NAME pfm_find_event, pfm_find_full_event,
pfm_find_event_bycode, pfm_find_event_bycode_next,
pfm_find_event_mask - search for events and unit masks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pfm_find_event(const char *str, unsigned int *desc);
int pfm_find_full_event(const char *str, pfmlib_event_t *e);
int pfm_find_event_bycode(int code, unsigned int *desc); int
pfm_find_event_bycode_next(unsigned int desc1, int code,
unsigned int *desc); int pfm_find_event_mask(unsigned int
idx, const char *str, unsigned int *mask_idx);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The PMU counters can be programmed to count
the number of occurrences of certain events. The number of
events varies from one PMU model to the other. Each event
has a name and a code which is used to program the actual
PMU register. Some event may need to be further qualified
with unit masks.</p>

<p>The library does not directly expose the event code, nor
unit mask code, to user applications because it is not
necessary. Instead appli- cations use names to query the
library for particular information about events. Given an
event name, the library returns an opaque descriptor. Each
descriptor is unique and has no relationship to the event
code.</p>

<p>The set of functions described here can be used to get
an event descriptor given either the name of the event or
its code. Several events may share the same code. An event
name is a string structured as:
event_name[:unit_mask1[:unit_mask2]].</p>

<p>The pfm_find_event() function is a general purpose
search routine. Given an event name in str, it returns the
descriptor for the corre- sponding event. If unit masks are
provided, they are not taken into account. This function is
being deprecated in favor of the pfm_find_full_event()
function.</p>

<p>The pfm_find_full_event() function is the general
purpose search rou- tine. Given an event name in str, it
returns in ev, the full event descriptor that includes the
event descriptor in ev-&gt;event and the unit mask
descriptors in ev-&gt;unit_masks. The number of unit masks
descrip- tors returned is indicated in ev-&gt;num_masks.
Unit masks are specified as a colon separated list of unit
mask names, exact values or value combinations. For
instance, if event A supports unit masks M1 (0x1) and M2
(0x40), and both unit masks are to be measured, then the
follow- ing values for str are valid: &quot;A:M1:M2&quot;,
&quot;A:M1:0x40&quot;, &quot;A:M2:0x1&quot;,
&quot;A:0x1:0x40&quot;, &quot;A:0x41&quot;.</p>

<p>The pfm_find_event_bycode() function searches for an
event given its code represented as an integer. It returns
in desc, the event code. Unit masks are ignored.</p>

<p>Because there can be several events with the same code,
the library provides the pfm_find_event_bycode_next()
function to search for other events with the same code.
Given an event desc1 and a code, this func- tion will look
for the next event with the same code. If such an event
exists, its descriptor will be stored into desc. It is not
necessary to have called the pfm_find_event_bycode()
function prior to calling this function. This function is
fully threadsafe as it does not main- tain any state between
calls.</p>

<p>The pfm_find_event_mask() function is used to find the
unit mask descriptor based on its name or numerical value
passed in str for the event specified in idx. The numeric
value must be an exact match of an existing unit mask value,
i.e., all bits must match. Some events do not have unit
masks, in which case this function returns an error.</p>

<p>RETURN All functions return whether or not the call was
successful. A return value of PFMLIB_SUCCESS indicates
success, otherwise the value is the error code.</p>

<p>ERRORS PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT the library has not been
initialized properly.</p>

<p>PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL the event descriptor is invalid, or the
pointer argument is NULL.</p>

<p>PFMLIB_ERR_NOTFOUND no matching event or unit mask was
found.</p>
