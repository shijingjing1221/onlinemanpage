<p>NAME pilot-read-ical - Exports the DatebookDB and/or
ToDo applications to ical format.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-read-ical [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-?|--help] [-q|--quiet] [--usage]
[-d|--datebook] [-t|--pubtext pubtext] [-f|--file file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note, this is not the same as the iCal
calendar format.</p>

<p>pilot-read-ical allows the user to retrieve the contents
of the ToDo and Datebook databases on a Palm handheld, and
convert their contents to an Ical calendar.</p>

<p>Note that the calendar file named by filename will be
deleted, so do not use your main calendar. Instead, use a
separate one for this pur- pose, and include it in your main
calendar.</p>

<p>As pilot-read-ical works by passing a script to ical,
the ical applica- tion must be in your $PATH.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-read-ical options -d, --datebook</p>

<p>Datebook only, no ToDos</p>

<p>-t, --pubtext pubtext</p>

<p>Replace text of items not started with a bullet with
pubtext</p>

<p>-f, --file file</p>

<p>This is the file in which the ical-formatted data should
be saved. Note that this will be deleted, so do not use your
primary calendar file. See DESCRIPTION for details.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port port</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-read-ical
will look for the $PILOTPORT environ- ment variable. If
neither are found, pilot-read-ical will print the usage
information.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>Suppress Hit HotSync button message</p>

<p>-v, --version</p>

<p>Display version of pilot-read-ical and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>Display the help synopsis for pilot-read-ical and exit
without connect- ing.</p>

<p>--usage</p>

<p>Display a brief usage message and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>USAGE The program will connect to a target device,
retrieve the ToDo and Datebook databases (ToDoDB.pdb and
DatebookDB.pdb respectively), then instruct ical to write a
calendar file based on the retrieved informa- tion.</p>
