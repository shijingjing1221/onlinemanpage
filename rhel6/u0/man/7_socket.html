<p>SOCKET(7) Linux Programmer s Manual SOCKET(7)</p>

<p>NAME socket - Linux socket interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>sockfd = socket(int socket_family, int socket_type, int
protocol);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the Linux
networking socket layer user interface. The BSD compatible
sockets are the uniform interface between the user process
and the network protocol stacks in the kernel. The protocol
modules are grouped into protocol families like AF_INET,
AF_IPX, AF_PACKET and socket types like SOCK_STREAM or
SOCK_DGRAM. See socket(2) for more information on families
and types.</p>

<p>Socket Layer Functions These functions are used by the
user process to send or receive packets and to do other
socket operations. For more information see their respective
manual pages.</p>

<p>socket(2) creates a socket, connect(2) connects a socket
to a remote socket address, the bind(2) function binds a
socket to a local socket address, listen(2) tells the socket
that new connections shall be accepted, and accept(2) is
used to get a new socket with a new incoming connection.
socketpair(2) returns two connected anonymous sockets (only
implemented for a few local families like AF_UNIX)</p>

<p>send(2), sendto(2), and sendmsg(2) send data over a
socket, and recv(2), recvfrom(2), recvmsg(2) receive data
from a socket. poll(2) and select(2) wait for arriving data
or a readiness to send data. In addition, the standard I/O
operations like write(2), writev(2), send- file(2), read(2),
and readv(2) can be used to read and write data.</p>

<p>getsockname(2) returns the local socket address and
getpeername(2) returns the remote socket address.
getsockopt(2) and setsockopt(2) are used to set or get
socket layer or protocol options. ioctl(2) can be used to
set or read some other options.</p>

<p>close(2) is used to close a socket. shutdown(2) closes
parts of a full-duplex socket connection.</p>

<p>Seeking, or calling pread(2) or pwrite(2) with a
non-zero position is not supported on sockets.</p>

<p>It is possible to do non-blocking I/O on sockets by
setting the O_NON- BLOCK flag on a socket file descriptor
using fcntl(2). Then all opera- tions that would block will
(usually) return with EAGAIN (operation should be retried
later); connect(2) will return EINPROGRESS error. The user
can then wait for various events via poll(2) or
select(2).</p>


<p>+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| I/O events |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Event | Poll flag | Occurrence |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read | POLLIN | New data arrived. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read | POLLIN | A connection setup has been completed (for
| | | | connection-oriented sockets) |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read | POLLHUP | A disconnection request has been initiated
| | | | by the other end. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read | POLLHUP | A connection is broken (only for connec- |
| | | tion-oriented protocols). When the socket | | | | is
written SIGPIPE is also sent. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Write | POLLOUT | Socket has enough send buffer space for |
| | | writing new data. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read/Write | POLLIN| | An outgoing connect(2) finished. | |
| POLLOUT | |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read/Write | POLLERR | An asynchronous error occurred. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Read/Write | POLLHUP | The other end has shut down one
direction. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
|Exception | POLLPRI | Urgent data arrived. SIGURG is sent
then. |
+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>An alternative to poll(2) and select(2) is to let the
kernel inform the application about events via a SIGIO
signal. For that the O_ASYNC flag must be set on a socket
file descriptor via fcntl(2) and a valid signal handler for
SIGIO must be installed via sigaction(2). See the Signals
discussion below.</p>

<p>Socket Options These socket options can be set by using
setsockopt(2) and read with getsockopt(2) with the socket
level set to SOL_SOCKET for all sockets:</p>

<p>SO_ACCEPTCONN Returns a value indicating whether or not
this socket has been marked to accept connections with
listen(2). The value 0 indi- cates that this is not a
listening socket, the value 1 indicates that this is a
listening socket. Can only be read with getsock- opt(2).</p>

<p>SO_BINDTODEVICE Bind this socket to a particular device
like eth0 , as speci- fied in the passed interface name. If
the name is an empty string or the option length is zero,
the socket device binding is removed. The passed option is a
variable-length null-termi- nated interface name string with
the maximum size of IFNAMSIZ. If a socket is bound to an
interface, only packets received from that particular
interface are processed by the socket. Note that this only
works for some socket types, particularly AF_INET sockets.
It is not supported for packet sockets (use normal bind(8)
there).</p>

<p>SO_BROADCAST Set or get the broadcast flag. When
enabled, datagram sockets receive packets sent to a
broadcast address and they are allowed to send packets to a
broadcast address. This option has no effect on
stream-oriented sockets.</p>

<p>SO_BSDCOMPAT Enable BSD bug-to-bug compatibility. This
is used by the UDP protocol module in Linux 2.0 and 2.2. If
enabled ICMP errors received for a UDP socket will not be
passed to the user pro- gram. In later kernel versions,
support for this option has been phased out: Linux 2.4
silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates a kernel
warning (printk()) if a program uses this option. Linux 2.0
also enabled BSD bug-to-bug compatibility options (random
header changing, skipping of the broadcast flag) for raw
sockets with this option, but that was removed in Linux
2.2.</p>

<p>SO_DEBUG Enable socket debugging. Only allowed for
processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability or an effective
user ID of 0.</p>

<p>SO_ERROR Get and clear the pending socket error. Only
valid as a get- sockopt(2). Expects an integer.</p>

<p>SO_DONTROUTE Don t send via a gateway, only send to
directly connected hosts. The same effect can be achieved by
setting the MSG_DONTROUTE flag on a socket send(2)
operation. Expects an integer boolean flag.</p>

<p>SO_KEEPALIVE Enable sending of keep-alive messages on
connection-oriented sockets. Expects an integer boolean
flag.</p>

<p>SO_LINGER Sets or gets the SO_LINGER option. The
argument is a linger structure.</p>

<p>struct linger { int l_onoff; /* linger active */ int
l_linger; /* how many seconds to linger for */ };</p>

<p>When enabled, a close(2) or shutdown(2) will not return
until all queued messages for the socket have been
successfully sent or the linger timeout has been reached.
Otherwise, the call returns immediately and the closing is
done in the background. When the socket is closed as part of
exit(2), it always lingers in the background.</p>

<p>SO_OOBINLINE If this option is enabled, out-of-band data
is directly placed into the receive data stream. Otherwise
out-of-band data is only passed when the MSG_OOB flag is set
during receiving.</p>

<p>SO_PASSCRED Enable or disable the receiving of the
SCM_CREDENTIALS control message. For more information see
unix(7).</p>

<p>SO_PEERCRED Return the credentials of the foreign
process connected to this socket. This is only possible for
connected AF_UNIX stream sockets and AF_UNIX stream and
datagram socket pairs created using socketpair(2); see
unix(7). The returned credentials are those that were in
effect at the time of the call to connect(2) or
socketpair(2). Argument is a ucred structure. Only valid as
a getsockopt(2).</p>

<p>SO_PRIORITY Set the protocol-defined priority for all
packets to be sent on this socket. Linux uses this value to
order the networking queues: packets with a higher priority
may be processed first depending on the selected device
queueing discipline. For ip(7), this also sets the IP
type-of-service (TOS) field for outgoing packets. Setting a
priority outside the range 0 to 6 requires the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability.</p>

<p>SO_RCVBUF Sets or gets the maximum socket receive buffer
in bytes. The kernel doubles this value (to allow space for
bookkeeping over- head) when it is set using setsockopt(2),
and this doubled value is returned by getsockopt(2). The
default value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default
file, and the maximum allowed value is set by the
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max file. The mini- mum (doubled)
value for this option is 256.</p>

<p>SO_RCVBUFFORCE (since Linux 2.6.14) Using this socket
option, a privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) process can perform the
same task as SO_RCVBUF, but the rmem_max limit can be
overridden.</p>

<p>SO_RCVLOWAT and SO_SNDLOWAT Specify the minimum number
of bytes in the buffer until the socket layer will pass the
data to the protocol (SO_SNDLOWAT) or the user on receiving
(SO_RCVLOWAT). These two values are ini- tialized to 1.
SO_SNDLOWAT is not changeable on Linux (setsock- opt(2)
fails with the error ENOPROTOOPT). SO_RCVLOWAT is changeable
only since Linux 2.4. The select(2) and poll(2) sys- tem
calls currently do not respect the SO_RCVLOWAT setting on
Linux, and mark a socket readable when even a single byte of
data is available. A subsequent read from the socket will
block until SO_RCVLOWAT bytes are available.</p>

<p>SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO Specify the receiving or
sending timeouts until reporting an error. The argument is a
struct timeval. If an input or output function blocks for
this period of time, and data has been sent or received, the
return value of that function will be the amount of data
transferred; if no data has been transferred and the timeout
has been reached then -1 is returned with errno set to
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK just as if the socket was specified to
be non-blocking. If the timeout is set to zero (the default)
then the operation will never timeout. Timeouts only have
effect for system calls that perform socket I/O (e.g.,
read(2), recvmsg(2), send(2), sendmsg(2)); timeouts have no
effect for select(2), poll(2), epoll_wait(2), etc.</p>

<p>SO_REUSEADDR Indicates that the rules used in validating
addresses supplied in a bind(2) call should allow reuse of
local addresses. For AF_INET sockets this means that a
socket may bind, except when there is an active listening
socket bound to the address. When the listening socket is
bound to INADDR_ANY with a specific port then it is not
possible to bind to this port for any local address.
Argument is an integer boolean flag.</p>

<p>SO_SNDBUF Sets or gets the maximum socket send buffer in
bytes. The ker- nel doubles this value (to allow space for
bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using setsockopt(2),
and this doubled value is returned by getsockopt(2). The
default value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default
file and the maximum allowed value is set by the
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max file. The mini- mum (doubled)
value for this option is 2048.</p>

<p>SO_SNDBUFFORCE (since Linux 2.6.14) Using this socket
option, a privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) process can perform the
same task as SO_SNDBUF, but the wmem_max limit can be
overridden.</p>

<p>SO_TIMESTAMP Enable or disable the receiving of the
SO_TIMESTAMP control mes- sage. The timestamp control
message is sent with level SOL_SOCKET and the cmsg_data
field is a struct timeval indicat- ing the reception time of
the last packet passed to the user in this call. See cmsg(3)
for details on control messages.</p>

<p>SO_TYPE Gets the socket type as an integer (like
SOCK_STREAM). Can only be read with getsockopt(2).</p>

<p>Signals When writing onto a connection-oriented socket
that has been shut down (by the local or the remote end)
SIGPIPE is sent to the writing process and EPIPE is
returned. The signal is not sent when the write call
specified the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag.</p>

<p>When requested with the FIOSETOWN fcntl(2) or SIOCSPGRP
ioctl(2), SIGIO is sent when an I/O event occurs. It is
possible to use poll(2) or select(2) in the signal handler
to find out which socket the event occurred on. An
alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a real-time sig- nal
using the F_SETSIG fcntl(2); the handler of the real time
signal will be called with the file descriptor in the si_fd
field of its sig- info_t. See fcntl(2) for more
information.</p>

<p>Under some circumstances (e.g., multiple processes
accessing a single socket), the condition that caused the
SIGIO may have already disap- peared when the process reacts
to the signal. If this happens, the process should wait
again because Linux will resend the signal later.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces The core socket networking parameters
can be accessed via files in the directory
/proc/sys/net/core/.</p>

<p>rmem_default contains the default setting in bytes of
the socket receive buffer.</p>

<p>rmem_max contains the maximum socket receive buffer size
in bytes which a user may set by using the SO_RCVBUF socket
option.</p>

<p>wmem_default contains the default setting in bytes of
the socket send buffer.</p>

<p>wmem_max contains the maximum socket send buffer size in
bytes which a user may set by using the SO_SNDBUF socket
option.</p>

<p>message_cost and message_burst configure the token
bucket filter used to load limit warning messages caused by
external network events.</p>

<p>netdev_max_backlog Maximum number of packets in the
global input queue.</p>

<p>optmem_max Maximum length of ancillary data and user
control data like the iovecs per socket.</p>

<p>Ioctls These operations can be accessed using
ioctl(2):</p>

<p>error = ioctl(ip_socket, ioctl_type,
&amp;value_result);</p>

<p>SIOCGSTAMP Return a struct timeval with the receive
timestamp of the last packet passed to the user. This is
useful for accurate round trip time measurements. See
setitimer(2) for a description of struct timeval. This ioctl
should only be used if the socket option SO_TIMESTAMP is not
set on the socket. Otherwise, it returns the timestamp of
the last packet that was received while SO_TIMESTAMP was not
set, or it fails if no such packet has been received, (i.e.,
ioctl(2) returns -1 with errno set to ENOENT).</p>

<p>SIOCSPGRP Set the process or process group to send SIGIO
or SIGURG signals to when an asynchronous I/O operation has
finished or urgent data is available. The argument is a
pointer to a pid_t. If the argument is positive, send the
signals to that process. If the argument is negative, send
the signals to the process group with the ID of the absolute
value of the argument. The process may only choose itself or
its own process group to receive sig- nals unless it has the
CAP_KILL capability or an effective UID of 0.</p>

<p>FIOASYNC Change the O_ASYNC flag to enable or disable
asynchronous I/O mode of the socket. Asynchronous I/O mode
means that the SIGIO signal or the signal set with F_SETSIG
is raised when a new I/O event occurs.</p>

<p>Argument is an integer boolean flag. (This operation is
synony- mous with the use of fcntl(2) to set the O_ASYNC
flag.)</p>

<p>SIOCGPGRP Get the current process or process group that
receives SIGIO or SIGURG signals, or 0 when none is set.</p>

<p>Valid fcntl(2) operations:</p>

<p>FIOGETOWN The same as the SIOCGPGRP ioctl(2).</p>

<p>FIOSETOWN The same as the SIOCSPGRP ioctl(2).</p>

<p>VERSIONS SO_BINDTODEVICE was introduced in Linux 2.0.30.
SO_PASSCRED is new in Linux 2.2. The /proc interfaces was
introduced in Linux 2.2. SO_RCV- TIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO are
supported since Linux 2.3.41. Earlier, time- outs were fixed
to a protocol-specific setting, and could not be read or
written.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer
is used for internal kernel structures; thus the values in
the corresponding /proc files are twice what can be observed
on the wire.</p>

<p>Linux will only allow port re-use with the SO_REUSEADDR
option when this option was set both in the previous program
that performed a bind(2) to the port and in the program that
wants to re-use the port. This differs from some
implementations (e.g., FreeBSD) where only the later program
needs to set the SO_REUSEADDR option. Typically this
difference is invisible, since, for example, a server
program is designed to always set this option.</p>

<p>BUGS The CONFIG_FILTER socket options SO_ATTACH_FILTER
and SO_DETACH_FILTER are not documented. The suggested
interface to use them is via the libpcap library.</p>
