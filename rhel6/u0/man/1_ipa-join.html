<p>NAME ipa-join - Join a machine to an IPA realm and get a
keytab for the host service principal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-join [ -h hostname ] [ -k keytab-file ] [
-s server ] [ -w bulk-bind-password ] [ -d ] [ -q ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Joins a host to an IPA realm and retrieves a
kerberos keytab for the host service principal.</p>

<p>Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to
perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one
or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos principal.</p>

<p>The ipa-join command will create and retrieve a service
principal for host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and place it
by default into /etc/krb5.keytab. The location can be
overridden with the -k option.</p>

<p>The IPA server to contact is set in
/etc/ipa/default.conf by default and can be overridden using
the -s,--server option.</p>

<p>In order to join the machine needs to be authenticated.
This can happen in one of two ways:</p>

<p>* Authenticate using the current kerberos principal</p>

<p>* Provide a password to authenticate with</p>

<p>If a client host has already been joined to the IPA
realm the ipa-join command will fail. The host will need to
be removed from the server using ipa host-del FQDN in order
to join the client to the realm.</p>

<p>This command is normally executed by the
ipa-client-install command as part of the enrollment
process.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h,--hostname hostname The hostname of this
server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is
used.</p>

<p>-s,--server server The hostname of this server (FQDN).
By default of nodename from uname(2) is used.</p>

<p>-k,--keytab keytab-file The keytab file where to append
the new key (will be created if it does not exist). Default:
/etc/krb5.keytab</p>

<p>-w,--bindpw password The password to use if not using
kerberos to authenticate</p>

<p>-q,--quiet Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.</p>

<p>-d,--debug Debug mode.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab with
kerberos credentials.</p>

<p># kinit admin # ipa-join</p>

<p>Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab using a one-time
password.</p>

<p># ipa-join -w secret123</p>

<p>Join IPA domain and save the keytab in another
location.</p>

<p># ipa-join -k /tmp/host.keytab</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status is 0 on success, nonzero on
error.</p>
