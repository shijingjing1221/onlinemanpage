<p>NAME pamcut - cut a rectangle out of a PAM, PBM, PGM, or
PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamcut</p>

<p>[-left colnum]</p>

<p>[-right colnum]</p>

<p>[-top rownum]</p>

<p>[-bottom rownum]</p>

<p>[-width cols]</p>

<p>[-height rows]</p>

<p>[-pad]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[left top width height]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of option are acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamcut reads a PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input and
extracts the specified rectangle, and produces the same kind
of image as output.</p>

<p>There are two ways to specify the rectangle to cut:
arguments and options. Options are easier to remember and
read, more expressive, and allow you to use defaults.
Arguments were the only way available before July 2000.</p>

<p>If you use both options and arguments, the two
specifications get mixed in an unspecified way.</p>

<p>In any case, remember that you are specifying the
rectangle to keep, not the bits to discard. Otherwise, youll
be tempted to believe that -right=9 means to delete the 9
rightmost columns. (It really means keep the stuff up to
Column 9 and delete the rest).</p>

<p>To use options, just code any mixture of the -left,
-right, -top, -bot- tom, -width, and -height options. What
you don t specify defaults. Those defaults are in favor of
minimal cutting and in favor of cutting the right and bottom
edges off. It is an error to overspecify, i.e. to specify
all three of -left, -right, and -width or -top, -bottom, and
-height.</p>

<p>To use arguments, specify all four of the left, top,
width, and height arguments. left and top have the same
effect as specifying them as the argument of a -left or -top
option, respectively. width and height have the same effect
as specifying them as the argument of a -width or -height
option, respectively, where they are positive. Where they
are not positive, they have the same effect as specifying
one less than the value as the argument to a -right or
-bottom option, respectively. (E.g. width = 0 makes the cut
go all the way to the right edge). Before July 2000,
negative numbers were not allowed for width and height.</p>

<p>Input is from Standard Input if you dont specify the
input file pnm- file.</p>

<p>Output is to Standard Output.</p>

<p>pamcut works on a multi-image stream. It cuts each image
in the stream independently and produces a multi-image
stream output. Before Netpbm 10.32 (March 2006), it ignored
all but the first image in the stream.</p>

<p>If you are splitting a single image into multiple
same-size images, pamdice is faster and easier than running
pamcut multiple times.</p>

<p>pamcomp is also useful for cutting and padding an image
to a certain size. You create a background image of the
desired frame dimensions and overlay the subject image on
it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -left=colnum The column number of the leftmost
column to be in the output. Columns left of this get cut
out. If a nonnegative number, it refers to columns numbered
from 0 at the left, increasing to the right. If negative, it
refers to columns numbered -1 at the right, decreasing to
the left.</p>

<p>To delete N columns at the left edge, specify
-left=N.</p>

<p>To delete N columns at the right edge, specify
-left=--(N+1).</p>

<p>-right=colnum The column number of the rightmost column
to be in the output, numbered the same as for -left. Columns
to the right of this get cut out.</p>

<p>-top=rownum The row number of the topmost row to be in
the output. Rows above this get cut out. If a nonnegative
number it refers to rows numbered from 0 at the top,
increasing downward. If nega- tive, it refers to columns
numbered -1 at the bottom, decreasing upward.</p>

<p>To delete N rows at the top, specify -top=N.</p>

<p>To delete N rows at the bottom, specify
-bottom=-(N+1).</p>

<p>-bottom=rownum The row number of the bottom-most row to
be in the output, num- bered the same as for -top. Rows
below this get cut out.</p>

<p>-width=cols The number of columns to be in the output.
Must be positive.</p>

<p>-height=rows The number of rows to be in the output.
Must be positive.</p>

<p>-pad If the rectangle you specify is not entirely within
the input image, pamcut fails unless you also specify -pad.
In that case, it pads the output with black up to the edges
you specify. You can use this option if you need to have an
image of certain dimensions and have an image of arbitrary
dimensions.</p>

<p>pnmpad also adds borders to an image, but you specify
their width directly.</p>

<p>pamcomp does a more general form of this padding. Create
a background image of the frame dimensions and overlay the
subject image on it. You can use options to have the subject
image in the center of the frame or against any edge and
make the padding any color (the padding color is the color
of the background image).</p>

<p>-verbose Print information about the processing to
Standard Error.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamcut was derived from pnmcut in Netpbm 9.20
(May 2001). It was the first Netpbm program adapted to the
new PAM format and programming library.</p>

<p>The predecessor pnmcut was one of the oldest tools in
the Netpbm pack- age.</p>
