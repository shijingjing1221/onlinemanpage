<p>NAME git-symbolic-ref - Read and modify symbolic
refs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git symbolic-ref [-q] [-m &lt;reason&gt;]
&lt;name&gt; [&lt;ref&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given one argument, reads which branch head
the given symbolic ref refers to and outputs its path,
relative to the .git/ directory. Typically you would give
HEAD as the &lt;name&gt; argument to see which branch your
working tree is on.</p>

<p>Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref
&lt;name&gt; to point at the given branch &lt;ref&gt;.</p>

<p>A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string
that begins with ref: refs/. For example, your .git/HEAD is
a regular file whose contents is ref: refs/heads/master.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q, --quiet Do not issue an error message if the
&lt;name&gt; is not a symbolic ref but a detached HEAD;
instead exit with non-zero status silently.</p>

<p>-m Update the reflog for &lt;name&gt; with
&lt;reason&gt;. This is valid only when creating or updating
a symbolic ref.</p>

<p>NOTES In the past, .git/HEAD was a symbolic link
pointing at refs/heads/master. When we wanted to switch to
another branch, we did ln -sf refs/heads/newbranch
.git/HEAD, and when we wanted to find out which branch we
are on, we did readlink .git/HEAD. This was fine, and
internally that is what still happens by default, but on
platforms that do not have working symlinks, or that do not
have the readlink(1) command, this was a bit cumbersome. On
some platforms, ln -sf does not even work as advertised
(horrors). Therefore symbolic links are now deprecated and
symbolic refs are used by default.</p>

<p>git symbolic-ref will exit with status 0 if the contents
of the symbolic ref were printed correctly, with status 1 if
the requested name is not a symbolic ref, or 128 if another
error occurs.</p>
