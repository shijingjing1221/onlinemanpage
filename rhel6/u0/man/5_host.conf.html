<p>HOST.CONF(5) Linux System Administration
HOST.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME host.conf - resolver configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/host.conf contains
configuration information specific to the resolver library.
It should contain one configuration keyword per line,
followed by appropriate configuration information. The
keywords recognized are order, trim, multi, nospoof, spoof,
and reorder. These keywords are described below.</p>

<p>order This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be
performed. It should be followed by one or more lookup
methods, separated by commas. Valid methods are bind, hosts,
and nis.</p>

<p>trim This keyword may be listed more than once. Each
time it should be followed by a list of domains, separated
by colons (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), semicolons (&rsquo;;&rsquo;) or
commas (&rsquo;,&rsquo;), with the leading dot. When set,
the resolv+ library will automatically trim the given domain
name from the end of any hostname resolved via DNS. This is
intended for use with local hosts and domains. (Related
note: trim will not affect hostnames gathered via NIS or the
hosts file. Care should be taken to ensure that the first
host- name for each entry in the hosts file is fully
qualified or non- qualified, as appropriate for the local
installation.)</p>

<p>multi Valid values are on and off. If set to on, the
resolv+ library will return all valid addresses for a host
that appears in the /etc/hosts file, instead of only the
first. This is off by default, as it may cause a substantial
performance loss at sites with large hosts files.</p>

<p>nospoof Valid values are on and off. If set to on, the
resolv+ library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
enhance the secu- rity of rlogin and rsh. It works as
follows: after performing a host address lookup, resolv+
will perform a hostname lookup for that address. If the two
hostnames do not match, the query will fail. The default
value is off.</p>

<p>spoofalert Valid values are on and off. If this option
is set to on and the nospoof option is also set, resolv+
will log a warning of the error via the syslog facility. The
default value is off.</p>

<p>spoof Valid values are off, nowarn and warn. If this
option is set to off, spoofed addresses are permitted and no
warnings will be emitted via the syslog facility. If this
option is set to warn, resolv+ will attempt to prevent
hostname spoofing to enhance the security and log a warning
of the error via the syslog facility. If this option is set
to nowarn, the resolv+ library will attempt to prevent
hostname spoofing to enhance the security but not emit
warnings via the syslog facility. Setting this option to
anything else is equal to setting it to nowarn.</p>

<p>reorder Valid values are on and off. If set to on,
resolv+ will attempt to reorder host addresses so that local
addresses (i.e., on the same subnet) are listed first when a
gethostbyname(3) is per- formed. Reordering is done for all
lookup methods. The default value is off.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT There are six environment variables that can
be used to allow users to override the behavior which is
configured in /etc/host.conf.</p>

<p>RESOLV_HOST_CONF If set this variable points to a file
that should be read instead of /etc/host.conf.</p>

<p>RESOLV_SERV_ORDER Overrides the order command.</p>

<p>RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK Overrides the nospoof, spoofalert and
spoof commands in the same way as the spoof command is
parsed. Valid values are off, nowarn and warn.</p>

<p>RESOLV_MULTI Overrides the multi command.</p>

<p>RESOLV_REORDER Overrides the reorder command.</p>

<p>RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS A list of domains, separated by
colons (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), semicolons (&rsquo;;&rsquo;) or
commas (&rsquo;,&rsquo;), with the leading dot, which will
be added to the list of domains that should be trimmed.</p>

<p>RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS A list of domains,
separated by colons (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), semicolons
(&rsquo;;&rsquo;) or commas (&rsquo;,&rsquo;), with the
leading dot, which will replace the list of domains that
should be trimmed. Overrides the trim com- mand.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/host.conf Resolver configuration file</p>

<p>/etc/resolv.conf Resolver configuration file</p>

<p>/etc/hosts Local hosts database</p>

<p>NOTES The following differences exist compared to the
original implementa- tion. A new command spoof and a new
environment variable RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK can take arguments
like off, nowarn and warn. Line comments can appear anywhere
and not only at the beginning of a line.</p>
