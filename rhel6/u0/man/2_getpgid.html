<p>SETPGID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETPGID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setpgid, getpgid, setpgrp, getpgrp - set/get
process group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid); pid_t getpgid(pid_t
pid);</p>

<p>pid_t getpgrp(void); /* POSIX.1 version */ pid_t
getpgrp(psid_t pid); /* BSD version */</p>

<p>int setpgrp(void); /* System V version */ int
setpgrp(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid); /* BSD version */</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>getpgid(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 setpgrp() (POSIX.1):
_SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>setpgrp() (BSD), getpgrp() (BSD): _BSD_SOURCE &amp;&amp;
! (_POSIX_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED || _GNU_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All of these interfaces are available on
Linux, and are used for get- ting and setting the process
group ID (PGID) of a process. The pre- ferred,
POSIX.1-specified ways of doing this are: getpgrp(void), for
retrieving the calling processs PGID; and setpgid(), for
setting a processs PGID.</p>

<p>setpgid() sets the PGID of the process specified by pid
to pgid. If pid is zero, then the process ID of the calling
process is used. If pgid is zero, then the PGID of the
process specified by pid is made the same as its process ID.
If setpgid() is used to move a process from one process
group to another (as is done by some shells when creating
pipelines), both process groups must be part of the same
session (see setsid(2) and credentials(7)). In this case,
the pgid specifies an existing process group to be joined
and the session ID of that group must match the session ID
of the joining process.</p>

<p>The POSIX.1 version of getpgrp(), which takes no
arguments, returns the PGID of the calling process.</p>

<p>getpgid() returns the PGID of the process specified by
pid. If pid is zero, the process ID of the calling process
is used. (Retrieving the PGID of a process other than the
caller is rarely necessary, and the POSIX.1 getpgrp() is
preferred for that task.)</p>

<p>The System V-style setpgrp(), which takes no arguments,
is equivalent to setpgid(0, 0).</p>

<p>The BSD-specific setpgrp() call, which takes arguments
pid and pgid, is equivalent to setpgid(pid, pgid).</p>

<p>The BSD-specific getpgrp() call, which takes a single
pid argument, is equivalent to getpgid(pid).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, setpgid() and setpgrp() return
zero. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>The POSIX.1 getpgrp() always returns the PGID of the
caller.</p>

<p>getpgid(), and the BSD-specific getpgrp() return a
process group on success. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES An attempt was made to change the process
group ID of one of the children of the calling process and
the child had already per- formed an execve(2) (setpgid(),
setpgrp()).</p>

<p>EINVAL pgid is less than 0 (setpgid(), setpgrp()).</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to move a process into a
process group in a different session, or to change the
process group ID of one of the children of the calling
process and the child was in a dif- ferent session, or to
change the process group ID of a session leader (setpgid(),
setpgrp()).</p>

<p>ESRCH For getpgid(): pid does not match any process. For
setpgid(): pid is not the calling process and not a child of
the calling process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO setpgid() and the version of getpgrp()
with no arguments conform to POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 also specifies getpgid() and the version of
setpgrp() that takes no arguments. (POSIX.1-2008 marks this
setpgrp() specification as obsolete.)</p>

<p>The version of getpgrp() with one argument and the
version of setpgrp() that takes two arguments derive from
4.2BSD, and are not specified by POSIX.1.</p>

<p>NOTES A child created via fork(2) inherits its parents
process group ID. The PGID is preserved across an
execve(2).</p>

<p>Each process group is a member of a session and each
process is a mem- ber of the session of which its process
group is a member.</p>

<p>A session can have a controlling terminal. At any time,
one (and only one) of the process groups in the session can
be the foreground process group for the terminal; the
remaining process groups are in the back- ground. If a
signal is generated from the terminal (e.g., typing the
interrupt key to generate SIGINT), that signal is sent to
the fore- ground process group. (See termios(3) for a
description of the charac- ters that generate signals.) Only
the foreground process group may read(2) from the terminal;
if a background process group tries to read(2) from the
terminal, then the group is sent a SIGTSTP signal, which
suspends it. The tcgetpgrp(3) and tcsetpgrp(3) functions are
used to get/set the foreground process group of the
controlling termi- nal.</p>

<p>The setpgid() and getpgrp() calls are used by programs
such as bash(1) to create process groups in order to
implement shell job control.</p>

<p>If a session has a controlling terminal, and the CLOCAL
flag for that terminal is not set, and a terminal hangup
occurs, then the session leader is sent a SIGHUP. If the
session leader exits, then a SIGHUP signal will also be sent
to each process in the foreground process group of the
controlling terminal.</p>

<p>If the exit of the process causes a process group to
become orphaned, and if any member of the newly orphaned
process group is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a
SIGCONT signal will be sent to each process in the newly
orphaned process group.</p>
