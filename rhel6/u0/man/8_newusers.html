<p>NEWUSERS(8) System Management Commands NEWUSERS(8)</p>

<p>NAME newusers - update and create new users in batch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS newusers [options new_users]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The newusers command reads a file of user
name and clear-text password pairs and uses this information
to update a group of existing users or to create new users.
Each line is in the same format as the standard password
file (see passwd(5)) with the exceptions explained
below:</p>


<p>pw_name:pw_passwd:pw_uid:pw_gid:pw_gecos:pw_dir:pw_shell</p>

<p>pw_name This is the name of the user.</p>

<p>It can be the name of a new user or the name of an
existing user (or an user created before by newusers). In
case of an existing user, the user&acute;s information will
be changed, otherwise a new user will be created.</p>

<p>pw_passwd This field will be encrypted and used as the
new value of the encrypted password.</p>

<p>pw_uid This field is used to define the UID of the
user.</p>

<p>If the field is empty, an new (unused) UID will be
defined automatically by newusers.</p>

<p>If this field contains a number, this number will be
used as the UID.</p>

<p>If this field contains the name of an existing user (or
the name of an user created before by newusers), the UID of
the specified user will be used.</p>

<p>If the UID of an existing user is changed, the files
ownership of the user&acute;s file should be fixed
manually.</p>

<p>pw_gid This field is used to define the primary group ID
for the user.</p>

<p>If this field contains the name of an existing group (or
a group created before by newusers), the GID of this group
will be used as the primary group ID for the user.</p>

<p>If this field is a number, this number will be used as
the primary group ID of the user. If no groups exist with
this GID, a new group will be created with this GID, and the
name of the user.</p>

<p>If this field is empty, a new group will be created with
the name of the user and a GID will be automatically defined
by newusers to be used as the primary group ID for the user
and as the GID for the new group.</p>

<p>If this field contains the name of a group which does
not exist (and was not created earlier wbefore by newusers),
a new group will be created with the specified name and a
GID will be automatically defined by newusers to be used as
the primary group ID for the user and Gs the ID for the new
group.</p>

<p>pw_gecos This field is copied in the GECOS field of the
user.</p>

<p>pw_dir This field is used to define the home directory
of the user.</p>

<p>If this field does not specify an existing directory,
the specified directory is created, with ownership set to
the user being created or updated and its primary group.Note
that newusers does not create parent directories of the new
user s home directory. The newusers command will fail to
create the home directory if the parent directories do not
exist, and will send a message to stderr informing the user
of the failure. The newusers command will not halt or return
a failure to the calling shell if it fails to create the
home directory, it will continue to process the batch of new
users specified.</p>

<p>If the home directory of an existing user is changed,
newusers does not move or copy the content of the old
directory to the new location. This should be done
manually.</p>

<p>pw_shell This field defines the shell of the user. No
checks are performed on this field.</p>

<p>newusers first tries to create or change all the
specified users, and then write these changes to the user or
group databases. If an error occurs (except in the final
writes to the databases), no changes are committed to the
databases.</p>

<p>This command is intended to be used in a large system
environment where many accounts are updated at a single
time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the newusers command
are:</p>

<p>-c, --crypt-method Use the specified method to encrypt
the passwords.</p>

<p>The available methods are DES, MD5, NONE, and SHA256 or
SHA512 if your libc support these methods.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-r, --system Create a system account.</p>

<p>System users will be created with no aging information
in /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are choosen in
the SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in login.defs,
instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for
the creation of groups).</p>

<p>-s, --sha-rounds Use the specified number of rounds to
encrypt the passwords.</p>

<p>The value 0 means that the system will choose the
default number of rounds for the crypt method (5000).</p>

<p>A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of
999,999,999 will be enforced.</p>

<p>You can only use this option with the SHA256 or SHA512
crypt method.</p>

<p>By default, the number of rounds is defined by the
SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The input file must be protected since it
contains unencrypted passwords.</p>

<p>You should make sure the passwords and the encryption
method respect the system&acute;s password policy.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>ENCRYPT_METHOD (string) This defines the system default
encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no
algorithm are specified on the command line).</p>

<p>It can take one of these values:</p>

<p>&middot; DES (default)</p>

<p>&middot; MD5</p>

<p>&middot; SHA256</p>

<p>&middot; SHA512</p>

<p>Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB
variable.</p>

<p>GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number) Range of group IDs
used for the creation of regular groups by useradd,
groupadd, or newusers.</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean) Indicate if passwords must be
encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm. If set to yes, new
passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm
compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt
strings. Set to no if you need to copy encrypted passwords
to other systems which don&acute;t understand the new
algorithm. Default is no.</p>

<p>This variable is superceded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD
variable or by any command line option used to configure the
encryption algorithm.</p>

<p>This variable is deprecated. You should use
ENCRYPT_METHOD.</p>

<p>PASS_MAX_DAYS (number) The maximum number of days a
password may be used. If the password is older than this, a
password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be
assumed (which disables the restriction).</p>

<p>PASS_MIN_DAYS (number) The minimum number of days
allowed between password changes. Any password changes
attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not
specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the
restriction).</p>

<p>PASS_WARN_AGE (number) The number of days warning given
before a password expires. A zero means warning is given
only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no
warning is given. If not specified, no warning will be
provided.</p>

<p>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
(number) When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512,
this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption
algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not
specified on the command line).</p>

<p>With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute
forcing the password. But note also that more CPU resources
will be needed to authenticate users.</p>

<p>If not specified, the libc will choose the default
number of rounds (5000).</p>

<p>The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.</p>

<p>If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value will be
used.</p>

<p>If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS &gt; SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the
highest value will be used.</p>

<p>SYS_GID_MAX (number), SYS_GID_MIN (number) Range of
group IDs used for the creation of system groups by useradd,
groupadd, or newusers.</p>

<p>SYS_UID_MAX (number), SYS_UID_MIN (number) Range of user
IDs used for the creation of system users by useradd or
newusers.</p>

<p>UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number) Range of user IDs
used for the creation of regular users by useradd or
newusers.</p>

<p>UMASK (number) The file mode creation mask is
initialized to this value. If not specified, the mask will
be initialized to 022.</p>

<p>useradd and newusers use this mask to set the mode of
the home directory they create</p>

<p>It is also used by login to define users&acute; initial
umask. Note that this mask can be overriden by the
user&acute;s GECOS line (if QUOTAS_ENAB is set) or by the
specification of a limit with the K identifier in
limits(5).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO login.defs(5), passwd(1), useradd(8).</p>
