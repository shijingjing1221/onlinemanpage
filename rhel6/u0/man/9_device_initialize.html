DEVICE_INITIALIZE(9)</p>

<p>NAME device_initialize - init device structure.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void device_initialize(struct device *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev device.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This prepares the device for use by other
layers by initializing its fields. It is the first half of
device_register, if called by that function, though it can
also be called separately, so one may use dev&acute;s
fields. In particular, get_device/put_device may be used for
reference counting of dev after calling this function.</p>

<p>NOTE Use put_device to give up your reference instead of
freeing dev directly once you have called this function.</p>
