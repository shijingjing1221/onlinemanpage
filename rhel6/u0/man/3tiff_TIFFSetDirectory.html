<p>TIFFSetDirectory(3TIFF) TIFFSetDirectory(3TIFF)</p>

<p>NAME TIFFSetDirectory, TIFFSetSubDirectory - set the
current directory for an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int TIFFSetDirectory(TIFF *tif, tdir_t dirnum) int
TIFFSetSubDirectory(TIFF *tif, uint32 diroff)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION TIFFSetDirectory changes the current
directory and reads its contents with TIFFReadDirectory. The
parameter dirnum specifies the sub- file/directory as an
integer number, with the first directory numbered zero.</p>

<p>TIFFSetSubDirectory acts like TIFFSetDirectory, except
the directory is specified as a file offset instead of an
index; this is required for accessing subdirectories linked
through a SubIFD tag.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES On successful return 1 is returned.
Otherwise, 0 is returned if dirnum or diroff specifies a
non-existent directory, or if an error was encountered while
reading the directorys contents.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>%s: Error fetching directory count. An error was
encountered while reading the directory count field.</p>

<p>%s: Error fetching directory link. An error was
encountered while reading the link value that points to the
next directory in a file.</p>
