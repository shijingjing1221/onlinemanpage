<p>PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETTYPE(3POSIX Programmer s
ManPTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETTYPE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_gettype,
pthread_mutexattr_settype - get and set the mutex type
attribute</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_gettype(const pthread_mutexattr_t
*restrict attr, int *restrict type); int
pthread_mutexattr_settype(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr, int
type);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_gettype() and
pthread_mutexattr_settype() func- tions, respectively, shall
get and set the mutex type attribute. This attribute is set
in the type parameter to these functions. The default value
of the type attribute is PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>The type of mutex is contained in the type attribute of
the mutex attributes. Valid mutex types include:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL</p>

<p>This type of mutex does not detect deadlock. A thread
attempting to relock this mutex without first unlocking it
shall deadlock. Attempting to unlock a mutex locked by a
different thread results in undefined behavior. Attempting
to unlock an unlocked mutex results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK</p>

<p>This type of mutex provides error checking. A thread
attempting to relock this mutex without first unlocking it
shall return with an error. A thread attempting to unlock a
mutex which another thread has locked shall return with an
error. A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex shall
return with an error.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE</p>

<p>A thread attempting to relock this mutex without first
unlocking it shall succeed in locking the mutex. The
relocking deadlock which can occur with mutexes of type
PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL cannot occur with this type of mutex.
Multiple locks of this mutex shall require the same number
of unlocks to release the mutex before another thread can
acquire the mutex. A thread attempting to unlock a mutex
which another thread has locked shall return with an error.
A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex shall return
with an error.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT</p>

<p>Attempting to recursively lock a mutex of this type
results in undefined behavior. Attempting to unlock a mutex
of this type which was not locked by the calling thread
results in undefined behavior. Attempting to unlock a mutex
of this type which is not locked results in undefined
behavior. An implementation may map this mutex to one of the
other mutex types.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_mutexattr_gettype() function shall return zero and
store the value of the type attribute of attr into the
object referenced by the type parameter. Otherwise, an error
shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_mutexattr_settype() function
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_settype() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value type is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutexattr_gettype() and
pthread_mutexattr_settype() func- tions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE It is advised that an application
should not use a PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECUR- SIVE mutex with
condition variables because the implicit unlock per- formed
for a pthread_cond_timedwait() or pthread_cond_wait() may
not actually release the mutex (if it had been locked
multiple times). If this happens, no other thread can
satisfy the condition of the predi- cate.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>
