<p>RENAME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RENAME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rename - rename a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rename(const char *old, const char *new);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rename() function shall change the name
of a file. The old argument points to the pathname of the
file to be renamed. The new argument points to the new
pathname of the file.</p>

<p>If either the old or new argument names a symbolic link,
rename() shall operate on the symbolic link itself, and
shall not resolve the last component of the argument. If the
old argument and the new argument resolve to the same
existing file, rename() shall return successfully and
perform no other action.</p>

<p>If the old argument points to the pathname of a file
that is not a directory, the new argument shall not point to
the pathname of a direc- tory. If the link named by the new
argument exists, it shall be removed and old renamed to new.
In this case, a link named new shall remain visible to other
processes throughout the renaming operation and refer either
to the file referred to by new or old before the operation
began. Write access permission is required for both the
directory con- taining old and the directory containing
new.</p>

<p>If the old argument points to the pathname of a
directory, the new argument shall not point to the pathname
of a file that is not a direc- tory. If the directory named
by the new argument exists, it shall be removed and old
renamed to new. In this case, a link named new shall exist
throughout the renaming operation and shall refer either to
the directory referred to by new or old before the operation
began. If new names an existing directory, it shall be
required to be an empty direc- tory.</p>

<p>If the old argument points to a pathname of a symbolic
link, the sym- bolic link shall be renamed. If the new
argument points to a pathname of a symbolic link, the
symbolic link shall be removed.</p>

<p>The new pathname shall not contain a path prefix that
names old. Write access permission is required for the
directory containing old and the directory containing new.
If the old argument points to the pathname of a directory,
write access permission may be required for the direc- tory
named by old, and, if it exists, the directory named by
new.</p>

<p>If the link named by the new argument exists and the
files link count becomes 0 when it is removed and no process
has the file open, the space occupied by the file shall be
freed and the file shall no longer be accessible. If one or
more processes have the file open when the last link is
removed, the link shall be removed before rename() returns,
but the removal of the file contents shall be postponed
until all references to the file are closed.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, rename() shall mark for
update the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the parent
directory of each file.</p>

<p>If the rename() function fails for any reason other than
[EIO], any file named by new shall be unaffected.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, rename() shall
return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned, errno shall be
set to indicate the error, and neither the file named by old
nor the file named by new shall be changed or created.</p>

<p>ERRORS The rename() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of either path prefix denies search
permission; or one of the directories containing old or new
denies write per- missions; or, write permission is required
and is denied for a directory pointed to by the old or new
arguments.</p>

<p>EBUSY The directory named by old or new is currently in
use by the system or another process, and the implementation
considers this an error.</p>

<p>EEXIST or ENOTEMPTY</p>

<p>The link named by new is a directory that is not an
empty direc- tory.</p>

<p>EINVAL The new directory pathname contains a path prefix
that names the old directory.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EISDIR The new argument points to a directory and the
old argument points to a file that is not a directory.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>EMLINK The file named by old is a directory, and the
link count of the parent directory of new would exceed
{LINK_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG</p>

<p>The length of the old or new argument exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT The link named by old does not name an existing
file, or either old or new points to an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory that would contain new cannot be
extended.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of either path prefix is not a
directory; or the old argument names a directory and new
argument names a non-direc- tory file.</p>

<p>EPERM or EACCES</p>

<p>The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing the
file referred to by old and the caller is not the file
owner, nor is the caller the directory owner, nor does the
caller have appro- priate privileges; or new refers to an
existing file, the S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory
containing this file, and the caller is not the file owner,
nor is the caller the directory owner, nor does the caller
have appropriate privi- leges.</p>

<p>EROFS The requested operation requires writing in a
directory on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>EXDEV The links named by new and old are on different
file systems and the implementation does not support links
between file systems.</p>

<p>The rename() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The file named by the old or new arguments is a
named STREAM.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG</p>

<p>As a result of encountering a symbolic link in
resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY The file to be renamed is a pure procedure
(shared text) file that is being executed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Renaming a File The following example shows how
to rename a file named /home/cnd/mod1 to /home/cnd/mod2.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int status; ... status =
rename(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;,
&quot;/home/cnd/mod2&quot;);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Some implementations mark for update
the st_ctime field of renamed files and some do not.
Applications which make use of the st_ctime field may behave
differently with respect to renamed files unless they are
designed to allow for either behavior.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This rename() function is equivalent for
regular files to that defined by the ISO C standard. Its
inclusion here expands that definition to include actions on
directories and specifies behavior when the new parameter
names a file that already exists. That specification
requires that the action of the function be atomic.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for introducing this function was to
have a means of renaming directories while permitting
implementations to prohibit the use of link() and unlink()
with directories, thus constraining links to directories to
those made by mkdir().</p>

<p>The specification that if old and new refer to the same
file is intended to guarantee that:</p>

<p>rename(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;);</p>

<p>does not remove the file.</p>

<p>Renaming dot or dot-dot is prohibited in order to
prevent cyclical file system paths.</p>

<p>See also the descriptions of [ENOTEMPTY] and
[ENAMETOOLONG] in rmdir() and [EBUSY] in unlink(). For a
discussion of [EXDEV], see link() .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
