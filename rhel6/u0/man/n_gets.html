<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME gets - Read a line from a channel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gets channelId ?varName?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command reads the next line from
channelId, returns everything in the line up to (but not
including) the end-of-line character(s), and discards the
end-of-line character(s).</p>

<p>ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such
as the Tcl standard input channel (stdin), the return value
from an invocation of open or socket, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The
channel must have been opened for input.</p>

<p>If varName is omitted the line is returned as the result
of the com- mand. If varName is specified then the line is
placed in the variable by that name and the return value is
a count of the number of charac- ters returned.</p>

<p>If end of file occurs while scanning for an end of line,
the command returns whatever input is available up to the
end of file. If chan- nelId is in nonblocking mode and there
is not a full line of input available, the command returns
an empty string and does not consume any input. If varName
is specified and an empty string is returned in var- Name
because of end-of-file or because of insufficient data in
non- blocking mode, then the return count is -1. Note that
if varName is not specified then the end-of-file and
no-full-line-available cases can produce the same results as
if there were an input line consisting only of the
end-of-line character(s). The eof and fblocked commands can
be used to distinguish these three cases.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example reads a file one line at a time and
prints it out with the current line number attached to the
start of each line.</p>

<p>set chan [open &quot;some.file.txt&quot;] set lineNumber
0 while {[gets $chan line] &gt;= 0} { puts &quot;[incr
lineNumber]: $line&quot; } close $chan</p>
