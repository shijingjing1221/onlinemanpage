<p>NAME intel - Intel integrated graphics chipsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;intel&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION intel is an Xorg driver for Intel integrated
graphics chipsets. The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and
24. All visual types are sup- ported in depth 8. For the
i810/i815 other depths support the True- Color and
DirectColor visuals. For the i830M and later, only the True-
Color visual is supported for depths greater than 8. The
driver sup- ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the
i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE intel supports the i810, i810-DC100,
i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM,
945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q, 946GZ, 965GM, 945GME, G33, Q33,
Q35, G35, GM45, G45, Q45, G43, G41 chipsets, and Pineview-M
in Atom N400 series, Pineview-D in Atom D400/D500
series.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The Intel 8xx and 9xx families of integrated graphics
chipsets have a unified memory architecture meaning that
system memory is used as video RAM. For the i810 and i815
family of chipsets, operating system sup- port for
allocating system memory is required in order to use this
driver. For the 830M and later, this is required in order
for the driver to use more video RAM than has been
pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS. This is usually
achieved with an &quot;agpgart&quot; or &quot;agp&quot; ker-
nel driver. Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris
have such kernel drivers available.</p>

<p>By default, the i810/i815 will use 8 MB of system memory
for graphics if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16 MB
if &lt; 192 MB or 24 MB if higher. Use the VideoRam option
to change the default value.</p>

<p>For the 830M and later, the driver will automatically
size its memory allocation according to the features it will
support. Therefore, the VideoRam option, which in the past
had been necessary to allow more than some small amount of
memory to be allocated, is now ignored.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
key.</p>

<p>Default: undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DRI support.</p>

<p>Default: DRI is enabled for configurations where it is
sup- ported.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the i810
and i815 chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;CacheLines&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory used
for 2D acceleration and video when XAA acceleration is
enabled. Decreasing this amount leaves more for 3D textures.
Increasing it can improve 2D performance at the expense of
3D performance.</p>

<p>Default: depends on the resolution, depth, and available
video memory. The driver attempts to allocate space for at 3
screen- fuls of pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV video. The
default used for a specific configuration can be found by
examining the Xorg log file.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DDC support.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable or
disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Default: 8-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMCSurfaces&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option enables XvMC. The integer parameter specifies the
number of surfaces to use. Valid values are 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Default: XvMC is disabled.</p>

<p>VideoRam integer This option specifies the amount of
system memory to use for graphics, in KB.</p>

<p>The default is 8192 if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128
MB, 16384 if &lt; 192 MB, 24576 if higher. DRI require at
least a value of 16384. Higher values may give better 3D
performance, at expense of available system memory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration.</p>

<p>Default: acceleration is enabled.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the 830M
and later chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This is
the same as the &quot;ColorKey&quot; option described above.
It is provided for compatibility with most other
drivers.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvPreferOverlay&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Make hardware overlay be the first XV adaptor. The overlay
behaves incorrectly in the presence of compositing, but some
prefer it due to it syncing to vblank in the absence of com-
positing. While most XV-using applications have options to
select which XV adaptor to use, this option can be used to
place the overlay first for applications which dont have
options for selecting adaptors.</p>

<p>Default: Textured video adaptor is preferred.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FallbackDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable printing of debugging information on acceleration
fall- backs to the server log.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugFlushBatches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Flush the batch buffer after every single operation.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugFlushCaches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Include an MI_FLUSH at the end of every batch buffer to
force data to be flushed out of cache and into memory before
the com- pletion of the batch.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Wait
for the completion of every batch buffer before continuing,
i.e. perform synchronous rendering.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;SwapbuffersWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers and
glXCopy- SubBufferMESA calls by GL applications. If enabled,
the calls will avoid tearing by making sure the display
scanline is out- side of the area to be copied before the
copy occurs. If dis- abled, no scanline synchronization is
performed, meaning tearing will likely occur. Note that when
enabled, this option can adversely affect the framerate of
applications that render frames at less than refresh
rate.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Tiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls whether memory buffers are allocated in
tiled mode. In most cases (especially for complex
rendering), tiling dramatically improves performance.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable XvMC
driver. Current support MPEG2 MC on 915/945 and G33 series.
User should provide absolute path to libIntelXvMC.so in
XvMCConfig file.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled.</p>

<p>OUTPUT CONFIGURATION On 830M and better chipsets, the
driver supports runtime configuration of detected outputs.
You can use the xrandr tool to control outputs on the
command line as follows:</p>

<p>xrandr --output output --set property value</p>

<p>Note that you may need to quote property and value
arguments that con- tain spaces. Each output listed below
may have one or more properties associated with it (like a
binary EDID block if one is found). Some outputs have unique
properties which are described below. See the
&quot;MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS&quot; section below for
additional information.</p>

<p>VGA VGA output port (typically exposed via an HD15
connector).</p>

<p>LVDS Low Voltage Differential Signalling output
(typically a laptop LCD panel). Available properties:</p>

<p>BACKLIGHT - current backlight level (adjustable)</p>

<p>By adjusting the BACKLIGHT property, the brightness on
the LVDS output can be adjusted. In some cases, this
property may be unavailable (for example if your platform
uses an external microcontroller to control the
backlight).</p>

<p>scaling mode - control LCD panel scaling mode</p>

<p>When the currently selected display mode differs from
the native panel resolution, various scaling options are
available. These include</p>

<p>Center</p>

<p>Simply center the image on-screen without scaling. This
is the only scaling mode that guarantees a one-to-one
correspondence between native and displayed pixels, but some
portions of the panel may be unused (so-called
&quot;letterboxing&quot;).</p>

<p>Full aspect</p>

<p>Scale the image as much as possible while preserving
aspect ratio. Pixels may not be displayed one-to-one (there
may be some blurri- ness). Some portions of the panel may be
unused if the aspect ratio of the selected mode does not
match that of the panel.</p>

<p>Full</p>

<p>Scale the image to the panel size without regard to
aspect ratio. This is the only mode which guarantees that
every pixel of the panel will be used. But the displayed
image may be distorted by stretching either horizontally or
vertically, and pixels may not be displayed one-to-one
(there may be some blurriness).</p>

<p>The precise names of these options may differ depending
on the kernel video driver, (but the functionality should be
similar). See the output of xrandr --prop for a list of
currently available scaling modes.</p>

<p>TV Integrated TV output. Available properties
include:</p>

<p>BOTTOM, RIGHT, TOP, LEFT - margins</p>

<p>Adjusting these properties allows you to control the
placement of your TV output buffer on the screen. The
options with the same name can also be set in xorg.conf with
integer value.</p>

<p>BRIGHTNESS - TV brightness, range 0-255</p>

<p>Adjust TV brightness, default value is 128.</p>

<p>CONTRAST - TV contrast, range 0-255</p>

<p>Adjust TV contrast, default value is 1.0 in chipset
specific format.</p>

<p>SATURATION - TV saturation, range 0-255</p>

<p>Adjust TV saturation, default value is 1.0 in chipset
specific format.</p>

<p>HUE - TV hue, range 0-255</p>

<p>Adjust TV hue, default value is 0.</p>

<p>TV_FORMAT - output standard</p>

<p>This property allows you to control the output standard
used on your TV output port. You can select between NTSC-M,
NTSC-443, NTSC-J, PAL-M, PAL-N, and PAL.</p>

<p>TV_Connector - connector type</p>

<p>This config option should be added to xorg.conf TV
monitors section, it allows you to force the TV output
connector type, which bypass load detect and TV will always
be taken as connected. You can select between S-Video,
Composite and Component.</p>

<p>TMDS-1 First DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>TMDS-2 Second DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>TMDS-1 , TMDS-2 , HDMI-1 , HDMI-2 DVI/HDMI outputs.
Avaliable common properties include:</p>

<p>BROADCAST_RGB - method used to set RGB color range(full
range 0-255, not full range 16-235)</p>

<p>Adjusting this propertie allows you to set RGB color
range on each channel in order to match HDTV
requirment(default 0 for full range). Setting 1 means RGB
color range is 16-235, 0 means RGB color range is 0-255 on
each channel.</p>

<p>SDVO and DVO TV outputs are not supported by the driver
at this time.</p>

<p>See xorg.conf(5) for information on associating Monitor
sections with these outputs for configuration. Associating
Monitor sections with each output can be helpful if you need
to ignore a specific output, for example, or statically
configure an extended desktop monitor layout.</p>

<p>MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS The number of independent
outputs is dictated by the number of CRTCs (in X parlance) a
given chip supports. Most recent Intel chips have two CRTCs,
meaning that two separate framebuffers can be displayed
simultaneously, in an extended desktop configuration. If a
chip sup- ports more outputs than it has CRTCs (say local
flat panel, VGA and TV in the case of many outputs), two of
the outputs will have to be &quot;cloned&quot;, meaning that
they display the same framebuffer contents (or one displays
a subset of anothers framebuffer if the modes arent
equal).</p>

<p>You can use the &quot;xrandr&quot; tool, or various
desktop utilities, to change your output configuration at
runtime. To statically configure your outputs, you can use
the &quot;Monitor-&lt;type&gt;&quot; options along with
additional monitor sections in your xorg.conf to create your
screen topology. The example below puts the VGA output to
the right of the builtin laptop screen, both running at
1024x768.</p>

<p>TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES The driver supports the
following X11 Xv attributes for Textured Video. You can use
the &quot;xvattr&quot; tool to query/set those attributes at
runtime.</p>

<p>XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is used to control
whether textured adapter synchro- nizes the screen update to
the vblank to eliminate tearing. It is a Boolean attribute
with values of 0 (never sync) or 1 (always sync). An
historic value of -1 (sync for large windows only) will now
be inter- preted as 1, (since the current approach for sync
is not costly even with small video windows).</p>
