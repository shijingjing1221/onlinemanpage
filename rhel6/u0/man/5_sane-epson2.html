<p>sane-epson2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-epson2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-epson2 - SANE backend for EPSON scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-epson2 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Epson flatbed scanners. This library supports a similar set
of scanners as the sane-epson driver but was developed to
support a wider range of connections to the scanner; include
network access.</p>

<p>Because sane-epson and sane-epson2 drivers support many
of the same devices, if one driver gives you problems you
may try disabling it to try the other. This can be done by
removing the driver name from the dll.conf or perhaps by
commenting out the options in epson.conf or epson2.conf.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend:</p>

Please send mail to the sane-backend mailing list to report
success with scanners not on the list or problems with
scanners that are listed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options the backend supports can either be
selected through command line options to programs like
scanimage or through GUI elements in pro- grams like
xscanimage or xsane.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d epson2 Not all devices
support all options.</p>

<p>Scan Mode The --mode switch selects the basic mode of
operation of the scanner. Valid choices are Binary, Gray and
Color. The Binary mode is black and white only, Gray will
produce 256 levels of gray or more depending on the scanner
and Color means 24 bit color mode or more depending on the
scanner. Some scanners will internally use 36 bit color,
their external interface however may only support 24
bits.</p>

<p>The --depth option selects the bit depth the scanner is
using. This option is only available for scanners that
support more than one bit depth. Older scanners will always
transfer the image in 8bit mode. Newer scanners allow to
select either 8 bits, 12 or 14 bits per color channel. For a
color scan this means an effective color depth of 36 or 42
bits over all three channels. The valid choices depend on
the scanner model.</p>

<p>The --halftoning switch selects the mode that is used in
Binary mode. Valid options are &quot;None&quot;,
&quot;Halftone A (Hard Tone)&quot;, &quot;Halftone B (Soft
Tone)&quot;, &quot;Halftone C (Net Screen)&quot;,
&quot;Dither A (4x4 Bayer)&quot;, &quot;Dither B (4x4
Spiral)&quot;, &quot;Dither C (4x4 Net Screen)&quot;,
&quot;Dither D (8x4 Net Screen)&quot;, &quot;Text Enhanced
Technol- ogy&quot;, &quot;Download pattern A&quot;, and
&quot;Download pattern B&quot;.</p>

<p>The --dropout switch selects the so called dropout
color. Vald options are None, Red, Green and Blue. The
default is None. The dropout color is used for monochrome
scanning and selects the color that is not scanned. This can
be used to e.g. scan an original with a colored
background.</p>

<p>The --brightness switch controls the brightness of the
scan. Valid options are integer values from -3 to 3. The
default is 0. The larger the brightness value, the brighter
the image gets. If a user defined table for the gamma
correction is selected, the brightness parameter is not
available.</p>

<p>The --sharpness switch sets the sharpness of the image
data. Valid options are integer values from -2 to 2, with -2
meaning &quot;Defocus&quot;, -1 &quot;Defocus
slightly&quot;, 0 &quot;Normal&quot;, 1 &quot;Sharpen
slightly&quot; and 2 &quot;Sharpen&quot;.</p>

<p>The --gamma-correction switch controls the scanners
internal gamma correction. Valid options are
&quot;Default&quot;, &quot;User defined&quot;, &quot;High
density printing&quot; &quot;Low density printing&quot; and
&quot;High con- trast printing&quot;.</p>

<p>The --color-correction switch controls the scanners
internal color correction function. Valid options are
&quot;No Correction&quot;, &quot;Impact-dot printers&quot;,
&quot;Thermal printers&quot;, &quot;Ink-jet printers&quot;
and &quot;CRT monitors&quot;. The default is &quot;CRT
monitors&quot;.</p>

<p>The --resolution switch selects the resolution for a
scan. Some EPSON scanners will scan in any resolution
between the lowest and highest possible value. The list
reported by the scanner can be displayed using the
&quot;--help -d epson&quot; parameters to scanim- age.</p>

<p>The --threshold switch selects the minimum brightness to
get a white point.</p>

<p>The --mirror option controls the way the image is
scanned. By reading the image data from right to left the
image is mirrored. Valid options are &quot;yes&quot; and
&quot;no&quot;. The default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>The --auto-area-segmentation switch activates the
automatic area segmentation for monochrome scans. The
scanner will try to determine which areas are text and which
contain images. The image areas will be halftoned, and the
text will be improved. Valid options are &quot;yes&quot; and
&quot;no&quot;. The default is &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>The --red-gamma-table parameter can be used to download
a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The valid
options are the same as for --gamma-table.</p>

<p>The --green-gamma-table parameter can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the green channel.
The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.</p>

<p>The --blue-gamma-table parameter can be used to download
a user defined gamma table for the blue channel. The valid
options are the same as for --gamma-table.</p>

<p>The --wait-for-button parameter can be used to wait
until the button on the scanner is pressed to actually start
the scan pro- cess.</p>

<p>The color correction coefficients --cct-1 --cct-2
--cct-3 ... --cct-9 will install color correction
coefficients for the user defined color correction. Values
are specified as integers in the range -127..127.</p>

<p>The --preview option requests a preview scan. The
frontend soft- ware automatically selects a low resolution.
Valid options are &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. The
default is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>The geometry options -l -t -x -y control the scan area:
-l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the top left y
coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of the
scan area. All param- eters are specified in
millimeters.</p>

<p>The --source option selects the scan source. Valid
options depend on the installed options. The default is
&quot;Flatbed&quot;.</p>

<p>The --auto-eject option will eject a page after scanning
from the document feeder.</p>

<p>The --film-type option will select the film type for
scans with the transparency unit. This option is only
activated if the TPU is selected as scan source. Valid
options are &quot;Negative Film&quot; and &quot;Positive
Film&quot;.</p>

<p>The --focus-position option selects the focus position
for all scans. Valid options are &quot;Focus 2.5mm above
glass&quot; and &quot;Focus on glass&quot;. The focus on the
2.5mm point above the glass is neces- sary for scans with
the transparency unit, so that the scanner can focus on the
film if one of the film holders is used. This option is only
functional for selected scanners, all other scan- ners will
ignore this option.</p>

<p>The --bay option selects which bay to scan</p>

<p>The --eject option ejects the sheet in the ADF.</p>

<p>The --adf-mode option selecst the ADF mode
(simplex/duplex).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/epson2.conf specifies the device(s) that the
backend will use. Possible connection types are:</p>

<p>SCSI This is the default, and if nothing else is
specified the back- end software will open a given path as
SCSI device. More infor- mation about valid syntax for SCSI
devices can be found in sane-scsi(5). Usually SCSI scanners
are configured with a line &quot;scsi EPSON&quot; in this
file. In some cases it may be necessary to only use the
string &quot;scsi&quot; (e.g. for the GT-6500).</p>

<p>PIO - Parallel Interface The parallel interface can be
configured in two ways: An integer value starting at the
beginning of a line will be interpreted as the IO address of
the parallel port. To make it clearer that a configured IO
address is a parallel port the port address can be preceded
by the string &quot;PIO&quot;. The PIO connection does not
use a special device file in the /dev directory. The IO
address can be specified in hex mode (prefixed with
&quot;0x&quot;).</p>

<p>USB For USB scanners not automatically detect, their
VENDOR and PRODUCT ID can be specified manually in the
config file. More information about valid syntax for USB
devices can be found in sane-usb(5).</p>

<p>Network Network scanners can be auto-discovered if
autodiscovery is specified after net keyword. An IP address
to connect to can also be used.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-epson2.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-epson2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2_SCSI If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the SCSI related debug level for this backend. Only a value
of 2 is supported.</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2_NET If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the network related debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug out- put to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>SANE_EPSON2_CMD_LVL This allows to override the function
or command level that the backend uses to communicate with
the scanner. The function level a scanner supports is
determined during the initialization of the device. If the
backend does not recognize the function level reported by
the scanner it will default to function level B3. Valid
function levels are A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8,
D1 and F5. Use this feature only if you know what you are
doing!</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sane-scsi(5), sane-usb(5), scanimage(1),
xscanimage(1), xsane(1)</p>

<p>BUGS None :-) At least none are currently known.</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED DEVICES The backend may be used with Epson
scanners that are not yet listed under the list of supported
devices. A scanner that is not recognized may default to the
function level B3, which means that not all func- tions that
the scanner may be capable of are accessible.</p>

<p>If the scanner is not even recognized as an Epson
scanner this is prob- ably because the device name reported
by the scanner is not in the cor- rect format. Please send
this information to the backend maintainer (email address is
in the AUTHOR section of this man page or in the AUTHORS
file of the SANE distribution).</p>

<p>AUTHOR The package is written by Alessandro Zummo and is
based on previous work done by Karl Hienz Kremer in the
epson package as well as based on work by Christian Bucher
and Kazuhiro Sasayama</p>
