<p>ACL_FROM_TEXT(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_FROM_TEXT(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_to_text - convert an ACL to text</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * acl_to_text(acl_t acl, ssize_t *len_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_to_text() function translates the
ACL pointed to by the argument acl into a NULL terminated
character string. If the pointer len_p is not NULL, then the
function returns the length of the string (not including the
NULL terminator) in the location pointed to by len_p. The
format of the text string returned by acl_to_text() is the
long text form defined in acl(5). The ACL referred to by acl
is not changed.</p>

<p>This function allocates any memory necessary to contain
the string and returns a pointer to the string. The caller
should free any releasable memory, when the new string is no
longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the (void*)char
returned by acl_to_text() as an argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, this function returns a pointer
to the long text form of the ACL. On error, a value of (char
*)NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_to_text() function returns a value of (char *)NULL and
sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an
ACL.</p>

<p>The ACL referenced by acl contains one or more improp-
erly formed ACL entries, or for some other reason can- not
be translated into a text form of an ACL.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The character string to be returned requires
more mem- ory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.</p>

abandoned)</p>
