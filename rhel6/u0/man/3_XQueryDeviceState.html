<p>XQUERYDEVICESTATE(3) [FIXME: manual]
XQUERYDEVICESTATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME XQueryDeviceState - query the state of an extension
input device.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>XDeviceState* XQueryDeviceState( Display *display,
XDevice *device);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device whose state is to be
queried.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XQueryDeviceState request queries the
state of an input device. The current state of keys and
buttons (up or down), and valuators (current value) on the
device is reported by this request. Each key or button is
represented by a bit in the XDeviceState structure that is
returned. Valuators on the device report 0 if they are
reporting relative information, and the current value if
they are reporting absolute information.</p>

<p>XQueryDeviceState can generate a BadDevice error.</p>

<p>Structures:</p>

<p>The XDeviceState structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { XID device_id; int num_classes;
XInputClass *data; } XDeviceState;</p>

<p>The XValuatorState structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned char class; unsigned char
length; unsigned char num_valuators; unsigned char mode; int
*valuators; } XValuatorState;</p>

<p>The XKeyState structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned char class; unsigned char
length; short num_keys; char keys[32]; } XKeyState;</p>

<p>The XButtonState structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned char class; unsigned char
length; short num_buttons; char buttons[32]; }
XButtonState;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if some other client has caused the specified device
to become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.</p>
