<p>PTHREAD_SELF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SELF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_self - get the calling thread ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>pthread_t pthread_self(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_self() function shall return the
thread ID of the calling thread.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The pthread_self() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pthread_self() function provides a
capability similar to the get- pid() function for processes
and the rationale is the same: the cre- ation call does not
provide the thread ID to the created thread.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
