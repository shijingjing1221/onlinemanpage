<p>CAPINFOS(1) The Wireshark Network Analyzer
CAPINFOS(1)</p>

<p>NAME capinfos - Prints information about capture
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS capinfos [ -t ] [ -E ] [ -c ] [ -s ] [ -d ] [
-u ] [ -a ] [ -e ] [ -y ] [ -i ] [ -z ] [ -x ] [ -h ]
&lt;infile&gt; ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Capinfos is a program that reads one or more
capture files and returns some or all available statistics
of each &lt;infile&gt;.</p>

<p>The user specifies which statistics to report by
specifying flags corresponding to the statistic. If no flags
are specified, Capinfos will report all statistics
available.</p>

<p>Capinfos is able to detect and read the same capture
files that are supported by Wireshark. The input files dont
need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
wireshark(1) or
&lt;http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html&gt;
is a detailed description of the way Wireshark handles this,
which is the same way Capinfos handles this.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -t Displays the capture type of the capture
file.</p>

<p>-E Displays the per-file encapsulation of the capture
file.</p>

<p>-c Counts the number of packets in the capture file.</p>

<p>-s Displays the size of the file, in bytes. This reports
the size of the capture file itself.</p>

<p>-d Displays the total length of all packets in the file,
in bytes. This counts the size of the packets as they
appeared in their original form, not as they appear in this
file. For example, if a packet was originally 1514 bytes and
only 256 of those bytes were saved to the capture file (if
packets were captured with a snaplen or other slicing
option), Capinfos will consider the packet to have been 1514
bytes.</p>

<p>-u Displays the capture duration, in seconds. This is
the difference in time between the earliest packet seen and
latest packet seen.</p>

<p>-a Displays the start time of the capture. Capinfos
considers the earliest timestamp seen to be the start time,
so the first packet in the capture is not necessarily the
earliest - if packets exist &quot;out-of-order&quot;,
time-wise, in the capture, Capinfos detects this.</p>

<p>-e Displays the end time of the capture. Capinfos
considers the latest timestamp seen to be the end time, so
the last packet in the capture is not necessarily the latest
- if packets exist &quot;out-of- order&quot;, time-wise, in
the capture, Capinfos detects this.</p>

<p>-y Displays the average data rate, in bytes/sec</p>

<p>-i Displays the average data rate, in bits/sec</p>

<p>-z displays the average packet size, in bytes</p>

<p>-x displays the average packet rate, in packets/sec</p>

<p>-h Prints the help listing and exits.</p>

editcap(1), tshark(1), dumpcap(1)</p>
