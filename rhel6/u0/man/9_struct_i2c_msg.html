<p>STRUCT I2C_MSG(9) I2C and SMBus Subsystem STRUCT
I2C_MSG(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_i2c_msg - an I2C transaction segment
beginning with START</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct i2c_msg { __u16 addr; __u16 flags;
#define I2C_M_TEN 0x0010 #define I2C_M_RD 0x0001 #define
I2C_M_NOSTART 0x4000 #define I2C_M_REV_DIR_ADDR 0x2000
#define I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK 0x1000 #define I2C_M_NO_RD_ACK
0x0800 #define I2C_M_RECV_LEN 0x0400 __u16 len; __u8 * buf;
};</p>

<p>MEMBERS addr Slave address, either seven or ten bits.
When this is a ten bit address, I2C_M_TEN must be set in
flags and the adapter must support I2C_FUNC_10BIT_ADDR.</p>

<p>flags I2C_M_RD is handled by all adapters. No other
flags may be provided unless the adapter exported the
relevant I2C_FUNC_* flags through
i2c_check_functionality.</p>

<p>len Number of data bytes in buf being read from or
written to the I2C slave address. For read transactions
where I2C_M_RECV_LEN is set, the caller guarantees that this
buffer can hold up to 32 bytes in addition to the initial
length byte sent by the slave (plus, if used, the SMBus
PEC); and this value will be incremented by the number of
block data bytes received.</p>

<p>buf The buffer into which data is read, or from which
it&acute;s written.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An i2c_msg is the low level representation
of one segment of an I2C transaction. It is visible to
drivers in the i2c_transfer() procedure, to userspace from
i2c-dev, and to I2C adapter drivers through the
i2c_adapter.master_xfer() method.</p>

<p>Except when I2C protocol mangling is used, all I2C
adapters implement the standard rules for I2C transactions.
Each transaction begins with a START. That is followed by
the slave address, and a bit encoding read versus write.
Then follow all the data bytes, possibly including a byte
with SMBus PEC. The transfer terminates with a NAK, or when
all those bytes have been transferred and ACKed. If this is
the last message in a group, it is followed by a STOP.
Otherwise it is followed by the next i2c_msg transaction
segment, beginning with a (repeated) START.</p>

<p>Alternatively, when the adapter supports
I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING then passing certain flags may
have changed those standard protocol behaviors. Those flags
are only for use with broken/nonconforming slaves, and with
adapters which are known to support the specific mangling
options they need (one or more of IGNORE_NAK, NO_RD_ACK,
NOSTART, and REV_DIR_ADDR).</p>
