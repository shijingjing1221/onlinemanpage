<p>NAME git-am - Apply a series of patches from a
mailbox</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git am [--signoff] [--keep] [--keep-cr |
--no-keep-cr] [--utf8 | --no-utf8] [--3way] [--interactive]
[--committer-date-is-author-date] [--ignore-date]
[--ignore-space-change | --ignore-whitespace]
[--whitespace=&lt;option&gt;] [-C&lt;n&gt;] [-p&lt;n&gt;]
[--directory=&lt;dir&gt;] [--reject] [-q | --quiet]
[--scissors | --no-scissors] [&lt;mbox&gt; |
&lt;Maildir&gt;...] git am (--continue | --skip |
--abort)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Splits mail messages in a mailbox into
commit log message, authorship information and patches, and
applies them to the current branch.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;mbox&gt;|&lt;Maildir&gt;... The list of
mailbox files to read patches from. If you do not supply
this argument, the command reads from the standard input. If
you supply directories, they will be treated as
Maildirs.</p>

<p>-s, --signoff Add a Signed-off-by: line to the commit
message, using the committer identity of yourself.</p>

<p>-k, --keep Pass -k flag to git mailinfo (see
git-mailinfo(1)).</p>

<p>--keep-cr, --no-keep-cr With --keep-cr, call git
mailsplit (see git-mailsplit(1)) with the same option, to
prevent it from stripping CR at the end of lines. am.keepcr
configuration variable can be used to specify the default
behaviour. --no-keep-cr is useful to override am.keepcr.</p>

<p>-c, --scissors Remove everything in body before a
scissors line (see git- mailinfo(1)).</p>

<p>--no-scissors Ignore scissors lines (see
git-mailinfo(1)).</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Be quiet. Only print error messages.</p>

<p>-u, --utf8 Pass -u flag to git mailinfo (see
git-mailinfo(1)). The proposed commit log message taken from
the e-mail is re-coded into UTF-8 encoding (configuration
variable i18n.commitencoding can be used to specify project
s preferred encoding if it is not UTF-8).</p>

<p>This was optional in prior versions of git, but now it
is the default. You can use --no-utf8 to override this.</p>

<p>--no-utf8 Pass -n flag to git mailinfo (see
git-mailinfo(1)).</p>

<p>-3, --3way When the patch does not apply cleanly, fall
back on 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of
blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have those blobs
available locally.</p>

<p>--ignore-date, --ignore-space-change,
--ignore-whitespace, --whitespace=&lt;option&gt;,
-C&lt;n&gt;, -p&lt;n&gt;, --directory=&lt;dir&gt;, --reject
These flags are passed to the git apply (see git-apply(1))
program that applies the patch.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Run interactively.</p>

<p>--committer-date-is-author-date By default the command
records the date from the e-mail message as the commit
author date, and uses the time of commit creation as the
committer date. This allows the user to lie about the
committer date by using the same value as the author
date.</p>

<p>--ignore-date By default the command records the date
from the e-mail message as the commit author date, and uses
the time of commit creation as the committer date. This
allows the user to lie about the author date by using the
same value as the committer date.</p>

<p>--skip Skip the current patch. This is only meaningful
when restarting an aborted patch.</p>

<p>--continue, -r, --resolved After a patch failure (e.g.
attempting to apply conflicting patch), the user has applied
it by hand and the index file stores the result of the
application. Make a commit using the authorship and commit
log extracted from the e-mail message and the current index
file, and continue.</p>

<p>--resolvemsg=&lt;msg&gt; When a patch failure occurs,
&lt;msg&gt; will be printed to the screen before exiting.
This overrides the standard message informing you to use
--resolved or --skip to handle the failure. This is solely
for internal use between git rebase and git am.</p>

<p>--abort Restore the original branch and abort the
patching operation.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION The commit author name is taken from the
&quot;From: &quot; line of the message, and commit author
date is taken from the &quot;Date: &quot; line of the
message. The &quot;Subject: &quot; line is used as the title
of the commit, after stripping common prefix &quot;[PATCH
&lt;anything&gt;]&quot;. The &quot;Subject: &quot; line is
supposed to concisely describe what the commit is about in
one line of text.</p>

<p>&quot;From: &quot; and &quot;Subject: &quot; lines
starting the body override the respective commit author name
and title values taken from the headers.</p>

<p>The commit message is formed by the title taken from the
&quot;Subject: &quot;, a blank line and the body of the
message up to where the patch begins. Excess whitespace at
the end of each line is automatically stripped.</p>

<p>The patch is expected to be inline, directly following
the message. Any line that is of the form:</p>

<p>&middot; three-dashes and end-of-line, or</p>

<p>&middot; a line that begins with &quot;diff -&quot;,
or</p>

<p>&middot; a line that begins with &quot;Index: &quot;</p>

<p>is taken as the beginning of a patch, and the commit log
message is terminated before the first occurrence of such a
line.</p>

<p>When initially invoking git am, you give it the names of
the mailboxes to process. Upon seeing the first patch that
does not apply, it aborts in the middle. You can recover
from this in one of two ways:</p>

<p>1. skip the current patch by re-running the command with
the --skip option.</p>

<p>2. hand resolve the conflict in the working directory,
and update the index file to bring it into a state that the
patch should have produced. Then run the command with the
--resolved option.</p>

<p>The command refuses to process new mailboxes while the
.git/rebase-apply directory exists, so if you decide to
start over from scratch, run rm -f -r .git/rebase-apply
before running the command with mailbox names.</p>

<p>Before any patches are applied, ORIG_HEAD is set to the
tip of the current branch. This is useful if you have
problems with multiple commits, like running git am on the
wrong branch or an error in the commits that is more easily
fixed by changing the mailbox (e.g. errors in the
&quot;From:&quot; lines).</p>
