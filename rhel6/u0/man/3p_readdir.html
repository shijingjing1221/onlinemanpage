<p>READDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual READDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME readdir, readdir_r - read a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);</p>

<p>int readdir_r(DIR *restrict dirp, struct dirent
*restrict entry, struct dirent **restrict result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The type DIR, which is defined in the
&lt;dirent.h&gt; header, represents a directory stream,
which is an ordered sequence of all the directory entries in
a particular directory. Directory entries represent files;
files may be removed from a directory or added to a
directory asyn- chronously to the operation of
readdir().</p>

<p>The readdir() function shall return a pointer to a
structure represent- ing the directory entry at the current
position in the directory stream specified by the argument
dirp, and position the directory stream at the next entry.
It shall return a null pointer upon reaching the end of the
directory stream. The structure dirent defined in the
&lt;dirent.h&gt; header describes a directory entry.</p>

<p>The readdir() function shall not return directory
entries containing empty names. If entries for dot or
dot-dot exist, one entry shall be returned for dot and one
entry shall be returned for dot-dot; other- wise, they shall
not be returned.</p>

<p>The pointer returned by readdir() points to data which
may be overwrit- ten by another call to readdir() on the
same directory stream. This data is not overwritten by
another call to readdir() on a different directory
stream.</p>

<p>If a file is removed from or added to the directory
after the most recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(),
whether a subsequent call to readdir() returns an entry for
that file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The readdir() function may buffer several directory
entries per actual read operation; readdir() shall mark for
update the st_atime field of the directory each time the
directory is actually read.</p>

<p>After a call to fork(), either the parent or child (but
not both) may continue processing the directory stream using
readdir(), rewinddir(), or seekdir(). If both the parent and
child processes use these func- tions, the result is
undefined.</p>

<p>If the entry names a symbolic link, the value of the
d_ino member is unspecified.</p>

<p>The readdir() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function shall initialize the dirent
structure refer- enced by entry to represent the directory
entry at the current position in the directory stream
referred to by dirp, store a pointer to this structure at
the location referenced by result, and position the direc-
tory stream at the next entry.</p>

<p>The storage pointed to by entry shall be large enough
for a dirent with an array of char d_name members containing
at least {NAME_MAX}+1 ele- ments.</p>

<p>Upon successful return, the pointer returned at *result
shall have the same value as the argument entry. Upon
reaching the end of the direc- tory stream, this pointer
shall have the value NULL.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function shall not return directory
entries containing empty names.</p>

<p>If a file is removed from or added to the directory
after the most recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(),
whether a subsequent call to readdir_r() returns an entry
for that file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function may buffer several directory
entries per actual read operation; the readdir_r() function
shall mark for update the st_atime field of the directory
each time the directory is actually read.</p>

<p>Applications wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to 0 before calling readdir(). If errno is
set to non-zero on return, an error occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, readdir() shall
return a pointer to an object of type struct dirent. When an
error is encountered, a null pointer shall be returned and
errno shall be set to indicate the error. When the end of
the directory is encountered, a null pointer shall be
returned and errno is not changed.</p>

<p>If successful, the readdir_r() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The readdir() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW One of the values in the structure to be
returned cannot be rep- resented correctly.</p>

<p>The readdir() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The dirp argument does not refer to an open
directory stream.</p>

<p>ENOENT The current position of the directory stream is
invalid.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The dirp argument does not refer to an open
directory stream.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following sample program searches the
current directory for each of the arguments supplied on the
command line.</p>

<p>#include &lt;dirent.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>static void lookup(const char *arg) { DIR *dirp; struct
dirent *dp;</p>

<p>if ((dirp = opendir(&quot;.&quot;)) == NULL) {
perror(&quot;couldt open&quot;); return; }</p>

<p>do { errno = 0; if ((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL) { if
(strcmp(dp-&gt;d_name, arg) != 0) continue;</p>

<p>(void) printf(&quot;found %n&quot;, arg); (void)
closedir(dirp); return;</p>

<p>} } while (dp != NULL);</p>

<p>if (errno != 0) perror(&quot;error reading
directory&quot;); else (void) printf(&quot;failed to find
%n&quot;, arg); (void) closedir(dirp); return; }</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int i; for (i = 1; i
&lt; argc; i++) lookup(arvg[i]); return (0); }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The readdir() function should be used
in conjunction with opendir(), closedir(), and rewinddir()
to examine the contents of the directory.</p>

<p>The readdir_r() function is thread-safe and shall return
values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a
static data area that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The returned value of readdir() merely
represents a directory entry. No equivalence should be
inferred.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of readdir() obtain multiple
directory entries on a single read operation, which permits
subsequent readdir() operations to operate from the buffered
information. Any wording that required each successful
readdir() operation to mark the directory st_atime field for
update would disallow such historical performance- oriented
implementations.</p>

<p>Since readdir() returns NULL when it detects an error
and when the end of the directory is encountered, an
application that needs to tell the difference must set errno
to zero before the call and check it if NULL is returned.
Since the function must not change errno in the second case
and must set it to a non-zero value in the first case, a
zero errno after a call returning NULL indicates
end-of-directory; other- wise, an error.</p>

<p>Routines to deal with this problem more directly were
proposed:</p>

<p>int derror (dirp) DIR *dirp;</p>

<p>void clearderr (dirp) DIR *dirp;</p>

<p>The first would indicate whether an error had occurred,
and the second would clear the error indication. The simpler
method involving errno was adopted instead by requiring that
readdir() not change errno when end-of-directory is
encountered.</p>

<p>An error or signal indicating that a directory has
changed while open was considered but rejected.</p>

<p>The thread-safe version of the directory reading
function returns val- ues in a user-supplied buffer instead
of possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten
by each call. Either the {NAME_MAX} com- pile-time constant
or the corresponding pathconf() option can be used to
determine the maximum sizes of returned pathnames.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
