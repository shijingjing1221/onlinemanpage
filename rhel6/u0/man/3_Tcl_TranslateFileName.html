<p>Tcl_TranslateFileName(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_TranslateFileName(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_TranslateFileName - convert file name to native
form and replace tilde with home directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * Tcl_TranslateFileName(interp, name,
bufferPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to report an error, if any.</p>

<p>const char *name (in) File name, which may start with a
~.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *bufferPtr (in/out) If needed, this dynamic
string is used to store the new file name. At the time of
the call it should be uninitialized or free. The caller must
eventually call Tcl_DStringFree to free up any- thing stored
here.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility procedure translates a file
name to a platform-specific form which, after being
converted to the appropriate encoding, is suit- able for
passing to the local operating system. In particular, it
con- verts network names into native form and does tilde
substitution.</p>

<p>However, with the advent of the newer
Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath and Tcl_GetNativePath, there is no
longer any need to use this procedure. In particular,
Tcl_GetNativePath performs all the necessary translation and
encoding conversion, is virtual-filesystem aware, and caches
the native result for faster repeated calls. Finally
Tcl_GetNativePath does not require you to free anything
afterwards.</p>

<p>If Tcl_TranslateFileName has to do tilde substitution or
translate the name then it uses the dynamic string at
*bufferPtr to hold the new string it generates. After
Tcl_TranslateFileName returns a non-NULL result, the caller
must eventually invoke Tcl_DStringFree to free any
information placed in *bufferPtr. The caller need not know
whether or not Tcl_TranslateFileName actually used the
string; Tcl_TranslateFile- Name initializes *bufferPtr even
if it does not use it, so the call to Tcl_DStringFree will
be safe in either case.</p>

<p>If an error occurs (e.g. because there was no user by
the given name) then NULL is returned and an error message
will be left in the inter- preter s result. When an error
occurs, Tcl_TranslateFileName frees the dynamic string
itself so that the caller need not call Tcl_DStringFree.</p>

<p>The caller is responsible for making sure that the
interpreters result has its default empty value when
Tcl_TranslateFileName is invoked.</p>
