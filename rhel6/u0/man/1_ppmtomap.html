<p>NAME ppmtomap - create a map of all colors in a PPM
image</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program exists only for backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Use pnmcolormap, which replaced it in January 2002.</p>

<p>One trivial difference between ppmtomap and pnmcolormap
all is that if the input is PBM or PGM, ppmtomap would
produce PPM output, whereas pnmcolormap all produces the
same kind of output as the input. This should not be very
noticeable, though, as PBM and PGM images are usu- ally
usable anywhere a PPM image is.</p>
