<p>X11PERFCOMP(1) X11PERFCOMP(1)</p>

<p>NAME x11perfcomp - X11 server performance comparison
program</p>

<p>SYNTAX x11perfcomp [ -r | -ro ] [ -l label_file ]
files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The x11perfcomp program merges the output of
several x11perf(1) runs into a nice tabular format. It takes
the results in each file, fills in any missing test results
if necessary, and for each test shows the objects/second
rate of each server. If invoked with the -r or -ro options,
it shows the relative performance of each server to the
first server.</p>

<p>Normally, x11perfcomp uses the first file specified to
determine which specific tests it should report on. Some
(non-DEC :) servers may fail to perform all tests. In this
case, x11perfcomp automatically substi- tutes in a rate of
0.0 objects/second. Since the first file determines which
tests to report on, this file must contain a superset of the
tests reported in the other files, else x11perfcomp will
fail.</p>

<p>You can provide an explicit list of tests to report on
by using the -l switch to specify a file of labels. You can
create a label file by using the -label option in
x11perf.</p>

<p>OPTIONS x11perfcomp accepts the options listed
below:</p>

<p>-r Specifies that the output should also include
relative server performance.</p>

<p>-ro Specifies that the output should include only
relative server performance.</p>

<p>-l label_file Specifies a label file to use.</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS There are no X defaults used by this
program.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), x11perf(1)</p>

<p>AUTHORS Mark Moraes wrote the original scripts to
compare servers. Joel McCormack just munged them together a
bit.</p>
