<p>MAILQ(1) MAILQ(1)</p>

<p>NAME mailq - print the mail queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mailq [-Ac] [-q...] [-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Mailq prints a summary of the mail messages
queued for future delivery.</p>

<p>The first line printed for each message shows the
internal identifier used on this host for the message with a
possible status character, the size of the message in bytes,
the date and time the message was accepted into the queue,
and the envelope sender of the message. The second line
shows the error message that caused this message to be
retained in the queue; it will not be present if the message
is being processed for the first time. The status characters
are either * to indicate the job is being processed; X to
indicate that the load is too high to process the job; and -
to indicate that the job is too young to process. The
following lines show message recipients, one per line.</p>

<p>Mailq is identical to sendmail -bp.</p>

<p>The relevant options are as follows:</p>

<p>-Ac Show the mail submission queue specified in
/etc/mail/submit.cf instead of the MTA queue specified in
/etc/mail/sendmail.cf.</p>

<p>-qL Show the &quot;lost&quot; items in the mail queue
instead of the normal queue items.</p>

<p>-qQ Show the quarantined items in the mail queue instead
of the nor- mal queue items.</p>

<p>-q[!]I substr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of the queue id or not when ! is
specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]Q substr Limit processed jobs to quarantined jobs
containing substr as a substring of the quarantine reason or
not when ! is specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]R substr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of one of the recipients or not when !
is specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]S substr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of the sender or not when ! is
specified.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information. This adds the priority of
the mes- sage and a single character indicator (+ or blank)
indicat- ing whether a warning message has been sent on the
first line of the message. Additionally, extra lines may be
intermixed with the recipients indicating the controlling
user information; this shows who will own any programs that
are executed on behalf of this message and the name of the
alias this command expanded from, if any. Moreover, status
messages for each recipient are printed if available.</p>

<p>Several sendmail.cf options influence the behavior of
the mailq util- ity: The number of items printed per queue
group is restricted by MaxQueueRunSize if that value is set.
The status character * is not printed for some values of
QueueSortOrder, e.g., filename, random, mod- ification, and
none, unless a -q option is used to limit the processed
jobs.</p>

<p>The mailq utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an
error occurs.</p>

<p>HISTORY The mailq command appeared in 4.0BSD.</p>
