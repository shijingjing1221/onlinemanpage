<p>NAME sg_prevent - sends a SCSI PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM
REMOVAL command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_prevent [--allow] [--help] [--prevent=PC]
[--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SCSI PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL
command to DEVICE. The default action of this utility is to
prevent the removing or ejecting of the medium from a drive.
This is done by ignoring the SCSI START STOP UNIT command
(see sg_start) and ignoring the eject button on the drive
when the user presses it. Drives that hold removable disks,
tape cartridges or cd/dvd media typically implement this
command. The defi- nition of the &quot;prevent&quot; codes
for this command differ between disks and tapes (covered by
SBC-3 and SSC-3) and cd/dvd drives (covered by MMC-5). The
&quot;prevent codes&quot; described here are from MMC-5.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-a, --allow allow medium removal. This is equivalent to
setting to --pre- vent=2 . Cannot be used with --prevent=PC
option (i.e. either use no options (hence prevent removal),
this option or --pre- vent=PC).</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-p, --prevent=PC where PC is a prevent code value.
Defined values are: 0 allows removal, 1 prevents removal
(default), 2 allows persistent removal while 3 prevents
persistent removal. &quot;Persistent&quot; in this context
means that the initiator (port) that successfully uses code
3 blocks other initiators (ports) from allowing removal. A
&quot;persistent prevent&quot; state can be cleared by the
owner allowing persistent removal (code 2) or a power cycle
(or anything that resets the device (lun)) or some special
commands (e.g. various service actions of Persistent Reserve
Out, see SPC-3).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_prevent is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
