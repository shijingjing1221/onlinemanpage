<p>NAME pamsharpmap - create map of sharpness in a PNM/PAM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsharpmap [imagefile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsharpmap reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and
produces an image that shows how sharp it is at each
location.</p>

<p>Sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors
change in the image. pamsharpmap computes the sharpness of
each component color (R, G, B) separately and produces a
pixel whose intensity of each component color is directly
proportional to the sharpness of that component color at the
same location in the input image. Thus, at a point where the
image is very sharp in its red and green components, but
dull in its blue component, you will see a yellow pixel in
the output.</p>

<p>pamsharpmap computes sharpness at a point simply as the
average differ- ence in intensity between the pixel at that
point and the 8 pixels sur- rounding it.</p>

<p>At the edges of the image, where there are not 8 pixels
surrounding a pixel, pamsharpmap assumes the image is
extended with a black border.</p>

<p>pamsharpmap assumes that the image is a PNM or PNM
equivalent PAM. If it isnt, the results are not necessarily
meaningful.</p>

<p>The output image is the same dimensions, depth, and
tuple type as the input, and has maxval 255.</p>

pam(1), pnm(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY pamsharpmap was added to Netpbm in Release 10.21
(March 2004). Bryan Henderson derived it from the program
pnmsharp by B.W. van Schooten and distributed as part of the
Photopnmtools package.</p>
