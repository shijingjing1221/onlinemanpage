<p>NAME credentials - process identifiers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Process ID (PID) Each process has a unique
non-negative integer identifier that is assigned when the
process is created using fork(2). A process can obtain its
PID using getpid(2). A PID is represented using the type
pid_t (defined in &lt;sys/types.h&gt;).</p>

<p>PIDs are used in a range of system calls to identify the
process affected by the call, for example: kill(2),
ptrace(2), setpriority(2) setpgid(2), setsid(2),
sigqueue(2), and waitpid(2).</p>

<p>A processs PID is preserved across an execve(2).</p>

<p>Parent Process ID (PPID) A process s parent process ID
identifies the process that created this process using
fork(2). A process can obtain its PPID using getppid(2). A
PPID is represented using the type pid_t.</p>

<p>A processs PPID is preserved across an execve(2).</p>

<p>Process Group ID and Session ID Each process has a
session ID and a process group ID, both represented using
the type pid_t. A process can obtain its session ID using
get- sid(2), and its process group ID using getpgrp(2).</p>

<p>A child created by fork(2) inherits its parents session
ID and process group ID. A processs session ID and process
group ID are preserved across an execve(2).</p>

<p>Sessions and process groups are abstractions devised to
support shell job control. A process group (sometimes called
a &quot;job&quot;) is a collec- tion of processes that share
the same process group ID; the shell cre- ates a new process
group for the process(es) used to execute single command or
pipeline (e.g., the two processes created to execute the
command &quot;ls | wc&quot; are placed in the same process
group). A processs group membership can be set using
setpgid(2). The process whose pro- cess ID is the same as
its process group ID is the process group leader for that
group.</p>

<p>A session is a collection of processes that share the
same session ID. All of the members of a process group also
have the same session ID (i.e., all of the members of a
process group always belong to the same session, so that
sessions and process groups form a strict two-level
hierarchy of processes.) A new session is created when a
process calls setsid(2), which creates a new session whose
session ID is the same as the PID of the process that called
setsid(2). The creator of the ses- sion is called the
session leader.</p>

<p>User and Group Identifiers Each process has various
associated user and groups IDs. These IDs are integers,
respectively represented using the types uid_t and gid_t
(defined in &lt;sys/types.h&gt;).</p>

<p>On Linux, each process has the following user and group
identifiers:</p>

<p>* Real user ID and real group ID. These IDs determine
who owns the process. A process can obtain its real user
(group) ID using getuid(2) (getgid(2)).</p>

<p>* Effective user ID and effective group ID. These IDs
are used by the kernel to determine the permissions that the
process will have when accessing shared resources such as
message queues, shared memory, and semaphores. On most Unix
systems, these IDs also determine the permissions when
accessing files. However, Linux uses the file sys- tem IDs
described below for this task. A process can obtain its
effective user (group) ID using geteuid(2) (getegid(2)).</p>

<p>* Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID. These IDs
are used in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs to save a
copy of the corre- sponding effective IDs that were set when
the program was executed (see execve(2)). A set-user-ID
program can assume and drop privi- leges by switching its
effective user ID back and forth between the values in its
real user ID and saved set-user-ID. This switching is done
via calls to seteuid(2), setreuid(2), or setresuid(2). A
set- group-ID program performs the analogous tasks using
setegid(2), setregid(2), or setresgid(2). A process can
obtain its saved set- user-ID (set-group-ID) using
getresuid(2) (getresgid(2)).</p>

<p>* File system user ID and file system group ID
(Linux-specific). These IDs, in conjunction with the
supplementary group IDs described below, are used to
determine permissions for accessing files; see
path_resolution(7) for details. Whenever a processs
effective user (group) ID is changed, the kernel also
automatically changes the file system user (group) ID to the
same value. Consequently, the file system IDs normally have
the same values as the corresponding effective ID, and the
semantics for file-permission checks are thus the same on
Linux as on other Unix systems. The file system IDs can be
made to differ from the effective IDs by calling setfsuid(2)
and setfsgid(2).</p>

<p>* Supplementary group IDs. This is a set of additional
group IDs that are used for permission checks when accessing
files and other shared resources. On Linux kernels before
2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 32 supplementary
groups; since kernel 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up
to 65536 supplementary groups. The call
sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) can be used to determine the number
of sup- plementary groups of which a process may be a
member. A process can obtain its set of supplementary group
IDs using getgroups(2), and can modify the set using
setgroups(2).</p>

<p>A child process created by fork(2) inherits copies of
its parents user and groups IDs. During an execve(2), a
processs real user and group ID and supplementary group IDs
are preserved; the effective and saved set IDs may be
changed, as described in execve(2).</p>

<p>Aside from the purposes noted above, a processs user IDs
are also employed in a number of other contexts:</p>

<p>* when determining the permissions for sending signals
see kill(2);</p>

<p>* when determining the permissions for setting
process-scheduling parameters (nice value, real time
scheduling policy and priority, CPU affinity, I/O priority)
using setpriority(2), sched_setaffin- ity(2),
sched_setscheduler(2), sched_setparam(2), and
ioprio_set(2);</p>

<p>* when checking resource limits; see getrlimit(2);</p>

<p>* when checking the limit on the number of inotify
instances that the process may create; see inotify(7).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Process IDs, parent process IDs, process
group IDs, and session IDs are specified in POSIX.1-2001.
The real, effective, and saved set user and groups IDs, and
the supplementary group IDs, are specified in POSIX.1-2001.
The file system user and group IDs are a Linux
extension.</p>

<p>NOTES The POSIX threads specification requires that
credentials are shared by all of the threads in a process.
However, at the kernel level, Linux maintains separate user
and group credentials for each thread. The NPTL threading
implementation does some work to ensure that any change to
user or group credentials (e.g., calls to setuid(2),
setresuid(2), etc.) is carried through to all of the POSIX
threads in a process.</p>
