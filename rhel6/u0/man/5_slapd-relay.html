<p>NAME slapd-relay - relay backend to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend
is to map a naming context defined in a database running in
the same slapd(8) instance into a vir- tual naming context,
with attributeType and objectClass manipulation, if
required. It requires the slapo-rwm(5) overlay.</p>

<p>This backend and the above mentioned overlay are
experimental.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following slapd.conf directives apply
to the relay backend database. That is, they must follow a
&quot;database relay&quot; line and come before any
subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot;
lines. Other database options are described in the
slapd.conf(5) manual page; only the suffix directive is
allowed by the relay backend.</p>

<p>relay &lt;real naming context&gt; The naming context of
the database that is presented under a virtual naming
context. The presence of this directive implies that one
specific database, i.e. the one serving the real naming
context, will be presented under a virtual naming
context.</p>

<p>MASSAGING The relay database does not automatically
rewrite the naming context of requests and responses. For
this purpose, the slapo-rwm(5) overlay must be explicitly
instantiated, and configured as appropriate. Usu- ally, the
rwm-suffixmassage directive suffices if only naming context
rewriting is required.</p>

<p>ACCESS RULES One important issue is that access rules
are based on the identity that issued the operation. After
massaging from the virtual to the real naming context, the
frontend sees the operation as performed by the identity in
the real naming context. Moreover, since back-relay bypasses
the real database frontend operations by short-circuiting
operations through the internal backend API, the original
database access rules do not apply but in selected cases,
i.e. when the backend itself applies access control. As a
consequence, the instances of the relay database must
provide own access rules that are consistent with those of
the original database, possibly adding further specific
restrictions. So, access rules in the relay database must
refer to identities in the real naming context. Examples are
reported in the EXAMPLES section.</p>

<p>SCENARIOS If no relay directive is given, the relay
database does not refer to any specific database, but the
most appropriate one is looked-up after rewriting the
request DN for the operation that is being handled.</p>

<p>This allows to write carefully crafted rewrite rules
that cause some of the requests to be directed to one
database, and some to another; e.g., authentication can be
mapped to one database, and searches to another, or
different target databases can be selected based on the DN
of the request, and so.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to map the same operation to
different databases based on details of the virtual naming
context, e.g. groups on one database and persons on
another.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To implement a plain virtual naming context
mapping that refers to a single database, use</p>

<p>database relay suffix
&quot;dc=virtual,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; relay
&quot;dc=real,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; overlay rwm
rwm-suffixmassage
&quot;dc=real,dc=naming,dc=context&quot;</p>

<p>To implement a plain virtual naming context mapping that
looks up the real naming context for each operation, use</p>

<p>database relay suffix
&quot;dc=virtual,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; overlay rwm
rwm-suffixmassage
&quot;dc=real,dc=naming,dc=context&quot;</p>

<p>This is useful, for instance, to relay different
databases that share the terminal portion of the naming
context (the one that is rewritten).</p>

<p>To implement the old-fashioned suffixalias, e.g. mapping
the virtual to the real naming context, but not the results
back from the real to the virtual naming context, use</p>

<p>database relay suffix
&quot;dc=virtual,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; relay
&quot;dc=real,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; overlay rwm
rwm-rewriteEngine on rwm-rewriteContext default
rwm-rewriteRule &quot;dc=virtual,dc=naming,dc=context&quot;
&quot;dc=real,dc=naming,dc=context&quot; &quot;:@&quot;
rwm-rewriteContext searchFilter rwm-rewriteContext
searchEntryDN rwm-rewriteContext searchAttrDN
rwm-rewriteContext matchedDN</p>

<p>Note that the slapo-rwm(5) overlay is instantiated, but
the rewrite rules are written explicitly, rather than
automatically as with the rwm-suffixmassage statement, to
map all the virtual to real naming con- text data flow, but
none of the real to virtual.</p>

<p>Access rules:</p>

<p>database bdb suffix &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; #
skip... access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
by dn.exact=&quot;cn=Supervisor,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
write by * read</p>

<p>database relay suffix &quot;o=Example,c=US&quot; relay
&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; overlay rwm rwm-suffixmassage
&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; # skip ... access to
dn.subtree=&quot;o=Example,c=US&quot; by
dn.exact=&quot;cn=Supervisor,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write
by dn.exact=&quot;cn=Relay
Supervisor,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write by * read</p>

<p>Note that, in both databases, the identities (the
&lt;who&gt; clause) are in the real naming context, i.e.
dc=example,dc=co, while the targets (the &lt;what&gt;
clause) are in the real and in the virtual naming context,
respectively.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The relay backend does not honor any of
the access control semantics described in slapd.access(5);
all access control is delegated to the relayed database(s).
Only read (=r) access to the entry pseudo- attribute and to
the other attribute values of the entries returned by the
search operation is honored, which is performed by the
frontend.</p>
