<p>USB_CLEAR_HALT(9) USB Core APIs USB_CLEAR_HALT(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_clear_halt - tells device to clear endpoint
halt/stall condition</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_clear_halt(struct usb_device * dev, int
pipe);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev device whose endpoint is halted</p>

<p>pipe endpoint pipe being cleared</p>

<p>CONTEXT !in_interrupt ()</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is used to clear halt conditions for
bulk and interrupt endpoints, as reported by URB completion
status. Endpoints that are halted are sometimes referred to
as being stalled. Such endpoints are unable to transmit or
receive data until the halt status is cleared. Any URBs
queued for such an endpoint should normally be unlinked by
the driver before clearing the halt condition, as described
in sections 5.7.5 and 5.8.5 of the USB 2.0 spec.</p>

<p>Note that control and isochronous endpoints don&acute;t
halt, although control endpoints report protocol stall (for
unsupported requests) using the same status code used to
report a true stall.</p>

<p>This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an
interrupt context.</p>

<p>Returns zero on success, or else the status code
returned by the underlying usb_control_msg call.</p>
