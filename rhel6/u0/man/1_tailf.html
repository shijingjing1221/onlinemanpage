<p>TAILF(1) Linux Programmer s Manual TAILF(1)</p>

<p>NAME tailf - follow the growth of a log file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tailf [OPTION] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tailf will print out the last 10 lines of a
file and then wait for the file to grow. It is similar to
tail -f but does not access the file when it is not growing.
This has the side effect of not updating the access time for
the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodi-
cally when no log activity is happening.</p>

<p>tailf is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a
laptop when logging is infrequent and the user desires that
the hard disk spin down to conserve battery life.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-n, --lines=N, -N output the last N lines, instead of
the last 10.</p>

<p>The latest inotify based implementation was written by
Karel Zak (kzak@redhat.com).</p>
