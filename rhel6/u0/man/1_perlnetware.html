<p>PERLNETWARE(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLNETWARE(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlnetware - Perl for NetWare</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file gives instructions for building
Perl 5.7 and above, and also Perl modules for NetWare.
Before you start, you may want to read the README file found
in the top level directory into which the Perl source code
distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and
understand the terms under which the software is being
distributed.</p>

<p>BUILD This section describes the steps to be performed
to build a Perl NLM and other associated NLMs.</p>

<p>Tools &amp; SDK The build requires CodeWarrior compiler
and linker. In addition, the &quot;NetWare SDK&quot;,
&quot;NLM &amp; NetWare Libraries for C&quot; and
&quot;NetWare Server Protocol Libraries for C&quot;, all
available at
&lt;http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Novell_Developer_Kit&gt;,
are required. Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2 or later is
also required.</p>

<p>Setup The build process is dependent on the location of
the NetWare SDK. Once the Tools &amp; SDK are installed, the
build environment has to be setup. The following batch files
setup the environment.</p>

<p>SetNWBld.bat The Execution of this file takes 2
parameters as input. The first being the NetWare SDK path,
second being the path for CodeWarrior Compiler &amp; tools.
Execution of this file sets these paths and also sets the
build type to Release by default.</p>

<p>Buildtype.bat This is used to set the build type to
debug or release. Change the build type only after executing
SetNWBld.bat</p>

<p>* Example: 1. Typing &quot;buildtype d on&quot; at the
command prompt causes the buildtype to be set to Debug type
with D2 flag set. 2. Typing &quot;buildtype d off&quot; or
&quot;buildtype d&quot; at the command prompt causes the
buildtype to be set to Debug type with D1 flag set. 2.
Typing &quot;buildtype r&quot; at the command prompt sets it
to Release Build type.</p>

<p>Make The make process runs only under WinNT shell. The
NetWare makefile is located under the NetWare folder. This
makes use of miniperl.exe to run some of the Perl scripts.
To create miniperl.exe, first set the required paths for
Visual c++ compilier (specify vcvars32 location) at the
command prompt. Then run nmake from win32 folder through
WinNT command prompt. The build process can be stopped after
miniperl.exe is created. Then run nmake from NetWare folder
through WinNT command prompt.</p>

<p>Currently the following two build types are tested on
NetWare:</p>

<p>&middot; USE_MULTI, USE_ITHREADS &amp; USE_IMP_SYS
defined</p>

<p>&middot; USE_MULTI &amp; USE_IMP_SYS defined and
USE_ITHREADS not defined</p>

<p>Interpreter Once miniperl.exe creation is over, run
nmake from the NetWare folder. This will build the Perl
interpreter for NetWare as perl.nlm. This is copied under
the Release folder if you are doing a release build, else
will be copied under Debug folder for debug builds.</p>

<p>Extensions The make process also creates the Perl
extensions as &lt;Extension.nlm&gt;</p>

<p>INSTALL To install NetWare Perl onto a NetWare server,
first map the Sys volume of a NetWare server to i:. This is
because the makefile by default sets the drive letter to i:.
Type nmake nwinstall from NetWare folder on a WinNT command
prompt. This will copy the binaries and module files onto
the NetWare server under sys:Perl folder. The Perl
interpreter, perl.nlm, is copied under sys:perlsystem
folder. Copy this to sys:system folder.</p>

<p>Example: At the command prompt Type &quot;nmake
nwinstall&quot;. This will install NetWare Perl on the
NetWare Server. Similiarly if you type &quot;nmake
install&quot;, This will cause the binaries to be installed
on the local machine. (Typically under the c:erl folder)</p>

<p>BUILD NEW EXTENSIONS To build extensions other than
standard extensions, NetWare Perl has to be installed on
Windows along with Windows Perl. The Perl for Windows can be
either downloaded from the CPAN site and built using the
sources, or the binaries can be directly downloaded from the
ActiveState site. Installation can be done by invoking nmake
install from the NetWare folder on a WinNT command prompt
after building NetWare Perl by following steps given above.
This will copy all the *.pm files and other required files.
Documentation files are not copied. Thus one must first
install Windows Perl, Then install NetWare Perl.</p>

<p>Once this is done, do the following to build any
extension:</p>

<p>&middot; Change to the extension directory where its
source files are present.</p>

<p>&middot; Run the following command at the command
prompt:</p>

<p>perl -II&lt;path to NetWare lib dir&gt; -II&lt;path to
lib&gt; Makefile.pl</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread
-Ic:erl5.6.1 MakeFile.pl</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread
-Ic:erl5.8.0 MakeFile.pl</p>

<p>&middot; nmake</p>

<p>&middot; nmake install</p>

<p>Install will copy the files into the Windows machine
where NetWare Perl is installed and these files may have to
be copied to the NetWare server manually. Alternatively,
pass INSTALLSITELIB=i:perllib as an input to makefile.pl
above. Here i: is the mapped drive to the sys: volume of the
server where Perl on NetWare is installed. Now typing nmake
install, will copy the files onto the NetWare server.</p>

<p>Example: You can execute the following on the command
prompt.</p>

<p>perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread
-Ic:erl5.6.1 MakeFile.pl INSTALLSITELIB=i:erl</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread
-Ic:erl5.8.0 MakeFile.pl INSTALLSITELIB=i:erl</p>

<p>&middot; Note: Some modules downloaded from CPAN may
require NetWare related API in order to build on NetWare.
Other modules may however build smoothly with or without
minor changes depending on the type of module.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The makefile for Win32 is used as a
reference to create the makefile for NetWare. Also, the make
process for NetWare port uses miniperl.exe to run scripts
during the make and installation process.</p>
