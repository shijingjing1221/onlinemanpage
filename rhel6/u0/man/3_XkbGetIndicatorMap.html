<p>XkbGetIndicatorMap(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetIndicatorMap(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetIndicatorMap - Gets the map for one or more
indicators, using a mask to specify the indicators</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetIndicatorMap (Display *dpy,
unsigned int which, XkbDescPtr desc);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to the X server</p>

<p>- which mask of indicators for which maps should be
returned</p>

<p>- desc keyboard description to be updated</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb allows applications to obtain
information about indicators using two different methods.
The first method, which is similar to the core X
implementation, uses a mask to specify the indicators. The
second method, which is more suitable for applications
concerned with interop- erability, uses indicator names. The
correspondence between the indica- tor name and the bit
position in masks is as follows: one of the param- eters
returned from XkbGetNamedIndicators is an index that is the
bit position to use in any function call that requires a
mask of indicator bits, as well as the indicator s index
into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.</p>

<p>XkbGetIndicatorMap obtains the maps from the server for
only those indicators specified by the which mask and copies
the values into the keyboard description specified by desc.
If the indicators field of the desc parameter is NULL,
XkbGetIndicatorMap allocates and initializes it.</p>

<p>To free the indicator maps, use
XkbFreeIndicatorMaps.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not available
in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but
is otherwise invalid</p>

<p>BadImplementation Invalid reply from server</p>
