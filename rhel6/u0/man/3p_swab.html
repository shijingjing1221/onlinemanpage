<p>SWAB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SWAB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME swab - swap bytes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void swab(const void *restrict src, void *restrict dest,
ssize_t nbytes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The swab() function shall copy nbytes bytes,
which are pointed to by src, to the object pointed to by
dest, exchanging adjacent bytes. The nbytes argument should
be even. If nbytes is odd, swab() copies and exchanges
nbytes-1 bytes and the disposition of the last byte is
unspecified. If copying takes place between objects that
overlap, the behavior is undefined. If nbytes is negative,
swab() does nothing.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE None.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
