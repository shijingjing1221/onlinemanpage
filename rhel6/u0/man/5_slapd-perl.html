<p>NAME slapd-perl - Perl backend to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Perl backend to slapd(8) works by
embedding a perl(1) interpreter into slapd(8). Any perl
database section of the configuration file slapd.conf(5)
must then specify what Perl module to use. Slapd then
creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for
that par- ticular instance of the backend.</p>

<p>You will need to create a method for each one of the
following actions:</p>

<p>* new # creates a new object, * search # performs the
ldap search, * compare # does a compare, * modify # modifies
an entry, * add # adds an entry to backend, * modrdn #
modifies an entrys rdn, * delete # deletes an ldap entry, *
config # process unknown config file lines, * init # called
after backend is initialized.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the methods return the
result code which will be returned to the client.
Unimplemented actions can just return unwillingToPerform
(53).</p>

<p>new This method is called when the configuration file
encounters a perlmod line. The module in that line is then
effectively used into the perl interpreter, then the new
method is called to create a new object. Note that multiple
instances of that object may be instantiated, as with any
perl object. The new method receives the class name as
argument.</p>

<p>search This method is called when a search request comes
from a client. It arguments are as follows: * object
reference * base DN * scope * alias dereferencing policy *
size limit * time limit * filter string * attributes only
flag (1 for yes) * list of attributes to return (may be
empty)</p>

<p>Return value: (resultcode, ldif-entry, ldif-entry,
...)</p>

<p>compare This method is called when a compare request
comes from a client. Its arguments are as follows. * object
reference * dn * attribute assertion string</p>

<p>modify This method is called when a modify request comes
from a client. Its arguments are as follows. * object
reference * dn * a list formatted as follows ({
&quot;ADD&quot; | &quot;DELETE&quot; | &quot;REPLACE&quot;
}, attributetype, value...)...</p>

<p>add This method is called when a add request comes from
a client. Its arguments are as follows. * object reference *
entry in string format</p>

<p>modrdn This method is called when a modrdn request comes
from a client. Its arguments are as follows. * object
reference * dn * new rdn * delete old dn flag (1 means
yes)</p>

<p>delete This method is called when a delete request comes
from a client. Its arguments are as follows. * object
reference * dn</p>

<p>config This method is called with unknown slapd.conf(5)
configuration file lines. Its arguments are as follows. *
object reference * array of arguments on line</p>

<p>Return value: nonzero if this is not a valid option.</p>

<p>init This method is called after backend is initialized.
Its argu- ment is as follows. * object reference</p>

<p>Return value: nonzero if initialization failed.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the PERL
backend database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database
perl&quot; line and come before any subsequent
&quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; lines. Other
database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>perlModulePath /path/to/libs Add the path to the @INC
variable.</p>

<p>perlModule ModName Use the module name ModName from
ModName.pm</p>

<p>filterSearchResults Search results are candidates that
need to be filtered (with the filter in the search request),
rather than search results to be returned directly to the
client.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE There is an example Perl module SampleLDAP in
the slapd/back-perl/ directory in the OpenLDAP source
tree.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The passwd backend does not honor any of
the access control semantics described in slapd.access(5);
all access control is delegated to the underlying PERL
scripting. Only read (=r) access to the entry pseudo-
attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries
returned by the search operation is honored, which is
performed by the frontend.</p>

<p>WARNING The interface of this backend to the perl module
MAY change. Any sug- gestions would greatly be
appreciated.</p>
