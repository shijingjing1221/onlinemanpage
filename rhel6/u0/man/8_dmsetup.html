<p>devmap_name major minor devmap_name major:minor</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dmsetup manages logical devices that use the
device-mapper driver. Devices are created by loading a table
that specifies a target for each sector (512 bytes) in the
logical device.</p>

<p>The first argument to dmsetup is a command. The second
argument is the logical device name or uuid.</p>

<p>Invoking the command as devmap_name is equivalent to
dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j major -m minor.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c|-C|--columns Display output in columns rather
than as Field: Value lines.</p>

<p>-h|--help Outputs a summary of the commands available,
optionally includ- ing the list of report fields (synonym
with help command).</p>

<p>--inactive When returning any table information from the
kernel report on the inactive table instead of the live
table. Requires kernel driver version 4.16.0 or above.</p>

<p>-j|--major major Specify the major number.</p>

<p>-m|--minor minor Specify the minor number.</p>

<p>-n|--noheadings Suppress the headings line when using
columnar output.</p>

<p>--noopencount Tell the kernel not to supply the open
reference count for the device.</p>

<p>--notable When creating a device, dont load any
table.</p>

<p>--udevcookie cookie Use cookie for udev
synchronisation.</p>

<p>--noudevrules Do not allow udev to manage nodes for
devices in device-mapper directory.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Do not synchronise with udev when creating,
renaming or removing devices.</p>

<p>-o|--options Specify which fields to display.</p>

<p>-r|--readonly Set the table being loaded read-only.</p>

<p>--readahead [+]&lt;sectors&gt;|auto|none Specify read
ahead size in units of sectors. The default value is
&quot;auto&quot; which allows the kernel to choose a
suitable value automatically. The + prefix lets you specify
a minimum value which will not be used if it is smaller than
the value chosen by the kernel. &quot;None&quot; is
equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>--table &lt;table&gt; Specify a one-line table directly
on the command line.</p>

<p>-u|--uuid Specify the uuid.</p>

<p>-y|--yes Answer yes to all prompts automatically.</p>

<p>-v|--verbose [-v|--verbose] Produce additional
output.</p>

<p>--version Display the library and kernel driver
version.</p>

<p>COMMANDS clear device_name Destroys the table in the
inactive table slot for device_name.</p>

<p>create device_name [-u uuid] [--notable | --table
&lt;table&gt; | table_file] Creates a device with the given
name. If table_file or &lt;table&gt; is supplied, the table
is loaded and made live. Otherwise a ta- ble is read from
standard input unless --notable is used. The optional uuid
can be used in place of device_name in subsequent dmsetup
commands. If successful a device will appear as
/dev/device-mapper/&lt;device-name&gt;. See below for
information on the table format.</p>

<p>deps [device_name] Outputs a list of (major, minor)
pairs for devices referenced by the live table for the
specified device.</p>

<p>help [-c|-C|--columns] Outputs a summary of the commands
available, optionally includ- ing the list of report
fields.</p>

<p>info [device_name] Outputs some brief information about
the device in the form: State: SUSPENDED|ACTIVE, READ-ONLY
Tables present: LIVE and/or INACTIVE Open reference count
Last event sequence number (used by wait) Major and minor
device number Number of targets in the live table UUID</p>

<p>info -c|-C|--columns [--noheadings] [--separator
separator] [-o fields] [-O|--sort sort_fields] [device_name]
Output you can customise. Fields are comma-separated and
chosen from the following list: name, major, minor, attr,
open, seg- ments, events, uuid. Attributes are: (L)ive,
(I)nactive, (s)uspended, (r)ead-only, read-(w)rite. Precede
the list with + to append to the default selection of
columns instead of replacing it. Precede any sort_field with
- for a reverse sort on that column.</p>

<p>ls [--target target_type] [--exec command] [--tree [-o
options]] List device names. Optionally only list devices
that have at least one target of the specified type.
Optionally execute a command for each device. The device
name is appended to the supplied command. --tree displays
dependencies between devices as a tree. It accepts a
comma-separate list of options. Some specify the information
displayed against each node: device/nodevice; active, open,
rw, uuid. Others specify how the tree is displayed: ascii,
utf, vt100; compact, inverted, notrunc.</p>

<p>load|reload device_name [--table &lt;table&gt; |
table_file] Loads &lt;table&gt; or table_file into the
inactive table slot for device_name. If neither is supplied,
reads a table from stan- dard input.</p>

<p>message device_name sector message Send message to
target. If sector not needed use 0.</p>

<p>mknodes [device_name] Ensure that the node in
/dev/mapper for device_name is correct. If no device_name is
supplied, ensure that all nodes in /dev/mapper correspond to
mapped devices currently loaded by the device-mapper kernel
driver, adding, changing or removing nodes as necessary.</p>

<p>remove [-f|--force] device_name Removes a device. It
will no longer be visible to dmsetup. Open devices cannot be
removed except with older kernels that contain a version of
device-mapper prior to 4.8.0. In this case the device will
be deleted when its open_count drops to zero. From version
4.8.0 onwards, if a device can t be removed because an
uninterruptible process is waiting for I/O to return from
it, adding --force will replace the table with one that
fails all I/O, which might allow the process to be
killed.</p>

<p>remove_all [-f|--force] Attempts to remove all device
definitions i.e. reset the driver. Use with care! From
version 4.8.0 onwards, if devices cant be removed because
uninterruptible processes are waiting for I/O to return from
them, adding --force will replace the table with one that
fails all I/O, which might allow the process to be killed.
This also runs mknodes afterwards.</p>

<p>rename device_name new_name Renames a device.</p>

<p>resume device_name Un-suspends a device. If an inactive
table has been loaded, it becomes live. Postponed I/O then
gets re-queued for processing.</p>

<p>setgeometry device_name cyl head sect start Sets the
device geometry to C/H/S.</p>

<p>splitname device_name [subsystem] Splits given device
name into subsystem constituents. Default subsystem is
LVM.</p>

<p>status [--target target_type] [device_name] Outputs
status information for each of the devices targets. With
--target, only information relating to the specified target
type is displayed.</p>

<p>suspend [--nolockfs] [--noflush] device_name Suspends a
device. Any I/O that has already been mapped by the device
but has not yet completed will be flushed. Any further I/O
to that device will be postponed for as long as the device
is suspended. If there s a filesystem on the device which
sup- ports the operation, an attempt will be made to sync it
first unless --nolockfs is specified. Some targets such as
recent (October 2006) versions of multipath may support the
--noflush option. This lets outstanding I/O that has not yet
reached the device to remain unflushed.</p>

<p>table [--target target_type] [--showkeys] [device_name]
Outputs the current table for the device in a format that
can be fed back in using the create or load commands. With
--target, only information relating to the specified target
type is dis- played. Encryption keys are suppressed in the
table output for the crypt target unless the --showkeys
parameter is supplied.</p>

<p>targets Displays the names and versions of the
currently-loaded targets.</p>

<p>udevcreatecookie Creates a new cookie to synchronize
actions with udev process- ing. The output is a cookie
value. Normally we dont need to create cookies since dmsetup
creates and destroys them for each action automatically.
However, we can generate one explicitly to group several
actions together and use only one cookie instead. We can
define a cookie to use for each relevant command by using
--udevcookie option. Alternatively, we can export this value
into the environment of the dmsetup process as
DM_UDEV_COOKIE variable and it will be used automatically
with all subsequent commands until it is unset. Invoking
this command will create system-wide semaphore that needs to
be cleaned up explicitly by calling udevreleasecookie
command.</p>

<p>udevreleasecookie [cookie] Waits for all pending udev
processing bound to given cookie value and clean up the
cookie with underlying semaphore. If the cookie is not given
directly, the command will try to use a value defined by
DM_UDEV_COOKIE environment variable.</p>

<p>udevflags cookie Parses given cookie value and extracts
any udev control flags encoded. The output is in environment
key format that is suit- able for use in udev rules. If the
flag has its symbolic name assigned then the ouput is
DM_UDEV_FLAG_&lt;flag_name&gt;=1,
DM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=1 otherwise. Subsystem
udev flags don t have symbolic names assigned and these ones
are always reported as
DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG&lt;flag_position&gt;=1 . There are 16
udev flags altogether.</p>

<p>udevcomplete cookie Wake any processes that are waiting
for udev to complete pro- cessing the specified cookie.</p>

<p>udevcomplete_all Remove all cookies. Any process waiting
on a cookie will be resumed immediately.</p>

<p>udevcookies List all existing cookies. Cookies are
system-wide semaphores with keys prefixed by two predefined
bytes (0x0D4D).</p>

<p>version Outputs version information.</p>

<p>wait device_name [event_nr] Sleeps until the event
counter for device_name exceeds event_nr. Use -v to see the
event number returned. To wait until the next event is
triggered, use info to find the last event number.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT Each line of the table specifies a single
target and is of the form: logical_start_sector num_sectors
target_type target_args</p>

<p>There are currently three simple target types available
together with more complex optional ones that implement
snapshots and mirrors.</p>

<p>linear destination_device start_sector The traditional
linear mapping.</p>

<p>striped num_stripes chunk_size [destination
start_sector]+ Creates a striped area. e.g. striped 2 32
/dev/hda1 0 /dev/hdb1 0 will map the first chunk (16k) as
follows: LV chunk 1 -&gt; hda1, chunk 1 LV chunk 2 -&gt;
hdb1, chunk 1 LV chunk 3 -&gt; hda1, chunk 2 LV chunk 4
-&gt; hdb1, chunk 2 etc.</p>

<p>error Errors any I/O that goes to this area. Useful for
testing or for creating devices with holes in them.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # A table to join two disks together 0 1028160
linear /dev/hda 0 1028160 3903762 linear /dev/hdb 0</p>

<p># A table to stripe across the two disks, # and add the
spare space from # hdb to the back of the volume</p>

<p>0 2056320 striped 2 32 /dev/hda 0 /dev/hdb 0 2056320
2875602 linear /dev/hdb 1028160</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DM_DEV_DIR The device directory
name. Defaults to &quot;/dev&quot; and must be an absolute
path.</p>

<p>DM_UDEV_COOKIE A cookie to use for all relevant commands
to synchronize with udev processing. It is an alternative to
using --udevcookie option.</p>
