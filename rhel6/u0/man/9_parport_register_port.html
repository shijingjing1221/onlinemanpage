<p>PARPORT_REGISTER_POR(9) Parallel Port Devices
PARPORT_REGISTER_POR(9)</p>

<p>NAME parport_register_port - register a parallel
port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct parport * parport_register_port(unsigned
long base, int irq, int dma, struct parport_operations *
ops);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS base base I/O address</p>

<p>irq IRQ line</p>

<p>dma DMA channel</p>

<p>ops pointer to the port driver&acute;s port operations
structure</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a parallel port (lowlevel) driver finds
a port that should be made available to parallel port device
drivers, it should call parport_register_port. The base,
irq, and dma parameters are for the convenience of port
drivers, and for ports where they aren&acute;t meaningful
needn&acute;t be set to anything special. They can be
altered afterwards by adjusting the relevant members of the
parport structure that is returned and represents the port.
They should not be tampered with after calling
parport_announce_port, however.</p>

<p>If there are parallel port device drivers in the system
that have registered themselves using
parport_register_driver, they are not told about the port at
this time; that is done by parport_announce_port.</p>

<p>The ops structure is allocated by the caller, and must
not be deallocated before calling parport_remove_port.</p>

<p>If there is no memory to allocate a new parport
structure, this function will return NULL.</p>
