<p>CANCEL_WORK_SYNC(9) Driver Basics
CANCEL_WORK_SYNC(9)</p>

<p>NAME cancel_work_sync - block until a
work_struct&acute;s callback has terminated</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int cancel_work_sync(struct work_struct *
work);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS work the work which is to be flushed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns true if work was pending.</p>

<p>cancel_work_sync will cancel the work if it is queued.
If the work&acute;s callback appears to be running,
cancel_work_sync will block until it has completed.</p>

<p>It is possible to use this function if the work
re-queues itself. It can cancel the work even if it migrates
to another workqueue, however in that case it only
guarantees that work-&gt;func has completed on the last
queued workqueue.</p>

<p>cancel_work_sync(delayed_work-&gt;work) should be used
only if -&gt;timer is not pending, otherwise it goes into a
busy-wait loop until the timer expires.</p>

<p>The caller must ensure that workqueue_struct on which
this work was last queued can&acute;t be destroyed before
this function returns.</p>
