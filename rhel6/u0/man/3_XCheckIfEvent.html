<p>XIfEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XIfEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIfEvent, XCheckIfEvent, XPeekIfEvent - check the
event queue with a predicate procedure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent
*event_return, Bool (*predi- cate)(), XPointer arg);</p>

<p>Bool XCheckIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent
*event_return, Bool (*pred- icate)(), XPointer arg);</p>

<p>int XPeekIfEvent(Display *display, XEvent *event_return,
Bool (*predi- cate)(), XPointer arg);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS arg Specifies the user-supplied argument that
will be passed to the predicate procedure.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>event_return Returns either a copy of or the matched
events associated structure.</p>

<p>predicate Specifies the procedure that is to be called
to determine if the next event in the queue matches what you
want.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XIfEvent function completes only when
the specified predicate pro- cedure returns True for an
event, which indicates an event in the queue matches.
XIfEvent flushes the output buffer if it blocks waiting for
additional events. XIfEvent removes the matching event from
the queue and copies the structure into the client-supplied
XEvent structure.</p>

<p>When the predicate procedure finds a match,
XCheckIfEvent copies the matched event into the
client-supplied XEvent structure and returns True. (This
event is removed from the queue.) If the predicate proce-
dure finds no match, XCheckIfEvent returns False, and the
output buffer will have been flushed. All earlier events
stored in the queue are not discarded.</p>

<p>The XPeekIfEvent function returns only when the
specified predicate procedure returns True for an event.
After the predicate procedure finds a match, XPeekIfEvent
copies the matched event into the client- supplied XEvent
structure without removing the event from the queue.
XPeekIfEvent flushes the output buffer if it blocks waiting
for addi- tional events.</p>

<p>Each of these functions requires you to pass a predicate
procedure that determines if an event matches what you want.
Your predicate procedure must decide if the event is useful
without calling any Xlib functions. If the predicate
directly or indirectly causes the state of the event queue
to change, the result is not defined. If Xlib has been
initial- ized for threads, the predicate is called with the
display locked and the result of a call by the predicate to
any Xlib function that locks the display is not defined
unless the caller has first called XLockDis- play.</p>

<p>The predicate procedure and its associated arguments
are:</p>

<p>Bool (*predicate)(Display *display, XEvent *event,
XPointer arg)</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>event Specifies the XEvent structure.</p>

<p>arg Specifies the argument passed in from the XIfEvent,
XCheck- IfEvent, or XPeekIfEvent function.</p>

<p>The predicate procedure is called once for each event in
the queue until it finds a match. After finding a match, the
predicate procedure must return True. If it did not find a
match, it must return False.</p>
