<p>NAME update - Process pending events and idle
callbacks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS update ?idletasks?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command is used to bring the
application up to date by entering the event loop repeatedly
until all pending events (including idle callbacks) have
been processed.</p>

<p>If the idletasks keyword is specified as an argument to
the command, then no new events or errors are processed;
only idle callbacks are invoked. This causes operations that
are normally deferred, such as display updates and window
layout calculations, to be performed immedi- ately.</p>

<p>The update idletasks command is useful in scripts where
changes have been made to the applications state and you
want those changes to appear on the display immediately,
rather than waiting for the script to complete. Most display
updates are performed as idle callbacks, so update idletasks
will cause them to run. However, there are some kinds of
updates that only happen in response to events, such as
those trig- gered by window size changes; these updates will
not occur in update idletasks.</p>

<p>The update command with no options is useful in scripts
where you are performing a long-running computation but you
still want the applica- tion to respond to events such as
user interactions; if you occasion- ally call update then
user input will be processed during the next call to
update.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Run computations for about a second and then
finish: set x 1000 set done 0 after 1000 set done 1 while
{!$done} { # A very silly example! set x [expr {log($x) **
2.8}]</p>

<p># Test to see if our time-limit has been hit. This would
# also give a chance for serving network sockets and, if #
the Tk package is loaded, updating a user interface. update
