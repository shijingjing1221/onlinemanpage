<p>NAME re_syntax - Syntax of Tcl regular expressions
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A regular expression describes strings of
characters. Its a pattern that matches certain strings and
does not match others.</p>

<p>DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF REs Regular expressions (REs), as
defined by POSIX, come in two flavors: extended REs ( ERE s)
and basic REs (BREs). EREs are roughly those of the
traditional egrep, while BREs are roughly those of the
tradi- tional ed. This implementation adds a third flavor,
advanced REs (AREs), basically EREs with some significant
extensions.</p>

<p>This manual page primarily describes AREs. BREs mostly
exist for back- ward compatibility in some old programs;
they will be discussed at the end. POSIX EREs are almost an
exact subset of AREs. Features of AREs that are not present
in EREs will be indicated.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX Tcl regular expressions are
implemented using the package written by Henry Spencer,
based on the 1003.2 spec and some (not quite all) of the
Perl5 extensions (thanks, Henry!). Much of the description
of regular expressions below is copied verbatim from his
manual entry.</p>

<p>An ARE is one or more branches, separated by |, matching
anything that matches any of the branches.</p>

<p>A branch is zero or more constraints or quantified
atoms, concatenated. It matches a match for the first,
followed by a match for the second, etc; an empty branch
matches the empty string.</p>

<p>QUANTIFIERS A quantified atom is an atom possibly
followed by a single quantifier. Without a quantifier, it
matches a single match for the atom. The quantifiers, and
what a so-quantified atom matches, are:</p>

<p>* a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom</p>

<p>+ a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom</p>

<p>? a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom</p>

<p>{m} a sequence of exactly m matches of the atom</p>

<p>{m,} a sequence of m or more matches of the atom</p>

<p>{m,n} a sequence of m through n (inclusive) matches of
the atom; m may not exceed n</p>

<p>*? +? ?? {m}? {m,}? {m,n}? non-greedy quantifiers, which
match the same possibilities, but prefer the smallest number
rather than the largest number of matches (see MATCHING)</p>

<p>The forms using { and } are known as bounds. The numbers
m and n are unsigned decimal integers with permissible
values from 0 to 255 inclu- sive.</p>

<p>ATOMS An atom is one of:</p>

<p>(re) matches a match for re (re is any regular
expression) with the match noted for possible reporting</p>

<p>(?:re) as previous, but does no reporting (a
non-capturing set of parentheses)</p>

<p>() matches an empty string, noted for possible
reporting</p>

<p>(?:) matches an empty string, without reporting</p>

<p>[chars] a bracket expression, matching any one of the
chars (see BRACKET EXPRESSIONS for more detail)</p>

<p>. matches any single character</p>

<p>k matches the non-alphanumeric character k taken as an
ordinary character, e.g.\matches a backslash character</p>

<p>c where c is alphanumeric (possibly followed by other
charac- ters), an escape (AREs only), see ESCAPES below</p>

<p>{ when followed by a character other than a digit,
matches the left-brace character {; when followed by a
digit, it is the beginning of a bound (see above)</p>

<p>x where x is a single character with no other
significance, matches that character.</p>

<p>CONSTRAINTS A constraint matches an empty string when
specific conditions are met. A constraint may not be
followed by a quantifier. The simple con- straints are as
follows; some more constraints are described later, under
ESCAPES.</p>

<p>^ matches at the beginning of a line</p>

<p>$ matches at the end of a line</p>

<p>(?=re) positive lookahead (AREs only), matches at any
point where a substring matching re begins</p>

<p>(?!re) negative lookahead (AREs only), matches at any
point where no substring matching re begins</p>

<p>The lookahead constraints may not contain back
references (see later), and all parentheses within them are
considered non-capturing.</p>

<p>An RE may not end with.</p>

<p>BRACKET EXPRESSIONS A bracket expression is a list of
characters enclosed in []. It nor- mally matches any single
character from the list (but see below). If the list begins
with ^, it matches any single character (but see below) not
from the rest of the list.</p>

<p>If two characters in the list are separated by - , this
is shorthand for the full range of characters between those
two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g. [0-9] in
Unicode matches any conventional decimal digit. Two ranges
may not share an endpoint, so e.g. a-c-e is illegal. Ranges
in Tcl always use the Unicode collating sequence, but other
programs may use other collating sequences and this can be a
source of incompatability between programs.</p>

<p>To include a literal ] or - in the list, the simplest
method is to enclose it in [. and .] to make it a collating
element (see below). Alternatively, make it the first
character (following a possible ^), or (AREs only) precede
it with. Alternatively, for -, make it the last character,
or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal - as the
first endpoint of a range, make it a collating element or
(AREs only) precede it with. With the exception of these,
some combinations using [ (see next paragraphs), and
escapes, all other spe- cial characters lose their special
significance within a bracket expression.</p>

<p>CHARACTER CLASSES Within a bracket expression, the name
of a character class enclosed in [: and :] stands for the
list of all characters (not all collating ele- ments!)
belonging to that class. Standard character classes are:</p>

<p>alpha A letter.</p>

<p>upper An upper-case letter.</p>

<p>lower A lower-case letter.</p>

<p>digit A decimal digit.</p>

<p>xdigit A hexadecimal digit.</p>

<p>alnum An alphanumeric (letter or digit).</p>

<p>print A &quot;printable&quot; (same as graph, except
also including space).</p>

<p>blank A space or tab character.</p>

<p>space A character producing white space in displayed
text.</p>

<p>punct A punctuation character.</p>

<p>graph A character with a visible representation
(includes both alnum and punct).</p>

<p>cntrl A control character.</p>

<p>A locale may provide others. A character class may not
be used as an endpoint of a range.</p>

<p>(Note: the current Tcl implementation has only one
locale, the Unicode locale, which supports exactly the above
classes.)</p>

<p>BRACKETED CONSTRAINTS There are two special cases of
bracket expressions: the bracket expres- sions [[:&lt;:]]
and [[:&gt;:]] are constraints, matching empty strings at
the beginning and end of a word respectively. A word is
defined as a sequence of word characters that is neither
preceded nor followed by word characters. A word character
is an alnum character or an under- score ( _ ). These
special bracket expressions are deprecated; users of AREs
should use constraint escapes instead (see below).</p>

<p>COLLATING ELEMENTS Within a bracket expression, a
collating element (a character, a multi- character sequence
that collates as if it were a single character, or a
collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in [. and .]
stands for the sequence of characters of that collating
element. The sequence is a single element of the bracket
expression s list. A bracket expression in a locale that has
multi-character collating elements can thus match more than
one character. So (insidiously), a bracket expression that
starts with ^ can match multi-character collating elements
even if none of them appear in the bracket expression!</p>

<p>(Note: Tcl has no multi-character collating elements.
This information is only for illustration.)</p>

<p>For example, assume the collating sequence includes a ch
multi-charac- ter collating element. Then the RE [[.ch.]]*c
(zero or more chs followed by c) matches the first five
characters of chchcc . Also, the RE [^c]b matches all of chb
(because [^c] matches the multi- character ch).</p>

<p>EQUIVALENCE CLASSES Within a bracket expression, a
collating element enclosed in [= and =] is an equivalence
class, standing for the sequences of characters of all
collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself.
(If there are no other equivalent collating elements, the
treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters were [. and .].)
For example, if o and &ocirc; are the members of an
equivalence class, then [[=o=]], [[=&ocirc;=]], and
[o&ocirc;] are all synonymous. An equivalence class may not
be an end- point of a range.</p>

<p>(Note: Tcl implements only the Unicode locale. It does
not define any equivalence classes. The examples above are
just illustrations.)</p>

<p>ESCAPES Escapes (AREs only), which begin with a followed
by an alphanumeric character, come in several varieties:
character entry, class short- hands, constraint escapes, and
back references. A followed by an alphanumeric character but
not constituting a valid escape is illegal in AREs. In EREs,
there are no escapes: outside a bracket expression, a
followed by an alphanumeric character merely stands for that
charac- ter as an ordinary character, and inside a bracket
expression, is an ordinary character. (The latter is the one
actual incompatibility between EREs and AREs.)</p>

<p>CHARACTER-ENTRY ESCAPES Character-entry escapes (AREs
only) exist to make it easier to specify non-printing and
otherwise inconvenient characters in REs:</p>

<p>a alert (bell) character, as in C</p>

<p>b b a c k s p a c e , a s i n C</p>

<p>0 to help reduce backslash doubling in some applica-
tions where there are multiple levels of backslash
processing</p>

<p>are the same as those of X, and whose other bits are all
zero</p>

<p>e the character whose collating-sequence name is ESC, or
failing that, the character with octal value 033</p>

<p>f formfeed, as in C</p>

<p>n newline, as in C</p>

<p>r carriage return, as in C</p>

<p>t horizontal tab, as in C</p>

<p>uwxyz (where wxyz is exactly four hexadecimal digits)
the Unicode character U+wxyz in the local byte ordering</p>

<p>Ustuvwxyz (where stuvwxyz is exactly eight hexadecimal
digits) reserved for a somewhat-hypothetical Unicode
extension to 32 bits</p>

<p>vertical tab, as in C are all available.</p>

<p>hhh (where hhh is any sequence of hexadecimal digits)
the character whose hexadecimal value is 0xhhh (a single
character no matter how many hexadecimal digits are
used).</p>

<p>0 the character whose value is 0</p>

<p>xy (where xy is exactly two octal digits, and is not a
back refer- ence (see below)) the character whose octal
value is 0xy</p>

<p>xyz (where xyz is exactly three octal digits, and is not
a back ref- erence (see below)) the character whose octal
value is 0xyz</p>

<p>Hexadecimal digits are 0-9, a-f, and A-F. Octal digits
are 0-7.</p>

<p>The character-entry escapes are always taken as ordinary
characters. For example, 135 is ] in Unicode, but135 does
not terminate a bracket expression. Beware, however, that
some applications (e.g., C compilers and the Tcl interpreter
if the regular expression is not quoted with braces)
interpret such sequences themselves before the reg-
ular-expression package gets to see them, which may require
doubling (quadrupling, etc.) the.</p>

<p>CLASS-SHORTHAND ESCAPES Class-shorthand escapes (AREs
only) provide shorthands for certain com- monly-used
character classes:</p>

<p>d [[:digit:]]</p>

<p>[[:space:]]</p>

<p>240[[:alnum:]_] (note underscore)</p>

<p>[^[:digit:]]</p>

<p>[^[:space:]]</p>

<p>W [^[:alnum:]_] (note underscore)</p>

<p>Within bracket expressions,d, , and 432 brackets, and,
andW are illegal. (So, for example, [a- d] is equivalent to
[a-c[:digit:]]. Also, [a-], which is equivalent to
[a-c^[:digit:]], is illegal.)</p>

<p>CONSTRAINT ESCAPES A constraint escape (AREs only) is a
constraint, matching the empty string if specific conditions
are met, written as an escape:</p>

<p>0MATCHING, below, for how this differs from ^)</p>

<p>m matches only at the beginning of a word</p>

<p>M matches only at the end of a word</p>

<p>y matches only at the beginning or end of a word</p>

<p>Y matches only at a point that is not the beginning or
end of a word</p>

<p>Z matchesbelow,onlyforat the end of the string (see
MATCHING, how this differs from $)</p>

<p>m (where m is a nonzero digit) a back reference, see
below</p>

<p>mnn (where m is a nonzero digit, and nn is some more
digits, and the decimal value mnn is not greater than the
number of closing capturing parentheses seen so far) a back
reference, see below</p>

<p>A word is defined as in the specification of [[:&lt;:]]
and [[:&gt;:]] above. Constraint escapes are illegal within
bracket expressions.</p>

<p>BACK REFERENCES A back reference (AREs only) matches the
same string matched by the parenthesized subexpression
specified by the number, so that (e.g.) ([bc]1 matches bb or
cc but not bc. The subexpression must entirely precede the
back reference in the RE. Subexpressions are num- bered in
the order of their leading parentheses. Non-capturing paren-
theses do not define subexpressions.</p>

<p>There is an inherent historical ambiguity between octal
character-entry escapes and back references, which is
resolved by heuristics, as hinted at above. A leading zero
always indicates an octal escape. A single non-zero digit,
not followed by another digit, is always taken as a back
reference. A multi-digit sequence not starting with a zero
is taken as a back reference if it comes after a suitable
subexpression (i.e. the number is in the legal range for a
back reference), and oth- erwise is taken as octal.</p>

<p>METASYNTAX In addition to the main syntax described
above, there are some special forms and miscellaneous
syntactic facilities available.</p>

<p>Normally the flavor of RE being used is specified by
application-depen- dent means. However, this can be
overridden by a director. If an RE of any flavor begins with
***:, the rest of the RE is an ARE. If an RE of any flavor
begins with ***=, the rest of the RE is taken to be a
literal string, with all characters considered ordinary
characters.</p>

<p>An ARE may begin with embedded options: a sequence
(?xyz) (where xyz is one or more alphabetic characters)
specifies options affecting the rest of the RE. These
supplement, and can override, any options specified by the
application. The available option letters are:</p>

<p>b rest of RE is a BRE</p>

<p>c case-sensitive matching (usual default)</p>

<p>e rest of RE is an ERE</p>

<p>i case-insensitive matching (see MATCHING, below)</p>

<p>m historical synonym for n</p>

<p>n newline-sensitive matching (see MATCHING, below)</p>

<p>p partial newline-sensitive matching (see MATCHING,
below)</p>

<p>q rest of RE is a literal (quoted) string, all ordinary
characters</p>

<p>s non-newline-sensitive matching (usual default)</p>

<p>t tight syntax (usual default; see below)</p>

<p>w inverse partial newline-sensitive ( weird ) matching
(see MATCH- ING, below)</p>

<p>x expanded syntax (see below)</p>

<p>Embedded options take effect at the ) terminating the
sequence. They are available only at the start of an ARE,
and may not be used later within it.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual (tight) RE syntax, in which all
characters are significant, there is an expanded syntax,
available in all flavors of RE with the -expanded switch, or
in AREs with the embedded x option. In the expanded syntax,
white-space characters are ignored and all charac- ters
between a # and the following newline (or the end of the RE)
are ignored, permitting paragraphing and commenting a
complex RE. There are three exceptions to that basic
rule:</p>

<p>&middot; a white-space character or # preceded by is
retained</p>

<p>&middot; white space or # within a bracket expression is
retained</p>

<p>&middot; white space and comments are illegal within
multi-character symbols like the ARE (?: or the BRE(</p>

<p>Expanded-syntax white-space characters are blank, tab,
newline, and any character that belongs to the space
character class.</p>

<p>Finally, in an ARE, outside bracket expressions, the
sequence (?#ttt) (where ttt is any text not containing a ))
is a comment, completely ignored. Again, this is not allowed
between the characters of multi- character symbols like (?:.
Such comments are more a historical artifact than a useful
facility, and their use is deprecated; use the expanded
syntax instead.</p>

<p>None of these metasyntax extensions is available if the
application (or an initial ***= director) has specified that
the user s input be treated as a literal string rather than
as an RE.</p>

<p>MATCHING In the event that an RE could match more than
one substring of a given string, the RE matches the one
starting earliest in the string. If the RE could match more
than one substring starting at that point, its choice is
determined by its preference: either the longest substring,
or the shortest.</p>

<p>Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference. A
parenthesized RE has the same preference (possibly none) as
the RE. A quantified atom with quantifier {m} or {m}? has
the same preference (possibly none) as the atom itself. A
quantified atom with other normal quantifiers (including
{m,n} with m equal to n) prefers longest match. A quantified
atom with other non-greedy quantifiers (including {m,n}?
with m equal to n) prefers shortest match. A branch has the
same preference as the first quantified atom in it which has
a preference. An RE consisting of two or more branches
connected by the | operator prefers longest match.</p>

<p>Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for
matching the whole RE, subexpressions also match the longest
or shortest possible sub- strings, based on their
preferences, with subexpressions starting ear- lier in the
RE taking priority over ones starting later. Note that outer
subexpressions thus take priority over their component
subexpres- sions.</p>

<p>Note that the quantifiers {1,1} and {1,1}? can be used
to force longest and shortest preference, respectively, on a
subexpression or a whole RE.</p>

<p>Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
elements. An empty string is considered longer than no match
at all. For example, bb* matches the three middle characters
of abbbc, (week|wee)(night|knights) matches all ten
characters of weeknights, when (.*).* is matched against abc
the parenthesized subexpression matches all three
characters, and when (a*)* is matched against bc both the
whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match an empty
string.</p>

<p>If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is
much as if all case distinctions had vanished from the
alphabet. When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases
appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket
expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket
expression containing both cases, so that x becomes [xX].
When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case
counterparts of it are added to the bracket expression, so
that [x] becomes [xX] and [^x] becomes [^xX].</p>

<p>If newline-sensitive matching is specified, . and
bracket expressions using ^ will never match the newline
character (so that matches will never cross newlines unless
the RE explicitly arranges it) and ^ and $ will match the
empty string after and before a newline respectively, in
addition to matching at beginning and end of string
respectively. ARE 0Z continue to match beginning or end of
string only.</p>

<p>If partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this
affects . and bracket expressions as with newline-sensitive
matching, but not ^ and $.</p>

<p>If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is
specified, this affects ^ and $ as with newline-sensitive
matching, but not . and bracket expressions. This is not
very useful but is provided for symme- try.</p>

<p>LIMITS AND COMPATIBILITY No particular limit is imposed
on the length of REs. Programs intended to be highly
portable should not employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as a
POSIX-compliant implementation can refuse to accept such
REs.</p>

<p>The only feature of AREs that is actually incompatible
with POSIX EREs is that does not lose its special
significance inside bracket expres- sions. All other ARE
features use syntax which is illegal or has unde- fined or
unspecified effects in POSIX EREs; the *** syntax of
directors likewise is outside the POSIX syntax for both BREs
and EREs.</p>

<p>Many of the ARE extensions are borrowed from Perl, but
some have been changed to clean them up, and a few Perl
extensions are not present. b Incompatibilities of note
include ,0 treatment for a trailing newline, the addition of
complemented bracket expressions to the things affected by
newline-sensitive matching, the restrictions on parentheses
and back references in lookahead con- straints, and the
longest/shortest-match (rather than first-match) matching
semantics.</p>

<p>The matching rules for REs containing both normal and
non-greedy quan- tifiers have changed since early beta-test
versions of this package. (The new rules are much simpler
and cleaner, but do not work as hard at guessing the users
real intentions.)</p>

<p>Henry Spencers original 1986 regexp package, still in
widespread use (e.g., in pre-8.1 releases of Tcl),
implemented an early version of todays EREs. There are four
incompatibilities between regexps near- EREs ( RREs for
short) and AREs. In roughly increasing order of sig-
nificance:</p>

<p>&middot; In AREs, followed by an alphanumeric character
is either an escape or an error, while in RREs, it was just
another way of writing the alphanumeric. This should not be
a problem because there was no rea- son to write such a
sequence in RREs.</p>

<p>&middot; { followed by a digit in an ARE is the
beginning of a bound, while in RREs, { was always an
ordinary character. Such sequences should be rare, and will
often result in an error because following charac- ters will
not look like a valid bound.</p>

<p>&middot; In AREs, remains a special character within []
, so a literal within [] must be written . \also gives a
literal within [] in RREs, but only truly paranoid
programmers routinely doubled the backslash.</p>

<p>&middot; AREs report the longest/shortest match for the
RE, rather than the first found in a specified search order.
This may affect some RREs which were written in the
expectation that the first match would be reported. (The
careful crafting of RREs to optimize the search order for
fast matching is obsolete (AREs examine all possible matches
in parallel, and their performance is largely insensitive to
their com- plexity) but cases where the search order was
exploited to deliber- ately find a match which was not the
longest/shortest will need rewriting.)</p>

<p>BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS BREs differ from EREs in
several respects. |, +, and ? are ordi- nary characters and
there is no equivalent for their functionality. The
delimiters for bounds ar{ an}, with { and } by themselves
ordi- nary characters. The parentheses for nested
subexpressions are ( and ) , with ( and ) by themselves
ordinary characters. ^ is an ordinary character except at
the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized
subexpression, $ is an ordinary character except at the end
of the RE or the end of a parenthesized subexpression, and *
is an ordinary character if it appears at the beginning of
the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression
(after a possible leading ^). Finally, single-digit back
references are available, and&lt; and &gt; are synonyms for
[[:&lt;:]] and [[:&gt;:]] respectively; no other escapes are
available.</p>
