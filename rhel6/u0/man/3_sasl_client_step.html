<p>NAME sasl_client_step - Perform a step in the
authentication negotiation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_client_step(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char
*serverin, unsigned serverinlen, sasl_interact_t **
prompt_need, const char ** clientout, unsigned *
clientoutlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_client_step() performs a step in the
authentication negotiation. It returns SASL_OK if the whole
negotiation is successful and SASL_CON- TINUE if this step
is ok but at least one more step is needed. A client should
not assume an authentication negotiation is successful just
because the server signaled success via protocol (i.e. if
the server said &quot;. OK Authentication succeeded&quot; in
IMAP sasl_client_step should still be called one more time
with a serverinlen of zero.</p>

<p>If SASL_INTERACT is returned the library needs some
values to be filled in before it can proceed. The
prompt_need structure will be filled in with requests. The
application should fulfill these requests and call
sasl_client_start again with identical parameters (the
prompt_need parameter will be the same pointer as before but
filled in by the application).</p>

<p>conn is the SASL connection context</p>

<p>serverin is the data given by the server (decoded if the
protocol encodes requests sent over the wire)</p>

<p>serverinlen is the length of serverin</p>

<p>clientout and clientoutlen is created. It is the initial
client response to send to the server. It is the job of the
client to send it over the network to the server. Any
protocol specific encoding (such as base64 encoding)
necessary needs to be done by the client.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sasl_client_step returns an integer which
corresponds to one of the following codes. SASL_CONTINUE
indicates success and that there are more steps needed in
the authentication. SASL_OK indicates that the
authentication is complete. All other return codes indicate
errors and should either be handled or the authentication
session should be quit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO RFC 2222</p>
