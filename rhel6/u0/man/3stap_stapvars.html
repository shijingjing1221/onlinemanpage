<p>NAME stapvars - systemtap variables</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The following sections enumerate the public
variables provided by stan- dard tapsets installed under
/usr/share/systemtap/tapset. Each vari- able is described
with a type, and its behavior/restrictions. The syn- tax is
the same as printed with the stap option -p2. Examples:</p>

<p>example1:long Variable &quot;example1&quot; contains an
integer.</p>

<p>example2:string [long] Variable &quot;example2&quot; is
an array of strings, indexed by integers.</p>

<p>ARGV argc:long Contains the value of the $# value: the
number of command line arguments passed to the systemtap
script. It is initialized with an implicit begin(-1)
probe.</p>

<p>argv:string [long] Contains each command line argument
as a string. argv[1] will equal @1 if there was at least one
command line argument. Argu- ments beyond #32 are not
transcribed, and produce a warning mes- sage within the
begin(-1) probe that initializes this array.</p>

<p>NULL NULL:long Simply defined as the number 0.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/systemtap/tapset</p>
