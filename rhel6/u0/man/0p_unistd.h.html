<p>&lt;unistd.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;unistd.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME unistd.h - standard symbolic constants and
types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;unistd.h&gt; header defines
miscellaneous symbolic constants and types, and declares
miscellaneous functions. The actual values of the constants
are unspecified except as shown. The contents of this header
are shown below.</p>

<p>Version Test Macros The following symbolic constants
shall be defined:</p>

<p>_POSIX_VERSION Integer value indicating version of IEEE
Std 1003.1 (C-language binding) to which the implementation
conforms. For implementa- tions conforming to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, the value shall be 200112L.</p>

<p>_POSIX2_VERSION Integer value indicating version of the
Shell and Utilities vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1 to which the
implementation conforms. For implementations conforming to
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the value shall be 200112L.</p>

<p>The following symbolic constant shall be defined only if
the implemen- tation supports the XSI option; see XSI
Conformance .</p>

<p>_XOPEN_VERSION</p>

<p>Integer value indicating version of the X/Open
Portability Guide to which the implementation conforms. The
value shall be 600.</p>

<p>Constants for Options and Option Groups The following
symbolic constants, if defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;, shall
have a value of -1, 0, or greater, unless otherwise
specified below. If these are undefined, the fpathconf(),
pathconf(), or sysconf() func- tions can be used to
determine whether the option is provided for a particular
invocation of the application.</p>

<p>If a symbolic constant is defined with the value -1, the
option is not supported. Headers, data types, and function
interfaces required only for the option need not be
supplied. An application that attempts to use anything
associated only with the option is considered to be
requiring an extension.</p>

<p>If a symbolic constant is defined with a value greater
than zero, the option shall always be supported when the
application is executed. All headers, data types, and
functions shall be present and shall operate as
specified.</p>

<p>If a symbolic constant is defined with the value zero,
all headers, data types, and functions shall be present. The
application can check at runtime to see whether the option
is supported by calling fpath- conf(), pathconf(), or
sysconf() with the indicated name parameter.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly specified otherwise, the behavior of
functions asso- ciated with an unsupported option is
unspecified, and an application that uses such functions
without first checking fpathconf(), path- conf(), or
sysconf() is considered to be requiring an extension.</p>

<p>For conformance requirements, refer to Conformance .</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 only describes
the behavior of systems that claim conformance to it.
However, application developers who want to write
applications that adapt to other versions of IEEE Std 1003.1
(or to systems that do not conform to any POSIX standard)
may find it useful to code them so as to conditionally
compile different code depending on the value of
_POSIX_VERSION, for example:</p>

<p>#if _POSIX_VERSION &gt;= 200112L /* Use the newer
function that copes with large files. */ off_t
pos=ftello(fp); #else /* Either this is an old version of
POSIX, or _POSIX_VERSION is not even defined, so use the
traditional function. */ long pos=ftell(fp); #endif</p>

<p>Earlier versions of IEEE Std 1003.1 and of the Single
UNIX Specifica- tion can be identified by the following
macros:</p>

<p>POSIX.1-1988 standard _POSIX_VERSION==198808L</p>

<p>POSIX.1-1990 standard _POSIX_VERSION==199009L</p>

<p>ISO POSIX-1:1996 standard _POSIX_VERSION==199506L</p>

<p>Single UNIX Specification, Version 1 _XOPEN_UNIX and
_XOPEN_VERSION==4</p>

<p>Single UNIX Specification, Version 2 _XOPEN_UNIX and
_XOPEN_VERSION==500</p>

<p>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not make any attempt to define
application binary interaction with the underlying operating
system. However, application developers may find it useful
to query _SC_VERSION at run- time via sysconf() to determine
whether the current version of the operating system supports
the necessary functionality as in the follow- ing program
fragment:</p>

<p>if (sysconf(_SC_VERSION) &lt; 200112L) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;POSIX.1-2001 system required, terminatingn&quot;);
exit(1); }</p>

<p>New applications should not use _XOPEN_SHM or
_XOPEN_ENH_I18N.</p>

<p>RATIONALE As IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 evolved, certain
options became sufficiently standardized that it was
concluded that simply requiring one of the option choices
was simpler than retaining the option. However, for
backwards-compatibility, the option flags (with required
constant val- ues) are retained.</p>

<p>Version Test Macros The standard developers considered
altering the definition of _POSIX_VERSION and removing
_SC_VERSION from the specification of sysconf() since the
utility to an application was deemed by some to be minimal,
and since the implementation of the functionality is poten-
tially problematic. However, they recognized that support
for existing application binaries is a concern to
manufacturers, application devel- opers, and the users of
implementations conforming to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>While the example using _SC_VERSION in the APPLICATION
USAGE section does not provide the greatest degree of
imaginable utility to the application developer or user, it
is arguably better than a core file or some other equally
obscure result. (It is also possible for imple- mentations
to encode and recognize application binaries compiled in
various POSIX.1-conforming environments, and modify the
semantics of the underlying system to conform to the
expectations of the applica- tion.) For the reasons outlined
in the preceding paragraphs and in the APPLICATION USAGE
section, the standard developers elected to retain the
_POSIX_VERSION and _SC_VERSION functionality.</p>

<p>Compile-Time Symbolic Constants for System-Wide Options
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 now includes support in certain areas
for the newly adopted policy governing options and
stubs.</p>

<p>This policy provides flexibility for implementations in
how they sup- port options. It also specifies how conforming
applications can adapt to different implementations that
support different sets of options. It allows the
following:</p>

<p>1. If an implementation has no interest in supporting an
option, it does not have to provide anything associated with
that option beyond the announcement that it does not support
it.</p>

<p>2. An implementation can support a partial or
incompatible version of an option (as a non-standard
extension) as long as it does not claim to support the
option.</p>

<p>3. An application can determine whether the option is
supported. A strictly conforming application must check this
announcement mecha- nism before first using anything
associated with the option.</p>

<p>There is an important implication of this policy. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 cannot dictate the behavior of interfaces
associated with an option when the implementation does not
claim to support the option. In par- ticular, it cannot
require that a function associated with an unsup- ported
option will fail if it does not perform as specified.
However, this policy does not prevent a standard from
requiring certain func- tions to always be present, but that
they shall always fail on some implementations. The
setpgid() function in the POSIX.1-1990 standard, for
example, is considered appropriate.</p>

<p>The POSIX standards include various options, and the
C-language binding support for an option implies that the
implementation must supply data types and function
interfaces. An application must be able to discover whether
the implementation supports each option.</p>

<p>Any application must consider the following three cases
for each option:</p>

<p>1. Option never supported.</p>

<p>The implementation advertises at compile time that the
option will never be supported. In this case, it is not
necessary for the implemen- tation to supply any of the data
types or function interfaces that are provided only as part
of the option. The implementation might provide data types
and functions that are similar to those defined by IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, but there is no guarantee for any particular
behavior.</p>

<p>2. Option always supported.</p>

<p>The implementation advertises at compile time that the
option will always be supported. In this case, all data
types and function inter- faces shall be available and shall
operate as specified.</p>

<p>3. Option might or might not be supported.</p>

<p>Some implementations might not provide a mechanism to
specify support of options at compile time. In addition, the
implementation might be unable or unwilling to specify
support or non-support at compile time. In either case, any
application that might use the option at runtime must be
able to compile and execute. The implementation must
provide, at compile time, all data types and function
interfaces that are neces- sary to allow this. In this
situation, there must be a mechanism that allows the
application to query, at runtime, whether the option is sup-
ported. If the application attempts to use the option when
it is not supported, the result is unspecified unless
explicitly specified other- wise in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>
