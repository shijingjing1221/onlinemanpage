<p>NAME aulast - a program similar to last</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aulast [ options ] [ user ] [ tty ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aulast is a program that prints out a
listing of the last logged in users similarly to the program
last and lastb. Aulast searches back through the audit logs
or the given audit log file and displays a list of all users
logged in (and out) based on the range of time in the audit
logs. Names of users and ttys can be given, in which case
aulast will show only those entries matching the arguments.
Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus aulast 0 is the same
as last tty0.</p>

<p>The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is
rebooted. Thus last reboot will show a log of all reboots
since the log file was cre- ated.</p>

<p>The main difference that a user will notice is that
aulast print events from oldest to newest, while last prints
records from newest to oldest. Also, the audit system is not
notified each time a tty or pty is allo- cated, so you may
not see quite as many records indicating users and their
ttys.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --bad Report on the bad logins.</p>

<p>--extract Write raw audit records used to create the
displayed report into a file aulast.log in the current
working directory.</p>

<p>-f file Use the file instead of the audit logs for
input.</p>

<p>--proof Print out the audit event serial numbers used to
determine the preceeding line of the report. A Serial number
of 0 is a place holder and not an actual event serial
number. The serial numbers can be used to examine the actual
audit records in more detail. Also an ausearch query is
printed that will let you find the audit records associated
with that session.</p>

<p>--stdin Take audit records from stdin.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see this months logins ausearch --start
this-month --raw | aulast --stdin</p>

<p>SEE ALSO last(1), lastb(1), ausearch(8),
aureport(8).</p>
