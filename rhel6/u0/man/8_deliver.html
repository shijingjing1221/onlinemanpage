<p>NAME deliver - deliver mail to an IMAP mailbox</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS deliver [ -C config-file ] [ -d ] [ -r address
] [ -f address ] [ -m mailbox ] [ -a auth-id ] [ -q ] [
userid ]... deliver [ -C config-file ] -l</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Deliver reads a message from the standard
input and delivers it to one or more IMAP mailboxes.</p>

<p>Deliver reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-d Ignored for compatability with /bin/mail.</p>

<p>-r address Insert a Return-Path: header containing
address</p>

<p>-f address Insert a Return-Path: header containing
address</p>

<p>-m mailbox Deliver to mailbox. If any userids are
specified, attempts to deliver to user.userid.mailbox for
each userid. If the ACL on any such mailbox does not grant
the sender the &quot;p&quot; right or if -m is not
specified, then delivers to the INBOX for the userid,
regardless of the ACL on the INBOX.</p>

<p>If no userids are specified, attempts to deliver to
mailbox. If the ACL on mailbox does not grant the sender the
&quot;p&quot; right, the delivery fails.</p>

<p>-a auth-id Specify the authorization id of the sender.
Defaults to &quot;anony- mous&quot;.</p>

<p>-q Deliver message even when receiving mailbox is over
quota.</p>

<p>-l Accept messages using the LMTP protocol.</p>

<p>NOTES Depending on the setting of reject8bit in
imapd.conf(5), deliver either rejects/accepts messages with
8-bit-set characters in the headers. If we accept messages
with 8-bit-set characters in the headers, then depending on
the setting of munge8bit, these characters are either left
un-touched or changed to X . This is because such characters
cant be interpreted since the character set is not known,
although some commu- nities not well-served by US-ASCII
assume that those characters can be used to represent
characters not present in US-ASCII.</p>

<p>A method for encoding 8-bit-set characters is provided
by RFC 2047.</p>
