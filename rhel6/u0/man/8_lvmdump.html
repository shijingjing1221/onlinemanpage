<p>NAME lvmdump - create lvm2 information dumps for
diagnostic purposes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvmdump [options] [-d directory]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvmdump is a tool to dump various
information concerning LVM2. By default, it creates a
tarball suitable for submission along with a problem
report.</p>

<p>The content of the tarball is as follows: - dmsetup info
- table of currently running processes - recent entries from
/var/log/messages (containing system messages) - complete
lvm configuration and cache (content of /etc/lvm) - list of
device nodes present under /dev - list of files present
/sys/block - list of files present
/sys/devices/virtual/block - if enabled with -m, metadata
dump will be also included - if enabled with -a, debug
output of vgscan, pvscan and list of all available volume
groups, physical volumes and logical volumes will be
included - if enabled with -c, cluster status info</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h print help message</p>

<p>-a advanced collection WARNING: if lvm is already hung,
then this script may hang as well if -a is used</p>

<p>-m gather LVM metadata from the PVs This option
generates a 1:1 dump of the metadata area from all PVs
visible to the system, which can cause the dump to increase
in size considerably. However, the metadata dump may
represent a valuable diagnostic resource.</p>

<p>-d directory dump into a directory instead of tarball By
default, lvmdump will produce a single compressed tarball
containing all the information. Using this option, it can be
instructed to only produce the raw dump tree, rooted in
direc- tory.</p>

<p>-c if clvmd is running, gather cluster data as well</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LVM_BINARY The LVM2 binary to use.
Defaults to &quot;lvm&quot;. Sometimes you might need to set
this to &quot;/sbin/lvm.static&quot;, for example.</p>

<p>DMSETUP_BINARY The dmsetup binary to use. Defaults to
&quot;dmsetup&quot;.</p>
