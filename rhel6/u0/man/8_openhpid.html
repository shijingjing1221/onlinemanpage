<p>openhpid(8) OpenHPI openhpid(8)</p>

<p>NAME openhpid - HPI instance to which multiple clients
can connect.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS openhpid -c config_file [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The OpenHPI daemon runs as a background
process and accepts connections from remote clients that
invoke HPI function calls. The daemon wraps the OpenHPI
library with a sockets-based API that is archicture neutral
for all types of clients.</p>

<p>When you run the daemon, the standard method for
locating the OpenHPI configuration file is used. However,
the daemon will accept a configuration file as a command
line option (-c) to override the default file.</p>

<p>A command option (-p) or environment variable determines
the port number the daemon will listen on for client
connections. The default port is 4743.</p>

<p>The daemon creates a PID file in the /var/run
subdirectory. This directory is only writable by the root
user. Thus the daemon will fail when run as a normal user if
the PID file location is not overridden. To override the PID
file location you can use the -f command line option.</p>

<p>The client and the daemon do not have to be on the same
hardware architecture. The daemon could be running on a
P-series processor and the client running on an x86-series
processor. The client library and daemon use a marshaling
technique to resolve architecture and structure padding
conflicts. The user does not need to concern themselves with
architectureal differences between the client and daemon.
The one exception to this rule is 64-bit architectures. The
client and daemon currently cannot resolve differences
between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f pidfile This overrides the default location
of the pidfile.</p>

<p>-n This forces the daemon to run in the foreground.</p>

<p>-p port This is used to override the port to listen on
by the daemon.</p>

<p>-s seconds Read timeout used by the daemon sockets.
Default is unlimited.</p>

<p>-t threads Sets the maximum number of connection
threads. Default is unlimited.</p>

<p>-v Display verbose messages</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES All of these environment
variables can instead be set in the openhpi.conf
configuration file, except for OPENHPI_DAEMON_PORT and
OPENHPI_CONF.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAEMON_PORT=PORT_NUMBER The port number the host
will listen on for clent connections. Default port is
4743.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_LOG_ON_SEV Valus can be one of:
CRITICAL,MAJOR,MINOR,INFORMATIONAL,OK,DEBUG. Events of this
severity or higher will be logged to the domain event log.
The default is MINOR.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_ON_EP=ENTITY_PATH Entity path returned (e.g.
{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}) when saHpiResourceIdGet() is called.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_EVT_QUEUE_LIMIT=NUMBER Maximum number of events
allowed in a subscribed sessions queue. Default is
10000.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DEL_SIZE_LIMIT=NUMBER Maximum number of events
allowed in the domain event log. Default is 10000</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DEL_SAVE Set to YES to persist the domain event
logs to disk. They will be loaded in case the daemon
restarts. Default is NO.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAT_SIZE_LIMIT=NUMBER Maximum number of alarms
allowed in the domain alarm table. Default is unlimited.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAT_USER_LIMIT=NUMBER Maximum number of user
alarms allowed in the domain alarm table. Default is
unlimited.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAT_SAVE Set to YES to persist the domain alarm
tables to disk. They will be loaded in case the daemon
restarts. Default is NO.</p>


<p>OPENHPI_PATH=&quot;/path/to/plugins:/another/path/to/plugins&quot;
This is a colon delimited list of directories used when
searching for an OpenHPI plugin to load. The default is
$prefix/lib/openhpi.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_VARPATH=&quot;/path/to/dir&quot; This sets the
directory used to store openhpi internal data. The domain
event logs and alarm tables are saved there (if configured
to) along with resource ID to entity path mappings. Default
is $prefix/var/lib/openhpi.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_CONF=&quot;/path/to/configurationg/file&quot;
This is another way of telling the daemon where to find the
configuration file.</p>
