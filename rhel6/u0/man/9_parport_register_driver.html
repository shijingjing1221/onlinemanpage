<p>PARPORT_REGISTER_DRI(9) Parallel Port Devices
PARPORT_REGISTER_DRI(9)</p>

<p>NAME parport_register_driver - register a parallel port
device driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int parport_register_driver(struct
parport_driver * drv);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS drv structure describing the driver</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This can be called by a parallel port device
driver in order to receive notifications about ports being
found in the system, as well as ports no longer
available.</p>

<p>The drv structure is allocated by the caller and must
not be deallocated until after calling
parport_unregister_driver.</p>

<p>The driver&acute;s attach function may block. The port
that attach is given will be valid for the duration of the
callback, but if the driver wants to take a copy of the
pointer it must call parport_get_port to do so. Calling
parport_register_device on that port will do this for
you.</p>

<p>The driver&acute;s detach function may block. The port
that detach is given will be valid for the duration of the
callback, but if the driver wants to take a copy of the
pointer it must call parport_get_port to do so.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success. Currently it always succeeds.</p>
