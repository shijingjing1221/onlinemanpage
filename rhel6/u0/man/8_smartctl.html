<p>SMARTCTL(8) 2010-01-28 SMARTCTL(8)</p>

<p>NAME smartctl - Control and Monitor Utility for SMART
Disks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smartctl [options] device</p>

<p>FULL PATH /usr/sbin/smartctl</p>

<p>PACKAGE VERSION smartmontools-5.39.1 released 2010-01-28
at 20:48:28</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION smartctl controls the Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technol- ogy (SMART) system built
into many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives.
The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the
hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out
different types of drive self-tests. This version of
smartctl is compatible with ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier
standards (see REFERENCES below)</p>

<p>smartctl is a command line utility designed to perform
SMART tasks such as printing the SMART self-test and error
logs, enabling and disabling SMART automatic testing, and
initiating device self-tests. Note: if the user issues a
SMART command that is (apparently) not implemented by the
device, smartctl will print a warning message but issue the
command anyway (see the -T, --tolerance option below). This
should not cause problems: on most devices, unimplemented
SMART commands issued to a drive are ignored and/or return
an error.</p>

<p>smartctl also provides support for polling TapeAlert
messages from SCSI tape drives and changers.</p>

<p>The user must specify the device to be controlled or
interrogated as the final argument to smartctl. The command
set used by the device is often derived from the device path
but may need help with the &acute;-d&acute; option (for more
information see the section on &quot;ATA, SCSI command sets
and SAT&quot; below). Device paths are as follows:</p>

<p>LINUX: Use the forms &quot;/dev/hd[a-t]&quot; for
IDE/ATA devices, and &quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; for SCSI
devices. For SCSI Tape Drives and Changers with TapeAlert
support use the devices &quot;/dev/nst*&quot; and
&quot;/dev/sg*&quot;. For SATA disks accessed with libata,
use &quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; and append &quot;-d ata&quot;.
For disks behind 3ware controllers you may need
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; or &quot;/dev/twe[0-9]&quot; or
&quot;/dev/twa[0-9]&quot;: see details below. For disks
behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may need
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;. For disks behind Areca SATA RAID
controllers, you need &quot;/dev/sg[2-9]&quot; (note that
smartmontools interacts with the Areca controllers via a
SCSI generic device which is different than the SCSI device
used for reading and writing data)!</p>

<p>DARWIN: Use the forms /dev/disk[0-9] or equivalently
disk[0-9] or equivalently /dev/rdisk[0-9]. Long forms are
also available: please use &acute;-h&acute; to see some
examples. Note that there is cur- rently no Darwin SCSI
support.</p>

<p>FREEBSD: Use the forms &quot;/dev/ad[0-9]+&quot; for
IDE/ATA devices and &quot;/dev/da[0-9]+&quot; for SCSI
devices.</p>

<p>NETBSD/OPENBSD: Use the form &quot;/dev/wd[0-9]+c&quot;
for IDE/ATA devices. For SCSI disk and tape devices, use the
device names &quot;/dev/sd[0-9]+c&quot; and
&quot;/dev/st[0-9]+c&quot; respectively. Be sure to specify
the correct &quot;whole disk&quot; partition letter for your
architecture.</p>

<p>SOLARIS: Use the forms &quot;/dev/rdsk/c?t?d?s?&quot;
for IDE/ATA and SCSI disk devices, and
&quot;/dev/rmt/*&quot; for SCSI tape devices.</p>

<p>WINDOWS 9x/ME: Use the forms &quot;/dev/hd[a-d]&quot;
for standard IDE/ATA devices accessed via SMARTVSD.VXD, and
&quot;/dev/hd[e-h]&quot; for additional devices accessed via
a patched SMARTVSE.VXD (see INSTALL file for details). Use
the form &quot;/dev/scsi[0-9][0-f]&quot; for SCSI devices
via an aspi dll on ASPI adapter 0-9, ID 0-15. The pre- fix
&quot;/dev/&quot; is optional.</p>

<p>WINDOWS NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista: Use the forms
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot; for IDE/(S)ATA and SCSI disks
&quot;\.PhysicalDrive[0-25]&quot; (where &quot;a&quot; maps
to &quot;0&quot;). These disks can also be referred to as
&quot;/dev/pd[0-255]&quot; for
&quot;\.PhysicalDrive[0-255]&quot;. ATA disks can also be
referred to as &quot;/dev/hd[a-z]&quot; for
&quot;\.PhysicalDrive[0-25]&quot;. Use one the forms
&quot;/dev/tape[0-255]&quot;, &quot;/dev/st[0-255]&quot;, or
&quot;/dev/nst[0-255]&quot; for SCSI tape drives
&quot;\.Tape[0-255]&quot;.</p>

<p>Alternatively, drive letters &quot;X:&quot; or &quot;X:
specify the (&acute;basic&acute;) disk behind a mounted
partition. This does not work with &acute;dynamic&acute;
disks.</p>

<p>For disks behind 3ware 9000 controllers use
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z],N&quot; where N specifies the disk number
(3ware &acute;port&acute;) behind the controller providing
the logical drive (&acute;unit&acute;) specified by
&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;. Alternatively, use
&quot;/dev/tw_cli/cx/py&quot; for controller x, port y to
run the &acute;tw_cli&acute; tool and parse the output. This
provides limited monitoring (&acute;-i&acute;,
&acute;-c&acute;, &acute;-A&acute; below) if SMART support
is missing in the driver. Use &quot;/dev/tw_cli/stdin&quot;
or &quot;/dev/tw_cli/clip&quot; to parse CLI or 3DM output
from standard input or clipboard. The option &acute;-d
3ware,N&acute; is not necessary on Windows. The prefix
&quot;/dev/&quot; is optional.</p>

<p>CYGWIN: See &quot;WINDOWS NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista&quot;
above.</p>

<p>OS/2,eComStation: Use the form &quot;/dev/hd[a-z]&quot;
for IDE/ATA devices.</p>

<p>if &acute;-&acute; is specified as the device path,
smartctl reads and interprets it s own debug output from
standard input. See &acute;-r ataioctl&acute; below for
details.</p>

<p>Based on the device path, smartctl will guess the device
type (ATA or SCSI). If necessary, the &acute;-d&acute;
option can be used to over-ride this guess</p>

<p>Note that the printed output of smartctl displays most
numerical values in base 10 (decimal), but some values are
displayed in base 16 (hex- adecimal). To distinguish them,
the base 16 values are always dis- played with a leading
&quot;0x&quot;, for example: &quot;0xff&quot;. This man page
follows the same convention.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options are grouped below into several
categories. smartctl will execute the corresponding commands
in the order: INFORMATION, ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA,
RUN/ABORT TESTS.</p>

<p>Long options are not supported on all systems. Use
&acute;smartctl -h&acute; to see the available options.</p>

<p>SHOW INFORMATION OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-h, --help, --usage Prints a usage message to STDOUT and
exits.</p>

<p>-V, --version, --copyright, --license Prints version,
copyright, license, home page and SVN revision information
for your copy of smartctl to STDOUT and then exits. Please
include this information if you are reporting bugs or
problems.</p>

<p>-i, --info Prints the device model number, serial
number, firmware version, and ATA Standard version/revision
information. Says if the device supports SMART, and if so,
whether SMART support is cur- rently enabled or disabled. If
the device supports Logical Block Address mode (LBA mode)
print current user drive capacity in bytes. (If drive is has
a user protected area reserved, or is &quot;clipped&quot;,
this may be smaller than the potential maximum drive
capacity.) Indicates if the drive is in the smartmontools
database (see &acute;-v&acute; options below). If so, the
drive model fam- ily may also be printed. If
&acute;-n&acute; (see below) is specified, the power mode of
the drive is printed.</p>

<p>-a, --all Prints all SMART information about the disk,
or TapeAlert infor- mation about the tape drive or changer.
For ATA devices this is equivalent to &acute;-H -i -c -A -l
error -l selftest -l selective&acute; and for SCSI, this is
equivalent to &acute;-H -i -A -l error -l selftest&acute;.
Note that for ATA disks this does not enable the non-SMART
options and the SMART options which require support for
48-bit ATA commands.</p>

<p>-x, --xall Prints all SMART and non-SMART information
about the device. For ATA devices this is equivalent to
&acute;-H -i -c -A -l xerror,error -l xselftest,selftest -l
selective -l directory -l scttemp -l sataphy&acute;. and for
SCSI, this is equivalent to &acute;-H -i -A -l error -l
selftest -l background -l sasphy&acute;.</p>

<p>RUN-TIME BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-q TYPE, --quietmode=TYPE Specifies that smartctl should
run in one of the two quiet modes described here. The valid
arguments to this option are:</p>

<p>errorsonly - only print: For the &acute;-l error&acute;
option, if nonzero, the number of errors recorded in the
SMART error log and the power-on time when they occurred;
For the &acute;-l selftest&acute; option, errors recorded in
the device self-test log; For the &acute;-H&acute; option,
SMART &quot;disk failing&quot; status or device Attributes
(pre-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past; For the &acute;-A&acute; option, device Attributes
(pre-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past.</p>

<p>silent - print no output. The only way to learn about
what was found is to use the exit status of smartctl (see
RETURN VALUES below).</p>

<p>noserial - Do not print the serial number of the
device.</p>

<p>-d TYPE, --device=TYPE Specifies the type of the device.
The valid arguments to this option are ata, scsi, sat,
marvell, 3ware,N, areca,N, usbcy- press, usbjmicron,
usbsunplus, cciss,N, hpt,L/M (or hpt,L/M/N), and test.</p>

<p>If this option is not used then smartctl will attempt to
guess the device type from the device name or from
controller type info provided by the operating system.</p>

<p>If &acute;test&acute; is used as the TYPE name, smartctl
prints the guessed TYPE name, then opens the device and
prints the (possibly changed) TYPE name and then exists
without performing any fur- ther commands.</p>

<p>The &acute;sat&acute; device type is for ATA disks that
have a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL) between
the disk and the operat- ing system. SAT defines two ATA
PASS THROUGH SCSI commands, one 12 bytes long and the other
16 bytes long that smartctl will utilize when this device
type is selected. The default is the 16 byte variant which
can be overridden with either &acute;-d sat,12&acute; or
&acute;-d sat,16&acute;.</p>

<p>The &acute;usbcypress&acute; device type is for ATA
disks that are behind a Cypress usb-pata bridge. This will
use the ATACB proprietary scsi pass through command. There
is no autodetection at the moment. The best way to know if
your device support it, is to check your device usb id (most
Cypress usb ata bridge got vid=0x04b4, pid=0x6830) or to try
it (if the usb device doesnt support ATACB, smartmontools
print an error). The default scsi operation code is 0x24,
but although it can be overridden with &acute;-d
usbcypress,0xn&acute;, where n is the scsi operation code,
youre running the risk of damage to the device or
filesystems on it.</p>

<p>[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The
&acute;usbjmicron&acute; device type is for SATA disks that
are behind a JMicron USB to PATA/SATA bridge. The 48-bit ATA
commands (required e.g. for &acute;-l xerror&acute;, see
below) do not work with all of these bridges and are there-
fore disabled by default. These commands can be enabled by
&acute;-d usbjmicron,x&acute;. CAUTION: Specifying
&acute;,x&acute; for a device which do not support it
results in I/O errors and may disconnect the drive. The port
can be specified by &acute;-d usbjmicron[,x],PORT&acute;
where PORT is 0 (master) or 1 (slave). This is not necessary
if only one disk is connected to the USB bridge. If two
disks are connected, an error message is printed if no PORT
is specified.</p>

<p>[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The
&acute;usbsunplus&acute; device type is for SATA disks that
are behind a SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.</p>

<p>Under Linux, to look at SATA disks behind Marvell SATA
con- trollers (using Marvells &acute;linuxIAL&acute; driver
rather than libata driver) use &acute;-d marvell&acute;.
Such controllers show up as Marvell Technology Group Ltd.
SATA I or II controllers using lspci, or using lspci -n show
a vendor ID 0x11ab and a device ID of either 0x5040, 0x5041,
0x5080, 0x5081, 0x6041 or 0x6081. The &acute;linuxIAL&acute;
driver seems not (yet?) available in the Linux kernel source
tree, but should be available from system vendors
(ftp://ftp.aslab.com/ is known to provide a patch with the
driver).</p>

<p>Under Linux , to look at SCSI/SAS disks behind LSI
MegaRAID controllers, use syntax such as: smartctl -a -d
megaraid,2 /dev/sda smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb where
in the argument megaraid,N, the integer N is the physical
disk number within the MegaRAID controller. This interface
will also work for Dell PERC controllers. The following
/dev/XXX entry must exist: For PERC2/3/4 controllers:
/dev/megadev0 For PERC5/6 controllers:
/dev/megaraid_sas_ioctl_node</p>

<p>Under Linux and FreeBSD, to look at ATA disks behind
3ware SCSI RAID controllers, use syntax such as: smartctl -a
-d 3ware,2 /dev/sda smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0
smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0 where in the argument
3ware,N, the integer N is the disk number (3ware
&acute;port&acute;) within the 3ware ATA RAID controller.
The allowed values of N are from 0 to 127 inclusive. The
first two forms, which refer to devices /dev/sda-z and
/dev/twe0-15, may be used with 3ware series 6000, 7000, and
8000 series con- trollers that use the 3x-xxxx driver. Note
that the /dev/sda-z form is deprecated starting with the
Linux 2.6 kernel series and may not be supported by the
Linux kernel in the near future. The final form, which
refers to devices /dev/twa0-15, must be used with 3ware 9000
series controllers, which use the 3w-9xxx driver.</p>

<p>Note that if the special character device nodes
/dev/twa? and /dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the
incorrect major or minor numbers, smartctl will recreate
them on the fly. Typi- cally /dev/twa0 refers to the first
9000-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second 9000
series controller, and so on. Likewise /dev/twe0 refers to
the first 6/7/8000-series con- troller, /dev/twa1 refers to
the second 6/7/8000 series con- troller, and so on.</p>

<p>Note that for the 6/7/8000 controllers, any of the
physical disks can be queried or examined using any of the
3wares SCSI logical device /dev/sd? entries. Thus, if
logical device /dev/sda is made up of two physical disks
(3ware ports zero and one) and logical device /dev/sdb is
made up of two other physi- cal disks (3ware ports two and
three) then you can examine the SMART data on any of the
four physical disks using either SCSI device /dev/sda or
/dev/sdb. If you need to know which logical SCSI device a
particular physical disk (3ware port) is associ- ated with,
use the dmesg or SYSLOG output to show which SCSI ID
corresponds to a particular 3ware unit, and then use the
3ware CLI or 3dm tool to determine which ports (physical
disks) corre- spond to particular 3ware units.</p>

<p>If the value of N corresponds to a port that does not
exist on the 3ware controller, or to a port that does not
physically have a disk attached to it, the behavior of
smartctl depends upon the specific controller model,
firmware, Linux kernel and platform. In some cases you will
get a warning message that the device does not exist. In
other cases you will be presented with &acute;void&acute;
data for a non-existent device.</p>

<p>Note that if the /dev/sd? addressing form is used, then
older 3w-xxxx drivers do not pass the &quot;Enable
Autosave&quot; (&acute;-S on&acute;) and &quot;Enable
Automatic Offline&quot; (&acute;-o on&acute;) commands to
the disk, and produce these types of harmless syslog error
messages instead: &quot;3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru size
(123392) too big&quot;. This can be fixed by upgrading to
version 1.02.00.037 or later of the 3w-xxxx driver, or by
applying a patch to older versions. See
http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/ for instructions.
Alter- natively, use the character device /dev/twe0-15
interface.</p>

<p>The selective self-test functions (&acute;-t
select,A-B&acute;) are only supported using the character
device interface /dev/twa0-15 and /dev/twe0-15. The
necessary WRITE LOG commands can not be passed through the
SCSI interface.</p>

<p>Areca SATA RAID controllers are currently supported
under Linux only. To look at SATA disks behind Areca RAID
controllers, use syntax such as: smartctl -a -d areca,2
/dev/sg2 smartctl -a -d areca,3 /dev/sg3 where in the
argument areca,N, the integer N is the disk number (Areca
&acute;port&acute;) within the Areca SATA RAID controller.
The allowed values of N are from 1 to 24 inclusive. The
first line above addresses the second disk on the first
Areca RAID con- troller. The second line addresses the third
disk on the second Areca RAID controller. To help identify
the correct device, use the command: cat
/proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices to show the
SCSI generic devices (one per line, starting with /dev/sg0).
The correct SCSI generic devices to address for
smartmontools are the ones with the type field equal to 3.
If the incorrect device is addressed, please read the
warning/error messages carefully. They should provide hints
about what devices to use.</p>

<p>Important: the Areca controller must have firmware
version 1.46 or later. Lower-numbered firmware versions will
give (harmless) SCSI error messages and no SMART
information.</p>

<p>To look at (S)ATA disks behind HighPoint RocketRAID
controllers, use syntax such as: smartctl -a -d hpt,1/3
/dev/sda (under Linux) smartctl -a -d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/sda
(under Linux) smartctl -a -d hpt,1/3 /dev/hptrr (under
FreeBSD) smartctl -a -d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/hptrr (under FreeBSD)
where in the argument hpt,L/M or hpt,L/M/N, the integer L is
the controller id, the integer M is the channel number, and
the integer N is the PMPort number if it is available. The
allowed values of L are from 1 to 4 inclusive, M are from 1
to 8 inclu- sive and N from 1 to 5 if PMPort available. Note
that the /dev/sda-z form should be the device node which
stands for the disks derived from the HighPoint RocketRAID
controllers under Linux and under FreeBSD, it is the
character device which the driver registered (eg,
/dev/hptrr, /dev/hptmv6). And also these values are limited
by the model of the HighPoint RocketRAID con- troller.</p>

<p>HighPoint RocketRAID controllers are currently ONLY
supported under Linux and FreeBSD.</p>

<p>cciss controllers are currently ONLY supported under
Linux and FreeBSD.</p>

<p>-T TYPE, --tolerance=TYPE [ATA only] Specifies how
tolerant smartctl should be of ATA and SMART command
failures.</p>

<p>The behavior of smartctl depends upon whether the
command is &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;mandatory&quot;.
Here &quot;mandatory&quot; means &quot;required by the
ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification if the device implements the SMART
command set&quot; and &quot;optional&quot; means &quot;not
required by the ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification even if the device
implements the SMART command set.&quot; The
&quot;mandatory&quot; ATA and SMART commands are: (1) ATA
IDENTIFY DEVICE, (2) SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE
AUTOSAVE, (3) SMART ENABLE/DISABLE, and (4) SMART RETURN
STATUS.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p>normal - exit on failure of any mandatory SMART command,
and ignore all failures of optional SMART commands. This is
the default. Note that on some devices, issuing
unimplemented optional SMART commands doesn&acute;t cause an
error. This can result in misleading smartctl messages such
as &quot;Feature X not imple- mented&quot;, followed shortly
by &quot;Feature X: enabled&quot;. In most such cases,
contrary to the final message, Feature X is not enabled.</p>

<p>conservative - exit on failure of any optional SMART
command.</p>

<p>permissive - ignore failure(s) of mandatory SMART
commands. This option may be given more than once. Each
additional use of this option will cause one more additional
failure to be ignored. Note that the use of this option can
lead to messages like &quot;Feature X not implemented&quot;,
followed shortly by &quot;Error: unable to enable Feature
X&quot;. In a few such cases, contrary to the final message,
Feature X is enabled.</p>

<p>verypermissive - equivalent to giving a large number of
&acute;-T per- missive&acute; options: ignore failures of
any number of mandatory SMART commands. Please see the note
above.</p>

<p>-b TYPE, --badsum=TYPE [ATA only] Specifies the action
smartctl should take if a check- sum error is detected in
the: (1) Device Identity Structure, (2) SMART Self-Test Log
Structure, (3) SMART Attribute Value Struc- ture, (4) SMART
Attribute Threshold Structure, or (5) ATA Error Log
Structure.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p>warn - report the incorrect checksum but carry on in
spite of it. This is the default.</p>

<p>exit - exit smartctl.</p>

<p>ignore - continue silently without issuing a
warning.</p>

<p>-r TYPE, --report=TYPE Intended primarily to help
smartmontools developers understand the behavior of
smartmontools on non-conforming or poorly con- forming
hardware. This option reports details of smartctl
transactions with the device. The option can be used
multiple times. When used just once, it shows a record of
the ioctl() transactions with the device. When used more
than once, the detail of these ioctl() transactions are
reported in greater detail. The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p>ioctl - report all ioctl() transactions.</p>

<p>ataioctl - report only ioctl() transactions with ATA
devices.</p>

<p>scsiioctl - report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI
devices. Invoking this once shows the SCSI commands in hex
and the corre- sponding status. Invoking it a second time
adds a hex listing of the first 64 bytes of data send to, or
received from the device.</p>

<p>Any argument may include a positive integer to specify
the level of detail that should be reported. The argument
should be fol- lowed by a comma then the integer with no
spaces. For example, ataioctl,2 The default level is 1, so
&acute;-r ataioctl,1&acute; and &acute;-r ataioctl&acute;
are equivalent.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, the output of &acute;-r
ataioctl,2&acute; can later be parsed by smartctl itself if
&acute;-&acute; is used as device path argu- ment. The ATA
command input parameters, sector data and return values are
reconstructed from the debug report read from stdin. Then
smartctl internally simulates an ATA device with the same
behaviour. This is does not work for SCSI devices yet.</p>

<p>-n POWERMODE, --nocheck=POWERMODE [ATA only] Specifies
if smartctl should exit before performing any checks when
the device is in a low-power mode. It may be used to prevent
a disk from being spun-up by smartctl. The power mode is
ignored by default. The allowed values of POWERMODE are:</p>

<p>never - check the device always, but print the power
mode if &acute;-i&acute; is specified.</p>

<p>sleep - check the device unless it is in SLEEP mode.</p>

<p>standby - check the device unless it is in SLEEP or
STANDBY mode. In these modes most disks are not spinning, so
if you want to prevent a disk from spinning up, this is
probably what you want.</p>

<p>idle - check the device unless it is in SLEEP, STANDBY
or IDLE mode. In the IDLE state, most disks are still
spinning, so this is probably not what you want.</p>

<p>SMART FEATURE ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS:</p>

<p>Note: if multiple options are used to both enable and
disable a feature, then both the enable and disable commands
will be issued. The enable command will always be issued
before the corresponding disable command.</p>

<p>-s VALUE, --smart=VALUE Enables or disables SMART on
device. The valid arguments to this option are on and off.
Note that the command &acute;-s on&acute; (per- haps used
with with the &acute;-o on&acute; and &acute;-S on&acute;
options) should be placed in a start-up script for your
machine, for example in rc.local or rc.sysinit. In principle
the SMART feature settings are preserved over power-cycling,
but it doesn&acute;t hurt to be sure. It is not necessary
(or useful) to enable SMART to see the TapeAlert
messages.</p>

<p>-o VALUE, --offlineauto=VALUE [ATA only] Enables or
disables SMART automatic offline test, which scans the drive
every four hours for disk defects. This command can be given
during normal system operation. The valid arguments to this
option are on and off.</p>

<p>Note that the SMART automatic offline test command is
listed as &quot;Obsolete&quot; in every version of the ATA
and ATA/ATAPI Specifica- tions. It was originally part of
the SFF-8035i Revision 2.0 specification, but was never part
of any ATA specification. However it is implemented and used
by many vendors. [Good docu- mentation can be found in
IBM&acute;s Official Published Disk Specifi- cations. For
example the IBM Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive
Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22 April 2002, Publication #
1541, Document S07N-7715-02) page 164. You can also read the
SFF-8035i Specification -- see REFERENCES below.] You can
tell if auto- matic offline testing is supported by seeing
if this command enables and disables it, as indicated by the
&acute;Auto Offline Data Collection&acute; part of the SMART
capabilities report (displayed with &acute;-c&acute;).</p>

<p>SMART provides three basic categories of testing. The
first category, called &quot;online&quot; testing, has no
effect on the perfor- mance of the device. It is turned on
by the &acute;-s on&acute; option.</p>

<p>The second category of testing is called
&quot;offline&quot; testing. This type of test can, in
principle, degrade the device performance. The &acute;-o
on&acute; option causes this offline testing to be carried
out, automatically, on a regular scheduled basis. Normally,
the disk will suspend offline testing while disk accesses
are taking place, and then automatically resume it when the
disk would oth- erwise be idle, so in practice it has little
effect. Note that a one-time offline test can also be
carried out immediately upon receipt of a user command. See
the &acute;-t offline&acute; option below, which causes a
one-time offline test to be carried out immedi- ately.</p>

<p>The choice (made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification
authors) of the word testing for these first two categories
is unfortu- nate, and often leads to confusion. In fact
these first two categories of online and offline testing
could have been more accurately described as online and
offline data collection.</p>

<p>The results of this automatic or immediate offline
testing (data collection) are reflected in the values of the
SMART Attributes. Thus, if problems or errors are detected,
the values of these Attributes will go below their failure
thresholds; some types of errors may also appear in the
SMART error log. These are visible with the &acute;-A&acute;
and &acute;-l error&acute; options respectively.</p>

<p>Some SMART attribute values are updated only during
off-line data collection activities; the rest are updated
during normal operation of the device or during both normal
operation and off-line testing. The Attribute value table
produced by the &acute;-A&acute; option indicates this in
the UPDATED column. Attributes of the first type are labeled
&quot;Offline&quot; and Attributes of the sec- ond type are
labeled &quot;Always&quot;.</p>

<p>The third category of testing (and the only category for
which the word &acute;testing&acute; is really an
appropriate choice) is &quot;self&quot; testing. This third
type of test is only performed (immedi- ately) when a
command to run it is issued. The &acute;-t&acute; and
&acute;-X&acute; options can be used to carry out and abort
such self-tests; please see below for further details.</p>

<p>Any errors detected in the self testing will be shown in
the SMART self-test log, which can be examined using the
&acute;-l self- test&acute; option.</p>

<p>Note: in this manual page, the word &quot;Test&quot; is
used in connection with the second category just described,
e.g. for the &quot;offline&quot; testing. The words
&quot;Self-test&quot; are used in connection with the third
category.</p>

<p>-S VALUE, --saveauto=VALUE Enables or disables SMART
autosave of device vendor-specific Attributes. The valid
arguments to this option are on and off. Note that this
feature is preserved across disk power cycles, so you should
only need to issue it once.</p>

<p>For SCSI devices this toggles the value of the Global
Logging Target Save Disabled (GLTSD) bit in the Control Mode
Page. Some disk manufacturers set this bit by default. This
prevents error counters, power-up hours and other useful
data from being placed in non-volatile storage, so these
values may be reset to zero the next time the device is
power-cycled. If the GLTSD bit is set then &acute;smartctl
-a&acute; will issue a warning. Use on to clear the GLTSD
bit and thus enable saving counters to non-volatile stor-
age. For extreme streaming-video type applications you might
consider using off to set the GLTSD bit.</p>

<p>SMART READ AND DISPLAY DATA OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-H, --health Check: Ask the device to report its SMART
health status or pend- ing TapeAlert messages. SMART status
is based on information that it has gathered from online and
offline tests, which were used to determine/update its SMART
vendor-specific Attribute values. TapeAlert status is
obtained by reading the TapeAlert log page.</p>

<p>If the device reports failing health status, this means
either that the device has already failed, or that it is
predicting its own failure within the next 24 hours. If this
happens, use the &acute;-a&acute; option to get more
information, and get your data off the disk and to someplace
safe as soon as you can.</p>

<p>-c, --capabilities [ATA only] Prints only the generic
SMART capabilities. These show what SMART features are
implemented and how the device will respond to some of the
different SMART commands. For example it shows if the device
logs errors, if it supports offline surface scanning, and so
on. If the device can carry out self-tests, this option also
shows the estimated time required to run those tests.</p>

<p>Note that the time required to run the Self-tests
(listed in minutes) are fixed. However the time required to
run the Imme- diate Offline Test (listed in seconds) is
variable. This means that if you issue a command to perform
an Immediate Offline test with the &acute;-t offline&acute;
option, then the time may jump to a larger value and then
count down as the Immediate Offline Test is car- ried out.
Please see REFERENCES below for further information about
the the flags and capabilities described by this option.</p>

<p>-A, --attributes [ATA] Prints only the vendor specific
SMART Attributes. The Attributes are numbered from 1 to 253
and have specific names and ID numbers. For example
Attribute 12 is &quot;power cycle count&quot;: how many
times has the disk been powered up.</p>

<p>Each Attribute has a &quot;Raw&quot; value, printed
under the heading &quot;RAW_VALUE&quot;, and a
&quot;Normalized&quot; value printed under the heading
&quot;VALUE&quot;. [Note: smartctl prints these values in
base-10.] In the example just given, the &quot;Raw
Value&quot; for Attribute 12 would be the actual number of
times that the disk has been power-cycled, for example 365
if the disk has been turned on once per day for exactly one
year. Each vendor uses their own algorithm to convert this
&quot;Raw&quot; value to a &quot;Normalized&quot; value in
the range from 1 to 254. Please keep in mind that smartctl
only reports the different Attribute types, values, and
thresholds as read from the device. It does not carry out
the conversion between &quot;Raw&quot; and
&quot;Normalized&quot; values: this is done by the
disk&acute;s firmware.</p>

<p>The conversion from Raw value to a quantity with
physical units is not specified by the SMART standard. In
most cases, the val- ues printed by smartctl are sensible.
For example the tempera- ture Attribute generally has its
raw value equal to the tempera- ture in Celsius. However in
some cases vendors use unusual con- ventions. For example
the Hitachi disk on my laptop reports its power-on hours in
minutes, not hours. Some IBM disks track three temperatures
rather than one, in their raw values. And so on.</p>

<p>Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range
is 0 to 255) which is printed under the heading
&quot;THRESH&quot;. If the Nor- malized value is less than
or equal to the Threshold value, then the Attribute is said
to have failed. If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute,
then disk failure is imminent.</p>

<p>Each Attribute also has a &quot;Worst&quot; value shown
under the heading &quot;WORST&quot;. This is the smallest
(closest to failure) value that the disk has recorded at any
time during its lifetime when SMART was enabled. [Note
however that some vendors firmware may actu- ally increase
the &quot;Worst&quot; value for some &quot;rate-type&quot;
Attributes.]</p>

<p>The Attribute table printed out by smartctl also shows
the &quot;TYPE&quot; of the Attribute. Attributes are one of
two possible types: Pre-failure or Old age. Pre-failure
Attributes are ones which, if less than or equal to their
threshold values, indicate pending disk failure. Old age, or
usage Attributes, are ones which indicate end-of-product
life from old-age or normal aging and wearout, if the
Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.
Please note: the fact that an Attribute is of type Pre-fail
does not mean that your disk is about to fail! It only has
this meaning if the Attribute&acute;s current Normalized
value is less than or equal to the threshold value.</p>

<p>If the Attribute&acute;s current Normalized value is
less than or equal to the threshold value, then the
&quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column will display
&quot;FAILING_NOW&quot;. If not, but the worst recorded
value is less than or equal to the threshold value, then
this column will display &quot;In_the_past&quot;. If the
&quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column has no entry (indicated by a
dash: &acute;-&acute;) then this Attribute is OK now (not
failing) and has also never failed in the past.</p>

<p>The table column labeled &quot;UPDATED&quot; shows if
the SMART Attribute values are updated during both normal
operation and off-line testing, or only during offline
testing. The former are labeled &quot;Always&quot; and the
latter are labeled &quot;Offline&quot;.</p>

<p>So to summarize: the Raw Attribute values are the ones
that might have a real physical interpretation, such as
&quot;Temperature Celsius&quot;, &quot;Hours&quot;, or
&quot;Start-Stop Cycles&quot;. Each manufacturer converts
these, using their detailed knowledge of the disk&acute;s
operations and failure modes, to Normalized Attribute values
in the range 1-254. The current and worst (lowest measured)
of these Normalized Attribute values are stored on the disk,
along with a Threshold value that the manufacturer has
determined will indicate that the disk is going to fail, or
that it has exceeded its design age or aging limit. smartctl
does not calculate any of the Attribute values, thresholds,
or types, it merely reports them from the SMART data on the
device.</p>

<p>Note that starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the
meaning of these Attribute fields has been made entirely
vendor-specific. However most ATA/ATAPI-5 disks seem to
respect their meaning, so we have retained the option of
printing the Attribute values.</p>

<p>[SCSI] For SCSI devices the &quot;attributes&quot; are
obtained from the temperature and start-stop cycle counter
log pages. Certain ven- dor specific attributes are listed
if recognised. The attributes are output in a relatively
free format (compared with ATA disk attributes).</p>

<p>-l TYPE, --log=TYPE Prints either the SMART Error Log,
the SMART Self-Test Log, the SMART Selective Self-Test Log
[ATA only], the Log Directory [ATA only], or the Background
Scan Results Log [SCSI only]. The valid arguments to this
option are:</p>

<p>error - [ATA] prints the Summary SMART error log. SMART
disks maintain a log of the most recent five non-trivial
errors. For each of these errors, the disk power-on lifetime
at which the error occurred is recorded, as is the device
status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of the error. For
some common types of errors, the Error Register (ER) and
Status Register (SR) val- ues are decoded and printed as
text. The meanings of these are: ABRT: Command ABoRTed AMNF:
Address Mark Not Found CCTO: Command Completion Timed Out
EOM: End Of Media ICRC: Interface Cyclic Redundancy Code
(CRC) error IDNF: IDentity Not Found ILI: (packet
command-set specific) MC: Media Changed MCR: Media Change
Request NM: No Media obs: obsolete TK0NF: TracK 0 Not Found
UNC: UNCorrectable Error in Data WP: Media is Write
Protected In addition, up to the last five commands that
preceded the error are listed, along with a timestamp
measured from the start of the corresponding power cycle.
This is displayed in the form Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is
the number of days, HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is
seconds and msec is milliseconds. [Note: this time stamp
wraps after 2^32 milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes
and 47.296 seconds.] The key ATA disk registers are also
recorded in the log. The final column of the error log is a
text-string description of the ATA command defined by the
Com- mand Register (CR) and Feature Register (FR) values.
Commands that are obsolete in the most current (ATA-7) spec
are listed like this: READ LONG (w/ retry) [OBS-4],
indicating that the command became obsolete with or in the
ATA-4 specification. Similarly, the notation [RET-N] is used
to indicate that a com- mand was retired in the ATA-N
specification. Some commands are not defined in any version
of the ATA specification but are in common use nonetheless;
these are marked [NS], meaning non-stan- dard.</p>

<p>The ATA Specification (ATA-5 Revision 1c, Section
8.41.6.8.2) says: &quot;Error log structures shall include
UNC errors, IDNF errors for which the address requested was
valid, servo errors, write fault errors, etc. Error log data
structures shall not include errors attributed to the
receipt of faulty commands such as command codes not
implemented by the device or requests with invalid
parameters or invalid addresses.&quot; The definitions of
these terms are: UNC (UNCorrectable): data is uncorrectable.
This refers to data which has been read from the disk, but
for which the Error Checking and Correction (ECC) codes are
inconsistent. In effect, this means that the data can not be
read. IDNF (ID Not Found): user-accessible address could not
be found. For READ LOG type commands, IDNF can also indicate
that a device data log structure checksum was incorrect.</p>

<p>If the command that caused the error was a READ or WRITE
com- mand, then the Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the
error occurred will be printed in base 10 and base 16. The
LBA is a linear address, which counts 512-byte sectors on
the disk, starting from zero. (Because of the limitations of
the SMART error log, if the LBA is greater than 0xfffffff,
then either no error log entry will be made, or the error
log entry will have an incorrect LBA. This may happen for
drives with a capacity greater than 128 GiB or 137 GB.) On
Linux systems the smartmontools web page has instructions
about how to convert the LBA address to the name of the disk
file containing the erro- neous disk sector.</p>

<p>Please note that some manufacturers ignore the ATA
specifica- tions, and make entries in the error log if the
device receives a command which is not implemented or is not
valid.</p>

<p>error - [SCSI] prints the error counter log pages for
reads, write and verifies. The verify row is only output if
it has an element other than zero.</p>

<p>xerror[,NUM][,error] - [ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL
SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints the Extended Comprehensive SMART
error log (Gen- eral Purpose Log address 0x03). Unlike the
Summary SMART error log (see &acute;-l error&acute; above),
it provides sufficient space to log the contents of the
48-bit LBA register set introduced with ATA-6. It also
supports logs with more than one sector. Each sector holds
up to 4 log entries. The actual number of log sec- tors is
vendor specific, typical values for HDD are 2 (Samsung), 5
(Seagate) or 6 (WD). Some recent SSD devices have much
larger error logs.</p>

<p>Only the 8 most recent error log entries are printed by
default. This number can be changed by the optional
parameter NUM.</p>

<p>If ,error is appended and the Extended Comprehensive
SMART error log is not supported, the Summary SMART
self-test log is printed.</p>

<p>Please note that some recent (e.g. Samsung) drives
report errors only in the Comprehensive SMART error log. The
Summary SMART error log can be read but is always empty.</p>

<p>selftest - [ATA] prints the SMART self-test log. The
disk main- tains a self-test log showing the results of the
self tests, which can be run using the &acute;-t&acute;
option described below. For each of the most recent
twenty-one self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short
or extended, off-line or captive) and the final status of
the test. If the test did not complete success- fully, then
the percentage of the test remaining is shown. The time at
which the test took place, measured in hours of disk
lifetime, is also printed. [Note: this time stamp wraps
after 2^16 hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5
years.] If any errors were detected, the Logical Block
Address (LBA) of the first error is printed in decimal
notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools web page has
instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the
name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.</p>

<p>selftest - [SCSI] the self-test log for a SCSI device
has a slightly different format than for an ATA device. For
each of the most recent twenty self-tests, it shows the type
of test and the status (final or in progress) of the test.
SCSI standards use the terms &quot;foreground&quot; and
&quot;background&quot; (rather than ATA&acute;s
corresponding &quot;captive&quot; and &quot;off-line&quot;)
and &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; (rather than
ATA&acute;s corresponding &quot;short&quot; and
&quot;extended&quot;) to describe the type of the test. The
printed segment number is only relevant when a test fails in
the third or later test seg- ment. It identifies the test
that failed and consists of either the number of the segment
that failed during the test, or the number of the test that
failed and the number of the segment in which the test was
run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both numbers
into a single byte. The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
first error is printed in hexadecimal nota- tion. On Linux
systems the smartmontools web page has instruc- tions about
how to convert this LBA address to the name of the disk file
containing the erroneous block. If provided, the SCSI Sense
Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense
Code Qualifier (ASQ) are also printed. The self tests can be
run using the &acute;-t&acute; option described below (using
the ATA test termi- nology).</p>

<p>xselftest[,NUM][,selftest] - [ATA only] [NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints the Extended SMART
self-test log (Gen- eral Purpose Log address 0x07). Unlike
the SMART self-test log (see &acute;-l selftest&acute;
above), it supports 48-bit LBA and logs with more than one
sector. Each sector holds up to 19 log entries. The actual
number of log sectors is vendor specific, typical values are
1 (Seagate) or 2 (Samsung).</p>

<p>Only the 25 most recent log entries are printed by
default. This number can be changed by the optional
parameter NUM.</p>

<p>If ,selftest is appended and the Extended SMART
self-test log is not supported, the old SMART self-test log
is printed.</p>

<p>selective - [ATA only] Please see the &acute;-t
select&acute; option below for a description of selective
self-tests. The selective self-test log shows the start/end
Logical Block Addresses (LBA) of each of the five test
spans, and their current test status. If the span is being
tested or the remainder of the disk is being read-scanned,
the current 65536-sector block of LBAs being tested is also
displayed. The selective self-test log also shows if a
read-scan of the remainder of the disk will be car- ried out
after the selective self-test has completed (see &acute;-t
afterselect&acute; option) and the time delay before
restarting this read-scan if it is interrupted (see
&acute;-t pending&acute; option). This is a new
smartmontools feature; please report unusual or incor- rect
behavior to the smartmontools-support mailing list.</p>

<p>directory[,gs] - [ATA only] if the device supports the
General Purpose Logging feature set (ATA-6 and above) then
this prints the Log Directory (the log at address 0). The
Log Directory shows what logs are available and their length
in sectors (512 bytes). The contents of the logs at address
1 [Summary SMART error log] and at address 6 [SMART
self-test log] may be printed using the previously-described
error and selftest arguments to this option. If your version
of smartctl supports 48-bit ATA commands, both the General
Purpose Log (GPL) and SMART Log (SL) directories are printed
in one combined table. The output can be restricted to the
GPL directory or SL directory by &acute;-l direc-
tory,q&acute; or &acute;-l directory,s&acute;
respectively.</p>

<p>background - [SCSI only] the background scan results log
outputs information derived from Background Media Scans
(BMS) done after power up and/or periodocally (e.g. every 24
hours) on recent SCSI disks. If supported, the BMS status is
output first, indi- cating whether a background scan is
currently underway (and if so a progress percentage), the
amount of time the disk has been powered up and the number
of scans already completed. Then there is a header and a
line for each background scan &quot;event&quot;. These will
typically be either recovered or unrecoverable errors. That
latter group may need some attention. There is a description
of the background scan mechansim in section 4.18 of SBC-3
revision 6 (see www.t10.org ).</p>

<p>scttemp, scttempsts, scttemphist - [ATA only] prints the
disk temperature information provided by the SMART Command
Transport (SCT) commands. The option
&acute;scttempsts&acute; prints current tempera- ture and
temperature ranges returned by the SCT Status command,
&acute;scttemphist&acute; prints temperature limits and the
temperature his- tory table returned by the SCT Data Table
command, and &acute;scttemp&acute; prints both. The
temperature values are preserved across power cycles. The
default temperature logging interval is 1 minute and can be
configured with the &acute;-t scttempint,N[,p]&acute;
option, see below. The SCT commands are specified in the
proposed ATA-8 Command Set (ACS), and are already
implemented in some recent ATA-7 disks.</p>

<p>sataphy[,reset] - [SATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL
FEA- TURE] prints values and descriptions of the SATA Phy
Event Coun- ters (General Purpose Log address 0x11). If
&acute;-l sataphy,reset&acute; is specified, all counters
are reset after reading the values.</p>

<p>sasphy[,reset] - [SAS (SCSI) only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL
SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints values and descriptions of the SAS
(SSP) Proto- col Specific log page (log page 0x18). If
&acute;-l sasphy,reset&acute; is specified, all counters are
reset after reading the values.</p>

<p>gplog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]] - [ATA only] [NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints a hex dump of any log
accessible via General Purpose Logging (GPL) feature. The
log address ADDR is the hex address listed in the log
directory (see &acute;-l directory&acute; above). The range
of log sectors (pages) can be specified by decimal values
FIRST-LAST or FIRST+SIZE. FIRST defaults to 0, SIZE defaults
to 1. LAST can be set to &acute;max&acute; to specify the
last page of the log.</p>

<p>smartlog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]] - [ATA only] [NEW
EXPERIMEN- TAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints a hex dump of any
log accessible via SMART Read Log command. See &acute;-l
gplog,...&acute; above for parame- ter syntax.</p>

<p>For example, all these commands: smartctl -l
gplog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda smartctl -l gplog,0x80,10+6
/dev/sda smartctl -l smartlog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda print
pages 10-15 of log 0x80 (first host vendor specific
log).</p>

<p>The hex dump format is compatible with the &acute;xxd
-r&acute; command. This command: smartctl -l gplog,0x11
/dev/sda | grep ^0 | xxd -r &gt;log.bin writes a binary
representation of the one sector log 0x11 (SATA Phy Event
Counters) to file log.bin.</p>

<p>-v ID,FORMAT[,NAME], --vendorattribute=ID,FORMAT[,NAME]
[ATA only] Sets a vendor-specific raw value print FORMAT and
optional NAME for Attribute ID. This option may be used
multi- ple times.</p>

<p>The Attribute ID can be in the range 1 to 255. If
&acute;N&acute; is speci- fied as ID, the settings for all
Attributes are changed. The NAME is a string of letters,
digits and underscore.</p>

<p>-v help - Prints (to STDOUT) a list of all valid
arguments to this option, then exits.</p>

<p>Valid arguments for FORMAT are:</p>

<p>raw8 - Print the Raw value as six 8-bit unsigned base-10
inte- gers. This may be useful for decoding the meaning of
the Raw value.</p>

<p>raw16 - Print the Raw value as three 16-bit unsigned
base-10 integers. This may be useful for decoding the
meaning of the Raw value.</p>

<p>raw48 - Print the Raw value as a 48-bit unsigned base-10
inte- ger. This is the default for most attributes.</p>

<p>hex48 - Print the Raw value as a 12 digit hexadecimal
number. This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the
Raw value.</p>

<p>raw64 - Print the Raw value as a 64-bit unsigned base-10
inte- ger. This includes two bytes from the normalized and
worst attribute value. This new raw format is used by some
recent SSD devices.</p>

<p>hex64 - Print the Raw value as a 16 digit hexadecimal
number. This includes two bytes from the normalized and
worst attribute value. This new raw format is used by some
recent SSD devices.</p>

<p>min2hour - Raw Attribute is power-on time in minutes.
Its raw value will be displayed in the form
&quot;Xh+Ym&quot;. Here X is hours, and Y is minutes in the
range 0-59 inclusive. Y is always printed with two digits,
for example &quot;06&quot; or &quot;31&quot; or
&quot;00&quot;.</p>

<p>sec2hour - Raw Attribute is power-on time in seconds.
Its raw value will be displayed in the form
&quot;Xh+Ym+Zs&quot;. Here X is hours, Y is minutes in the
range 0-59 inclusive, and Z is sec- onds in the range 0-59
inclusive. Y and Z are always printed with two digits, for
example &quot;06&quot; or &quot;31&quot; or
&quot;00&quot;.</p>

<p>halfmin2hour - Raw Attribute is power-on time, measured
in units of 30 seconds. This format is used by some Samsung
disks. Its raw value will be displayed in the form
&quot;Xh+Ym&quot;. Here X is hours, and Y is minutes in the
range 0-59 inclusive. Y is always printed with two digits,
for example &quot;06&quot; or &quot;31&quot; or
&quot;00&quot;.</p>

<p>tempminmax - Raw Attribute is the disk temperature in
Celsius. Info about Lifetime Min/Max temperature is printed
if available. This is the default for Attributes 190 and
194.</p>

<p>temp10x - Raw Attribute is ten times the disk
temperature in Celsius.</p>

<p>raw16(raw16) - Print the raw attribute as a 16-bit value
and two optional 16-bit values if these words are nonzero.
This is the default for Attributes 5 and 196.</p>

<p>raw16(avg16) - Raw attribute is spin-up time. It is
printed as a 16-bit value and an optional
&quot;Average&quot; 16-bit value if the word is nonzero.
This is the default for Attribute 3.</p>

<p>raw24/raw24 - Raw Attribute contains two 24-bit values.
The first is the number of load cycles. The second is the
number of unload cycles. The difference between these two
values is the number of times that the drive was
unexpectedly powered off (also called an emergency unload).
As a rule of thumb, the mechanical stress created by one
emergency unload is equivalent to that created by one
hundred normal unloads.</p>

<p>The following old arguments to &acute;-v&acute; are also
still valid:</p>

<p>9,minutes - same as: 9,min2hour,Power_On_Minutes.</p>

<p>9,seconds - same as: 9,sec2hour,Power_On_Seconds.</p>

<p>9,halfminutes - same as:

<p>9,temp - same as: 9,tempminmax,Temperature_Celsius.</p>

<p>192,emergencyretractcyclect - same as:
192,raw48,Emerg_Retract_Cycle_Ct</p>

<p>193,loadunload - same as: 193,raw24/raw24.</p>

<p>194,10xCelsius - same as:
194,temp10x,Temperature_Celsius_x10.</p>

<p>194,unknown - same as: 194,raw48,Unknown_Attribute.</p>

<p>197,increasing - same as:
197,raw48,Total_Pending_Sectors. Also means that Attribute
number 197 (Current Pending Sector Count) is not reset if
uncorrectable sectors are reallocated (see smartd.conf(5)
man page).</p>

<p>198,increasing - same as:
198,raw48,Total_Offl_Uncorrectabl. Also means that Attribute
number 198 (Offline Uncorrectable Sec- tor Count) is not
reset if uncorrectable sectors are reallocated (see
smartd.conf(5) man page).</p>

<p>198,offlinescanuncsectorct - same as:

<p>-F TYPE, --firmwarebug=TYPE [ATA only] Modifies the
behavior of smartctl to compensate for some known and
understood device firmware or driver bug. Except
&acute;swapid&acute;, the arguments to this option are
exclusive, so that only the final option given is used. The
valid values are:</p>

<p>none - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA
specifica- tions. This is the default, unless the device has
presets for &acute;-F&acute; in the device database (see
note below).</p>

<p>samsung - In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H
Firmware Version: RM100-08) some of the two- and four-byte
quantities in the SMART data structures are byte-swapped
(relative to the ATA specification). Enabling this option
tells smartctl to evaluate these quantities in byte-reversed
order. Some signs that your disk needs this option are (1)
no self-test log printed, even though you have run
self-tests; (2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in
the ATA error log; (3) strange and impossible values for the
ATA error log timestamps.</p>

<p>samsung2 - In more recent Samsung disks (firmware
revisions end- ing in &quot;-23&quot;) the number of ATA
errors reported is byte swapped. Enabling this option tells
smartctl to evaluate this quantity in byte-reversed order.
An indication that your Samsung disk needs this option is
that the self-test log is printed correctly, but there are a
very large number of errors in the SMART error log. This is
because the error count is byte swapped. Thus a disk with
five errors (0x0005) will appear to have 20480 errors
(0x5000).</p>

<p>samsung3 - Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with
Firmware VF100-37) report a self-test still in progress with
0% remaining when the test was already completed. Enabling
this option modi- fies the output of the self-test execution
status (see options &acute;-c&acute; or &acute;-a&acute;
above) accordingly.</p>

<p>Note that an explicit &acute;-F&acute; option on the
command line will over-ride any preset values for
&acute;-F&acute; (see the &acute;-P&acute; option
below).</p>

<p>swapid - Fixes byte swapped ATA identify strings (device
name, serial number, firmware version) returned by some
buggy device drivers.</p>

<p>-P TYPE, --presets=TYPE [ATA only] Specifies whether
smartctl should use any preset options that are available
for this drive. By default, if the drive is recognized in
the smartmontools database, then the pre- sets are used.</p>

<p>smartctl can automatically set appropriate options for
known drives. For example, the Maxtor 4D080H4 uses Attribute
9 to stores power-on time in minutes whereas most drives use
that Attribute to store the power-on time in hours. The
command-line option &acute;-v 9,minutes&acute; ensures that
smartctl correctly interprets Attribute 9 in this case, but
that option is preset for the Max- tor 4D080H4 and so need
not be specified by the user on the smartctl command
line.</p>

<p>The argument show will show any preset options for your
drive and the argument showall will show all known drives in
the smartmontools database, along with their preset options.
If there are no presets for your drive and you think there
should be (for example, a -v or -F option is needed to get
smartctl to display correct values) then please contact the
smartmontools developers so that this information can be
added to the smart- montools database. Contact information
is at the end of this man page.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p>use - if a drive is recognized, then use the stored
presets for it. This is the default. Note that presets will
NOT over-ride additional Attribute interpretation (&acute;-v
N,something&acute;) com- mand-line options or explicit
&acute;-F&acute; command-line options..</p>

<p>ignore - do not use presets.</p>

<p>show - show if the drive is recognized in the database,
and if so, its presets, then exit.</p>

<p>showall - list all recognized drives, and the presets
that are set for them, then exit.</p>

<p>The &acute;-P showall&acute; option takes up to two
optional arguments to match a specific drive type and
firmware version. The command: smartctl -P showall lists all
entries, the command: smartctl -P showall
&acute;MODEL&acute; lists all entries matching MODEL, and
the command: smartctl -P showall &acute;MODEL&acute;
&acute;FIRMWARE&acute; lists all entries for this MODEL and
a specific FIRMWARE ver- sion.</p>

<p>-B [+]FILE, --drivedb=[+]FILE [ATA only] [NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Read the drive database from
FILE. The new database replaces the built in database by
default. If &acute;+&acute; is specified, then the new
entries prepend the built in entries.</p>

<p>If this option is not specified, optional entries are
read from the file /etc/smart_drivedb.h (Windows:
./smart_drivedb.conf).</p>

<p>The database files use the same C/C++ syntax that is
used to initialize the built in database array. C/C++ style
comments are allowed. Example:</p>

<p>/* Full entry: */ { &quot;Model family&quot;, // Info
about model family/series. &quot;MODEL1.*REGEX&quot;, //
Regular expression to match model of device.
&quot;VERSION.*REGEX&quot;, // Regular expression to match
firmware version(s). &quot;Some warning&quot;, // Warning
message. &quot;-v 9,minutes&quot; // String of preset -v and
-F options. }, /* Minimal entry: */ { &quot;&quot;, // No
model family/series info. &quot;MODEL2.*REGEX&quot;, //
Regular expression to match model of device. &quot;&quot;,
// All firmware versions. &quot;&quot;, // No warning.
&quot;&quot; // No options preset. }, /* ... */</p>

<p>SMART RUN/ABORT OFFLINE TEST AND SELF-TEST OPTIONS:</p>

<p>-t TEST, --test=TEST Executes TEST immediately. The
&acute;-C&acute; option can be used in con- junction with
this option to run the short or long (and also for ATA
devices, selective or conveyance) self-tests in captive mode
(known as &quot;foreground mode&quot; for SCSI devices).
Note that only one test type can be run at a time, so only
one test type should be specified per command line. Note
also that if a computer is shutdown or power cycled during a
self-test, no harm should result. The self-test will either
be aborted or will resume automatically.</p>

<p>The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p>offline - runs SMART Immediate Offline Test. This
immediately starts the test described above. This command
can be given dur- ing normal system operation. The effects
of this test are visi- ble only in that it updates the SMART
Attribute values, and if errors are found they will appear
in the SMART error log, visi- ble with the &acute;-l
error&acute; option. [In the case of SCSI devices runs the
default self test in foreground. No entry is placed in the
self test log.]</p>

<p>If the &acute;-c&acute; option to smartctl shows that
the device has the &quot;Suspend Offline collection upon new
command&quot; capability then you can track the progress of
the Immediate Offline test using the &acute;-c&acute; option
to smartctl. If the &acute;-c&acute; option show that the
device has the &quot;Abort Offline collection upon new
command&quot; capa- bility then most commands will abort the
Immediate Offline Test, so you should not try to track the
progress of the test with &acute;-c&acute;, as it will abort
the test.</p>

<p>short - runs SMART Short Self Test (usually under ten
minutes). [Note: in the case of SCSI devices, this command
option runs the &quot;Background short&quot; self-test.]
This command can be given during normal system operation
(unless run in captive mode - see the &acute;-C&acute;
option below). This is a test in a different category than
the immediate or automatic offline tests. The
&quot;Self&quot; tests check the electrical and mechanical
performance as well as the read performance of the disk.
Their results are reported in the Self Test Error Log,
readable with the &acute;-l selftest&acute; option. Note
that on some disks the progress of the self-test can be
monitored by watching this log during the self-test; with
other disks use the &acute;-c&acute; option to monitor
progress.</p>

<p>long - runs SMART Extended Self Test (tens of minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices, this command option runs
the &quot;Back- ground long&quot; self-test.] This is a
longer and more thorough version of the Short Self Test
described above. Note that this command can be given during
normal system operation (unless run in captive mode - see
the &acute;-C&acute; option below).</p>

<p>conveyance - [ATA only] runs a SMART Conveyance Self
Test (min- utes). This self-test routine is intended to
identify damage incurred during transporting of the device.
This self-test rou- tine should take on the order of minutes
to complete. Note that this command can be given during
normal system operation (unless run in captive mode - see
the &acute;-C&acute; option below).</p>

<p>select,N-M, select,N+SIZE - [ATA only] runs a SMART
Selective Self Test, to test a range of disk Logical Block
Addresses (LBAs), rather than the entire disk. Each range of
LBAs that is checked is called a &quot;span&quot; and is
specified by a starting LBA (N) and an ending LBA (M) with N
less than or equal to M. The range can also be specified as
N+SIZE. A span at the end of a disk can be specified by
N-max.</p>

<p>For example the commands: smartctl -t select,10-20
/dev/hda smartctl -t select,10+11 /dev/hda both runs a self
test on one span consisting of LBAs ten to twenty
(inclusive). The command: smartctl -t select,100000000-max
/dev/hda run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of
the disk. The &acute;-t&acute; option can be given up to
five times, to test up to five spans. For example the
command: smartctl -t select,0-100 -t select,1000-2000
/dev/hda runs a self test on two spans. The first span
consists of 101 LBAs and the second span consists of 1001
LBAs. Note that the spans can overlap partially or
completely, for example: smartctl -t select,0-10 -t
select,5-15 -t select,10-20 /dev/hda The results of the
selective self-test can be obtained (both during and after
the test) by printing the SMART self-test log, using the
&acute;-l selftest&acute; option to smartctl.</p>

<p>Selective self tests are particularly useful as disk
capacities increase: an extended self test (smartctl -t
long) can take sev- eral hours. Selective self-tests are
helpful if (based on SYS- LOG error messages, previous
failed self-tests, or SMART error log entries) you suspect
that a disk is having problems at a particular range of
Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).</p>

<p>Selective self-tests can be run during normal system
operation (unless done in captive mode - see the
&acute;-C&acute; option below).</p>

<p>[Note: To use this feature on Linux, the kernel must be
compiled with the configuration option
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO enabled. Please report unusual or
incorrect behavior to the smartmon- tools-support mailing
list.]</p>

<p>The following variants of the selective self-test
command use spans based on the ranges from past tests
already stored on the disk:</p>

<p>select,redo[+SIZE] - [ATA only] redo the last SMART
Selective Self Test using the same LBA range. The starting
LBA is identi- cal to the LBA used by last test, same for
ending LBA unless a new span size is specified by optional
+SIZE argument.</p>

<p>For example the commands: smartctl -t select,10-20
/dev/hda smartctl -t select,redo /dev/hda smartctl -t
select,redo+20 /dev/hda have the same effect as: smartctl -t
select,10-20 /dev/hda smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
smartctl -t select,10-29 /dev/hda</p>

<p>select,next[+SIZE] - [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective
Self Test on the LBA range which follows the range of the
last test. The starting LBA is set to (ending LBA +1) of the
last test. A new span size may be specified by the optional
+SIZE argument.</p>

<p>For example the commands: smartctl -t select,0-999
/dev/hda smartctl -t select,next /dev/hda smartctl -t
select,next+2000 /dev/hda have the same effect as: smartctl
-t select,0-999 /dev/hda smartctl -t select,1000-1999
/dev/hda smartctl -t select,2000-3999 /dev/hda</p>

<p>If the last test ended at the last LBA of the disk, the
new range starts at LBA 0. The span size of the last span of
a disk is adjusted such that the total number of spans to
check the full disk will not be changed by future uses of
&acute;-t select,next&acute;.</p>

<p>select,cont[+SIZE] - [ATA only] performs a
&acute;redo&acute; (above) if the self test status reports
that the last test was aborted by the host. Otherwise it run
the &acute;next&acute; (above) test.</p>

<p>afterselect,on - [ATA only] perform an offline read scan
after a Selective Self-test has completed. This option must
be used together with one or more of the select,N-M options
above. If the LBAs that have been specified in the Selective
self-test pass the test with no errors found, then read scan
the remainder of the disk. If the device is powered-cycled
while this read scan is in progress, the read scan will be
automatically resumed after a time specified by the pending
timer (see below). The value of this option is preserved
between selective self-tests.</p>

<p>afterselect,off - [ATA only] do not read scan the
remainder of the disk after a Selective self-test has
completed. This option must be use together with one or more
of the select,N-M options above. The value of this option is
preserved between selective self-tests.</p>

<p>pending,N - [ATA only] set the pending offline read scan
timer to N minutes. Here N is an integer in the range from 0
to 65535 inclusive. If the device is powered off during a
read scan after a Selective self-test, then resume the test
automatically N minutes after power-up. This option must be
use together with one or more of the select,N-M options
above. The value of this option is preserved between
selective self-tests.</p>

<p>scttempint,N[,p] - [ATA only] set the time interval for
SCT tem- perature logging to N minutes. If &acute;,p&acute;
is specified, the setting is preserved across power cycles.
Otherwise, the setting is volatile and will be reverted to
default (1 minute), or last non-volatile setting by the next
hard reset. This command also clears the temperature history
table. See &acute;-l scttemp&acute; above for more
information about SCT temperature logging.</p>

<p>-C, --captive Runs self-tests in captive mode. This has
no effect with &acute;-t offline&acute; or if the
&acute;-t&acute; option is not used. [Note: in the case of
SCSI devices, this command option runs the self-test in
&quot;Foreground&quot; mode.]</p>

<p>WARNING: Tests run in captive mode may busy out the
drive for the length of the test. Only run captive tests on
drives with- out any mounted partitions!</p>

<p>-X, --abort Aborts non-captive SMART Self Tests. Note
that this command will abort the Offline Immediate Test
routine only if your disk has the &quot;Abort Offline
collection upon new command&quot; capability.</p>

<p>ATA, SCSI command sets and SAT In the past there has
been a clear distinction between storage devices that used
the ATA and SCSI command sets. This distinction was often
reflected in their device naming and hardware. Now various
SCSI trans- ports (e.g. SAS, FC and iSCSI) can interconnect
to both SCSI disks (e.g. FC and SAS) and ATA disks
(especially SATA). USB and IEEE 1394 storage devices use the
SCSI command set externally but almost always contain ATA or
SATA disks (or flash). The storage subsystems in some
operating systems have started to remove the distinction
between ATA and SCSI in their device naming policies.</p>

<p>99% of operations that an OS performs on a disk involve
the SCSI INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY, READ and WRITE commands, or
their ATA equiva- lents. Since the SCSI commands are
slightly more general than their ATA equivalents, many OSes
are generating SCSI commands (mainly READ and WRITE) and
letting a lower level translate them to their ATA equiva-
lents as the need arises. An important note here is that
&quot;lower level&quot; may be in external equipment and
hence outside the control of an OS.</p>

<p>SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) is a standard (ANSI INCITS
431-2007) that specifies how this translation is done. For
the other 1% of operations that an OS performs on a disk,
SAT provides two options. First is an optional ATA
PASS-THROUGH SCSI command (there are two variants). The
second is a translation from the closest SCSI command. Most
current interest is in the &quot;pass-through&quot;
option.</p>

<p>The relevance to smartmontools (and hence smartctl) is
that its inter- actions with disks fall solidly into the
&quot;1%&quot; category. So even if the OS can happily treat
(and name) a disk as &quot;SCSI&quot;, smartmontools needs
to detect the native command set and act accordingly. As
more storage manufacturers (including external SATA drives)
comply with SAT, smart- montools is able to automatically
distinguish the native command set of the device. In some
cases the -d sat option is needed on the command line.</p>

<p>There are also virtual disks which typically have no
useful information to convey to smartmontools, but could
conceivably in the future. An example of a virtual disk is
the OSs view of a RAID 1 box. There are most likely two SATA
disks inside a RAID 1 box. Addressing those SATA disks from
a distant OS is a challenge for smartmontools. Another
approach is running a tool like smartmontools inside the
RAID 1 box (e.g. a Network Attached Storage (NAS) box) and
fetching the logs via a browser.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES smartctl -a /dev/hda Print a large amount of
SMART information for drive /dev/hda which is typically an
ATA (IDE) or SATA disk in Linux.</p>

<p>smartctl -a /dev/sdb Print a large amount of SMART
information for drive /dev/sda . This may be a SCSI disk or
an ATA (SATA) disk.</p>

<p>smartctl -s off /dev/hdd Disable SMART monitoring and
data log collection on drive /dev/hdd .</p>

<p>smartctl --smart=on --offlineauto=on --saveauto=on
/dev/hda Enable SMART on drive /dev/hda, enable automatic
offline testing every four hours, and enable autosaving of
SMART Attributes. This is a good start-up line for your
system&acute;s init files. You can issue this command on a
running system.</p>

<p>smartctl -t long /dev/hdc Begin an extended self-test of
drive /dev/hdc. You can issue this com- mand on a running
system. The results can be seen in the self-test log visible
with the &acute;-l selftest&acute; option after it has
completed.</p>

<p>smartctl -s on -t offline /dev/hda Enable SMART on the
disk, and begin an immediate offline test of drive /dev/hda.
You can issue this command on a running system. The results
are only used to update the SMART Attributes, visible with
the &acute;-A&acute; option. If any device errors occur,
they are logged to the SMART error log, which can be seen
with the &acute;-l error&acute; option.</p>

<p>smartctl -A -v 9,minutes /dev/hda Shows the vendor
Attributes, when the disk stores its power-on time
internally in minutes rather than hours.</p>

<p>smartctl -q errorsonly -H -l selftest /dev/hda Produces
output only if the device returns failing SMART status, or
if some of the logged self-tests ended with errors.</p>

<p>smartctl -q silent -a /dev/hda Examine all SMART data
for device /dev/hda, but produce no printed out- put. You
must use the exit status (the $? shell variable) to learn if
any Attributes are out of bound, if the SMART status is
failing, if there are errors recorded in the self-test log,
or if there are errors recorded in the disk error log.</p>

<p>smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/sda Examine all SMART data
for the first ATA disk connected to a 3ware RAID controller
card.</p>

<p>smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0 Examine all SMART data
for the first ATA disk connected to a 3ware RAID
6000/7000/8000 controller card.</p>

<p>smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twa0 Examine all SMART data
for the first ATA disk connected to a 3ware RAID 9000
controller card.</p>

<p>smartctl -t short -d 3ware,3 /dev/sdb Start a short
self-test on the fourth ATA disk connected to the 3ware RAID
controller card which is the second SCSI device
/dev/sdb.</p>

<p>smartctl -t long -d areca,4 /dev/sg2 Start a long
self-test on the fourth SATA disk connected to an Areca RAID
controller addressed by /dev/sg2.</p>

<p>smartctl -a -d hpt,1/3 /dev/sda (under Linux) smartctl
-a -d hpt,1/3 /dev/hptrr (under FreeBSD) Examine all SMART
data for the (S)ATA disk directly connected to the third
channel of the first HighPoint RocketRAID controller
card.</p>

<p>smartctl -t short -d hpt,1/1/2 /dev/sda (under Linux)
smartctl -t short -d hpt,1/1/2 /dev/hptrr (under FreeBSD)
Start a short self-test on the (S)ATA disk connected to
second pmport on the first channel of the first HighPoint
RocketRAID controller card.</p>

<p>smartctl -t select,10-100 -t select,30-300 -t
afterselect,on -t pending,45 /dev/hda Run a selective
self-test on LBAs 10 to 100 and 30 to 300. After the these
LBAs have been tested, read-scan the remainder of the disk.
If the disk is power-cycled during the read-scan, resume the
scan 45 minutes after power to the device is restored.</p>

<p>smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0 Examine all SMART
data for the first SCSI disk connected to a cciss RAID
controller card.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The return values of smartctl are defined
by a bitmask. If all is well with the disk, the return value
(exit status) of smartctl is 0 (all bits turned off). If a
problem occurs, or an error, potential error, or fault is
detected, then a non-zero status is returned. In this case,
the eight different bits in the return value have the
following meanings for ATA disks; some of these values may
also be returned for SCSI disks.</p>

<p>Bit 0: Command line did not parse.</p>

<p>Bit 1: Device open failed, or device did not return an
IDENTIFY DEVICE structure.</p>

<p>Bit 2: Some SMART command to the disk failed, or there
was a checksum error in a SMART data structure (see
&acute;-b&acute; option above).</p>

<p>Bit 3: SMART status check returned &quot;DISK
FAILING&quot;.</p>

<p>Bit 4: We found prefail Attributes &lt;= threshold.</p>

<p>Bit 5: SMART status check returned &quot;DISK OK&quot;
but we found that some (usage or prefail) Attributes have
been &lt;= threshold at some time in the past.</p>

<p>Bit 6: The device error log contains records of
errors.</p>

<p>Bit 7: The device self-test log contains records of
errors.</p>

<p>To test within the shell for whether or not the
different bits are turned on or off, you can use the
following type of con- struction (this is bash syntax):
smartstat=$(($? &amp; 8)) This looks at only at bit 3 of the
exit status $? (since 8=2^3). The shell variable $smartstat
will be nonzero if SMART status check returned &quot;disk
failing&quot; and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>NOTES The TapeAlert log page flags are cleared for the
initiator when the page is read. This means that each alert
condition is reported only once by smartctl for each
initiator for each activation of the condi- tion.</p>
