<p>NAME pnmnlfilt - non-linear filters: smooth, alpha trim
mean, optimal esti- mation smoothing, edge enhancement.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmnlfilt alpha radius [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmnlfilt produces an output image where the pixels are
a summary of multiple pixels near the corresponding location
in an input image.</p>

<p>This program works on multi-image streams.</p>

<p>This is something of a swiss army knife filter. It has 3
distinct operating modes. In all of the modes pnmnlfilt
examines each pixel in the image and processes it according
to the values of it and its sur- rounding pixels. Rather
than using a square block of surrounding pix- els (e.g. the
subject pixel and its 8 immediate neighbors, in a 3x3
square), pnmnlfilt uses 7 hexagonal areas. You choose the
size of the hexagons with the radius parameter. A radius
value of 1/3 means that the 7 hexagons essentially fit into
the subject pixel (ie. there will be no filtering effect). A
radius value of 1.0 means that the 7 hexagons essentially
cover the 3x3 immediate neighbor square.</p>

<p>Your choice of alpha parameter selects among the three
modes.</p>

<p>Alpha trimmed mean filter (0.0 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 0.5)
The value of the center pixel will be replaced by the mean
of the 7 hexagon values, but the 7 values are sorted by size
and the top and bottom alpha portion of the 7 are excluded
from the mean. This implies that an alpha value of 0.0 gives
the same sort of output as a normal convolution (ie.
averaging or smoothing filter), where radius will determine
the strength of the filter. A good value to start from for
subtle filtering is alpha = 0.0, radius = 0.55 For a more
blatant effect, try alpha 0.0 and radius 1.0</p>

<p>An alpha value of 0.5 will cause the median value of the
7 hexagons to be used to replace the center pixel value.
This sort of filter is good for eliminating pop or single
pixel noise from an image without spreading the noise out or
smudging features on the image. Judicious use of the radius
parameter will fine tune the filtering. Intermediate values
of alpha give effects somewhere between smoothing and pop
noise reduction. For subtle filtering try starting with
values of alpha = 0.4, radius = 0.6 For a more blatant
effect try alpha = 0.5, radius = 1.0</p>

<p>Optimal estimation smoothing. (1.0 &lt;= alpha &lt;=
2.0) This type of filter applies a smoothing filter
adaptively over the image. For each pixel the variance of
the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, and the amount
of smoothing is made inversely propor- tional to it. The
idea is that if the variance is small then it is due to
noise in the image, while if the variance is large, it is
because of wanted image features. As usual the radius
parameter controls the effective radius, but it probably
advisable to leave the radius between 0.8 and 1.0 for the
variance calculation to be meaningful. The alpha parameter
sets the noise threshold, over which less smoothing will be
done. This means that small values of alpha will give the
most subtle filtering effect, while large values will tend
to smooth all parts of the image. You could start with
values like alpha = 1.2, radius = 1.0 and try increasing or
decreasing the alpha parameter to get the desired effect.
This type of filter is best for filtering out dithering
noise in both bitmap and color images.</p>

<p>Edge enhancement. (-0.1 &gt;= alpha &gt;= -0.9) This is
the opposite type of filter to the smoothing filter. It
enhances edges. The alpha parameter controls the amount of
edge enhancement, from subtle (-0.1) to blatant (-0.9). The
radius parameter controls the effective radius as usual, but
useful values are between 0.5 and 0.9. Try starting with
values of alpha = 0.3, radius = 0.8</p>

<p>Combination use. The various modes of pnmnlfilt can be
used one after the other to get the desired result. For
instance to turn a monochrome dithered image into a
grayscale image you could try one or two passes of the
smoothing filter, followed by a pass of the optimal
estimation filter, then some subtle edge enhancement. Note
that using edge enhancement is only likely to be useful
after one of the non-linear filters (alpha trimmed mean or
optimal estimation filter), as edge enhancement is the
direct opposite of smoothing.</p>

<p>For reducing color quantization noise in images (ie.
turning .gif files back into 24 bit files) you could try a
pass of the optimal estimation filter (alpha 1.2, radius
1.0), a pass of the median filter (alpha 0.5, radius 0.55),
and possibly a pass of the edge enhancement filter. Sev-
eral passes of the optimal estimation filter with declining
alpha val- ues are more effective than a single pass with a
large alpha value. As usual, there is a tradeoff between
filtering effectiveness and loosing detail. Experimentation
is encouraged.</p>

the description in IEEE CG&amp;A May 1990 Page 23 by Mark E.
Lee and Richard A. Redner, and has been enhanced to allow
continuous alpha adjustment.</p>
