<p>NAME interdiff - show differences between two diff
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS interdiff [[-p n] | [--strip-match=n]] [[-U n]
| [--unified=n]] [[-d PAT] | [--drop-context=PAT]] [[-q] |
[--quiet]] [[-z] | [--decompress]] [[-b] |
[--ignore-space-change]] [[-B] | [--ignore-blank-lines]]
[[-i] | [--ignore-case]] [[-w] | [--ignore-all-space]]
[[--interpolate] | [--combine] | [--flip]]
[--no-revert-omitted] diff1 diff2</p>

<p>interdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION interdiff creates a unified format diff that
expresses the difference between two diffs. The diffs must
both be relative to the same files. For best results, the
diffs must have at least three lines of context.</p>

<p>To reverse a patch, use /dev/null for diff2.</p>

<p>To reduce the amount of context in a patch, use:</p>

<p>interdiff -U1 /dev/null patchfile</p>

<p>Since interdiff doesn&acute;t have the advantage of
being able to look at the files that are to be modified, it
has stricter requirements on the input format than patch(1)
does. The output of GNU diff will be okay, even with
extensions, but if you intend to use a hand-edited patch it
might be wise to clean up the offsets and counts using
recountdiff(1) first.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the two patches must both be
relative to the versions of the same original set of
files.</p>

<p>The diffs may be in context format. The output, however,
will be in unified format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Ignored, for compatibility with older
versions of interdiff. This option will go away soon.</p>

<p>-p n, --strip-match=n When comparing filenames, ignore
the first n pathname components from both patches. (This is
similar to the -p option to GNU patch(1).)</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quieter output. Don&acute;t emit rationale
lines at the beginning of each patch.</p>

<p>-U n, --unified=n Attempt to display n lines of context
(requires at least n lines of context in both input files).
(This is similar to the -U option to GNU diff(1).)</p>

<p>-d PATTERN, --drop-context=PATTERN Don&acute;t display
any context on files that match the shell wildcard PATTERN.
This option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>Note that the interpretation of the shell wildcard
pattern does not count slash characters or periods as
special (in other words, no flags are given to fnmatch).
This is so that */basename-type patterns can be given
without limiting the number of pathname components.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Consider upper- and lower-case to be
the same.</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space Ignore whitespace changes in
patches.</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change Ignore changes in the amount
of whitespace.</p>

<p>-B, --ignore-blank-lines Ignore changes whose lines are
all blank.</p>

<p>-z, --decompress Decompress files with extensions .gz
and .bz2.</p>

<p>--interpolate Run as interdiff. This is the default.</p>

<p>--combine Run as combinediff . See combinediff(1) for
more information about how the behaviour is altered in this
mode.</p>

<p>--no-revert-omitted (For interpolation mode only) When a
file is changed by the first patch but not by the second,
don&acute;t revert that change.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of interdiff.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Basic usage:</p>

<p>interdiff -z 3.2pre1.patch.gz 3.2pre2.patch.gz</p>

<p>Reversing a patch:</p>

<p>interdiff patch /dev/null</p>

<p>Reversing part of a patch (and ignoring the rest):</p>

<p>filterdiff -i file.c patchfile | interdiff /dev/stdin
/dev/null</p>

<p>BUGS There are currently no known bugs in interdiff; but
there are some caveats. If you find a bug, please report it
(along with a minimal test case) to Tim Waugh
twaugh@redhat.com.</p>

<p>There are some sets of patches in which there is just
not enough information to produce a proper interdiff. In
this case, the strategy employed is to revert the original
patch and apply the new patch. This, unfortunately, means
that interdiffs are not guaranteed to be reversible.</p>
