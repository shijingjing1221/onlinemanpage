<p>NAME fd - floppy disk device</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Floppy drives are block devices with major
number 2. Typically they are owned by root.floppy (i.e.,
user root, group floppy) and have either mode 0660 (access
checking via group membership) or mode 0666 (everybody has
access). The minor numbers encode the device type, drive
number, and controller number. For each device type (that
is, combination of density and track count) there is a base
minor number. To this base number, add the drive s number on
its controller and 128 if the drive is on the secondary
controller. In the following device tables, n represents the
drive number.</p>

<p>Warning: If you use formats with more tracks than
supported by your drive, you may cause it mechanical damage.
Trying once if more tracks than the usual 40/80 are
supported should not damage it, but no war- ranty is given
for that. Dont create device entries for those formats to
prevent their usage if you are not sure.</p>

<p>Drive independent device files which automatically
detect the media format and capacity:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fd special files access the floppy disk
drives in raw mode. The fol- lowing ioctl(2) calls are
supported by fd devices:</p>

<p>FDCLRPRM clears the media information of a drive
(geometry of disk in drive).</p>

<p>FDSETPRM sets the media information of a drive. The
media information will be lost when the media is
changed.</p>

<p>FDDEFPRM sets the media information of a drive (geometry
of disk in drive). The media information will not be lost
when the media is changed. This will disable autodetection.
In order to re- enable autodetection, you have to issue an
FDCLRPRM.</p>

<p>FDGETDRVTYP returns the type of a drive (name
parameter). For formats which work in several drive types,
FDGETDRVTYP returns a name which is appropriate for the
oldest drive type which supports this for- mat.</p>

<p>FDFLUSH invalidates the buffer cache for the given
drive.</p>

<p>FDSETMAXERRS sets the error thresholds for reporting
errors, aborting the operation, recalibrating, resetting,
and reading sector by sec- tor.</p>

<p>FDSETMAXERRS gets the current error thresholds.</p>

<p>FDGETDRVTYP gets the internal name of the drive.</p>

<p>FDWERRORCLR clears the write error statistics.</p>

<p>FDWERRORGET reads the write error statistics. These
include the total num- ber of write errors, the location and
disk of the first write error, and the location and disk of
the last write error. Disks are identified by a generation
number which is incremented at (almost) each disk
change.</p>

<p>FDTWADDLE Switch the drive motor off for a few
microseconds. This might be needed in order to access a disk
whose sectors are too close together.</p>

<p>FDSETDRVPRM sets various drive parameters.</p>

<p>FDGETDRVPRM reads these parameters back.</p>

<p>FDGETDRVSTAT gets the cached drive state (disk changed,
write protected et al.)</p>

<p>FDPOLLDRVSTAT polls the drive and return its state.</p>

<p>FDGETFDCSTAT gets the floppy controller state.</p>

<p>FDRESET resets the floppy controller under certain
conditions.</p>

<p>FDRAWCMD sends a raw command to the floppy
controller.</p>

<p>For more precise information, consult also the
&lt;linux/fd.h&gt; and &lt;linux/fdreg.h&gt; include files,
as well as the manual page for floppy- control.</p>

<p>NOTES The various formats allow to read and write many
types of disks. How- ever, if a floppy is formatted with a
too small inter sector gap, per- formance may drop, up to
needing a few seconds to access an entire track. To prevent
this, use interleaved formats. It is not possible to read
floppies which are formatted using GCR (group code
recording), which is used by Apple II and Macintosh
computers (800k disks). Read- ing floppies which are hard
sectored (one hole per sector, with the index hole being a
little skewed) is not supported. This used to be common with
older 8 inch floppies.</p>
