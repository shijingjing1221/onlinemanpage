<p>NAME iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswalpha(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswalpha() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the isal- pha(3) function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the
wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot; is a subclass
of the wide-character class &quot;alnum&quot;, and therefore
also a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;graph&quot; and of the wide-character class
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;graph&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;space&quot; and its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide-character class
&quot;alnum&quot;, the wide-charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide-character class
&quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint
from the wide-character class &quot;digit&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot; contains the
wide-character classes &quot;upper&quot; and
&quot;lower&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide-character class &quot;alpha&quot; always
contains at least the letters &rsquo;A&rsquo; to
&rsquo;Z&rsquo; and &rsquo;a&rsquo; to &rsquo;z&rsquo;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswalpha() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class
&quot;alpha&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of iswalpha() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>
