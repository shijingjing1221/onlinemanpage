<p>SYMLINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SYMLINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME symlinkat - create a symbolic link relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int symlinkat(const char *oldpath, int newdirfd, const
char *newpath);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The symlinkat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as sym- link(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in newpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor newdirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by symlink(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If newpath is relative and newdirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then newpath is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
symlink(2)).</p>

<p>If newpath is absolute, then newdirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, symlinkat() returns 0. On
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for symlink(2) can
also occur for sym- linkat(). The following additional
errors can occur for symlinkat():</p>

<p>EBADF newdirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR newpath is relative and newdirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS symlinkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
symlinkat().</p>
