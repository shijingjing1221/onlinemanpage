<p>NAME XPropertyEvent - PropertyNotify event structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for PropertyNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* PropertyNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window window; Atom atom; Time time; int state; /*
PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete */ } XPropertyEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The window member is set to the window whose associated
property was changed. The atom member is set to the
propertys atom and indicates which property was changed or
desired. The time member is set to the server time when the
property was changed. The state member is set to indicate
whether the property was changed to a new value or deleted
and can be PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete. The state
member is set to PropertyNewValue when a property of the
window is changed using XChangeProperty or
XRotateWindowProperties (even when adding zero- length data
using XChangeProperty) and when replacing all or part of a
property with identical data using XChangeProperty or
XRotateWindow- Properties. The state member is set to
PropertyDelete when a property of the window is deleted
using XDeleteProperty or, if the delete argu- ment is True,
XGetWindowProperty.</p>
