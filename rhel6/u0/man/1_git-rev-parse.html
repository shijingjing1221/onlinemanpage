<p>GIT-REV-PARSE(1) Git Manual GIT-REV-PARSE(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-rev-parse - Pick out and massage parameters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git rev-parse [ --option ] &lt;args&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Many git porcelainish commands take mixture
of flags (i.e. parameters that begin with a dash -) and
parameters meant for the underlying git rev-list command
they use internally and flags and parameters for the other
commands they use downstream of git rev-list. This command
is used to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --parseopt Use git rev-parse in option parsing
mode (see PARSEOPT section below).</p>

<p>--keep-dashdash Only meaningful in --parseopt mode.
Tells the option parser to echo out the first -- met instead
of skipping it.</p>

<p>--stop-at-non-option Only meaningful in --parseopt mode.
Lets the option parser stop at the first non-option
argument. This can be used to parse sub-commands that take
options themselves.</p>

<p>--sq-quote Use git rev-parse in shell quoting mode (see
SQ-QUOTE section below). In contrast to the --sq option
below, this mode does only quoting. Nothing else is done to
command input.</p>

<p>--revs-only Do not output flags and parameters not meant
for git rev-list command.</p>

<p>--no-revs Do not output flags and parameters meant for
git rev-list command.</p>

<p>--flags Do not output non-flag parameters.</p>

<p>--no-flags Do not output flag parameters.</p>

<p>--default &lt;arg&gt; If there is no parameter given by
the user, use &lt;arg&gt; instead.</p>

<p>--verify The parameter given must be usable as a single,
valid object name. Otherwise barf and abort.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Only meaningful in --verify mode. Do not
output an error message if the first argument is not a valid
object name; instead exit with non-zero status silently.</p>

<p>--sq Usually the output is made one line per flag and
parameter. This option makes output a single line, properly
quoted for consumption by shell. Useful when you expect your
parameter to contain whitespaces and newlines (e.g. when
using pickaxe -S with git diff-*). In contrast to the
--sq-quote option, the command input is still interpreted as
usual.</p>

<p>--not When showing object names, prefix them with ^ and
strip ^ prefix from the object names that already have
one.</p>

<p>--symbolic Usually the object names are output in SHA1
form (with possible ^ prefix); this option makes them output
in a form as close to the original input as possible.</p>

<p>--symbolic-full-name This is similar to --symbolic, but
it omits input that are not refs (i.e. branch or tag names;
or more explicitly disambiguating &quot;heads/master&quot;
form, when you want to name the &quot;master&quot; branch
when there is an unfortunately named tag
&quot;master&quot;), and show them as full refnames (e.g.
&quot;refs/heads/master&quot;).</p>

<p>--abbrev-ref[={strict|loose}] A non-ambiguous short name
of the objects name. The option core.warnAmbiguousRefs is
used to select the strict abbreviation mode.</p>

<p>--all Show all refs found in refs/.</p>

<p>--branches[=pattern], --tags[=pattern],
--remotes[=pattern] Show all branches, tags, or
remote-tracking branches, respectively (i.e., refs found in
refs/heads, refs/tags, or refs/remotes, respectively).</p>

<p>If a pattern is given, only refs matching the given
shell glob are shown. If the pattern does not contain a
globbing character (?, *, or [), it is turned into a prefix
match by appending /</p>

<p>--glob=pattern Show all refs matching the shell glob
pattern pattern. If the pattern does not start with refs/,
this is automatically prepended. If the pattern does not
contain a globbing character (?, *, or [), it is turned into
a prefix match by appending /</p>

<p>--show-toplevel Show the absolute path of the top-level
directory.</p>

<p>--show-prefix When the command is invoked from a
subdirectory, show the path of the current directory
relative to the top-level directory.</p>

<p>--show-cdup When the command is invoked from a
subdirectory, show the path of the top-level directory
relative to the current directory (typically a sequence of
&quot;../&quot;, or an empty string).</p>

<p>--git-dir Show $GIT_DIR if defined else show the path to
the .git directory.</p>

<p>--is-inside-git-dir When the current working directory
is below the repository directory print &quot;true&quot;,
otherwise &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>--is-inside-work-tree When the current working directory
is inside the work tree of the repository print
&quot;true&quot;, otherwise &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>--is-bare-repository When the repository is bare print
&quot;true&quot;, otherwise &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>--local-env-vars List the GIT_* environment variables
that are local to the repository (e.g. GIT_DIR or
GIT_WORK_TREE, but not GIT_EDITOR). Only the names of the
variables are listed, not their value, even if they are
set.</p>

<p>--short, --short=number Instead of outputting the full
SHA1 values of object names try to abbreviate them to a
shorter unique name. When no length is specified 7 is used.
The minimum length is 4.</p>

<p>--since=datestring, --after=datestring Parse the date
string, and output the corresponding --max-age= parameter
for git rev-list.</p>

<p>--until=datestring, --before=datestring Parse the date
string, and output the corresponding --min-age= parameter
for git rev-list.</p>

<p>&lt;args&gt;... Flags and parameters to be parsed.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING REVISIONS A revision parameter typically, but
not necessarily, names a commit object. They use what is
called an extended SHA1 syntax. Here are various ways to
spell object names. The ones listed near the end of this
list are to name trees and blobs contained in a commit.</p>

<p>&middot; The full SHA1 object name (40-byte hexadecimal
string), or a substring of such that is unique within the
repository. E.g. dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735
and dae86e both name the same commit object if there are no
other object in your repository whose object name starts
with dae86e.</p>

<p>&middot; An output from git describe; i.e. a closest
tag, optionally followed by a dash and a number of commits,
followed by a dash, a g, and an abbreviated object name.</p>

<p>&middot; A symbolic ref name. E.g. master typically
means the commit object referenced by refs/heads/master. If
you happen to have both heads/master and tags/master, you
can explicitly say heads/master to tell git which one you
mean. When ambiguous, a &lt;name&gt; is disambiguated by
taking the first match in the following rules:</p>

<p>1. if $GIT_DIR/&lt;name&gt; exists, that is what you
mean (this is usually useful only for HEAD, FETCH_HEAD,
ORIG_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD);</p>

<p>2. otherwise, refs/&lt;name&gt; if exists;</p>

<p>3. otherwise, refs/tags/&lt;name&gt; if exists;</p>

<p>4. otherwise, refs/heads/&lt;name&gt; if exists;</p>

<p>5. otherwise, refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt; if exists;</p>

<p>6. otherwise, refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD if
exists.</p>

<p>HEAD names the commit your changes in the working tree
is based on. FETCH_HEAD records the branch you fetched from
a remote repository with your last git fetch invocation.
ORIG_HEAD is created by commands that moves your HEAD in a
drastic way, to record the position of the HEAD before their
operation, so that you can change the tip of the branch back
to the state before you ran them easily. MERGE_HEAD records
the commit(s) you are merging into your branch when you run
git merge.</p>

<p>Note that any of the refs/* cases above may come either
from the $GIT_DIR/refs directory or from the
$GIT_DIR/packed-refs file.</p>

<p>&middot; A ref followed by the suffix @ with a date
specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. {yesterday}, {1
month 2 weeks 3 days 1 hour 1 second ago} or {1979-02-26
18:30:00}) to specify the value of the ref at a prior point
in time. This suffix may only be used immediately following
a ref name and the ref must have an existing log
($GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;). Note that this looks up the
state of your local ref at a given time; e.g., what was in
your local master branch last week. If you want to look at
commits made during certain times, see --since and
--until.</p>

<p>&middot; A ref followed by the suffix @ with an ordinal
specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. {1}, {15}) to
specify the n-th prior value of that ref. For example
master@{1} is the immediate prior value of master while
master@{5} is the 5th prior value of master. This suffix may
only be used immediately following a ref name and the ref
must have an existing log ($GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;).</p>

<p>&middot; You can use the @ construct with an empty ref
part to get at a reflog of the current branch. For example,
if you are on the branch blabla, then @{1} means the same as
blabla@{1}.</p>

<p>&middot; The special construct @{-&lt;n&gt;} means the
&lt;n&gt;th branch checked out before the current one.</p>

<p>&middot; The suffix @{upstream} to a ref (short form
ref@{u}) refers to the branch the ref is set to build on top
of. Missing ref defaults to the current branch.</p>

<p>&middot; A suffix ^ to a revision parameter means the
first parent of that commit object. ^&lt;n&gt; means the
&lt;n&gt;th parent (i.e. rev^ is equivalent to rev^1). As a
special rule, rev^0 means the commit itself and is used when
rev is the object name of a tag object that refers to a
commit object.</p>

<p>&middot; A suffix ~&lt;n&gt; to a revision parameter
means the commit object that is the &lt;n&gt;th generation
grand-parent of the named commit object, following only the
first parent. I.e. rev~3 is equivalent to rev^^^ which is
equivalent to rev^1^1^1. See below for a illustration of the
usage of this form.</p>

<p>&middot; A suffix ^ followed by an object type name
enclosed in brace pair (e.g. v0.99.8^{commit}) means the
object could be a tag, and dereference the tag recursively
until an object of that type is found or the object cannot
be dereferenced anymore (in which case, barf). rev^0
introduced earlier is a short-hand for rev^{commit}.</p>

<p>&middot; A suffix ^ followed by an empty brace pair
(e.g. v0.99.8^{}) means the object could be a tag, and
dereference the tag recursively until a non-tag object is
found.</p>

<p>&middot; A colon, followed by a slash, followed by a
text: this names a commit whose commit message starts with
the specified text. This name returns the youngest matching
commit which is reachable from any ref. If the commit
message starts with a !, you have to repeat that; the
special sequence :/!, followed by something else than ! is
reserved for now.</p>

<p>&middot; A suffix : followed by a path; this names the
blob or tree at the given path in the tree-ish object named
by the part before the colon.</p>

<p>&middot; A colon, optionally followed by a stage number
(0 to 3) and a colon, followed by a path; this names a blob
object in the index at the given path. Missing stage number
(and the colon that follows it) names a stage 0 entry.
During a merge, stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is
the target branch s version (typically the current branch),
and stage 3 is the version from the branch being merged.</p>

<p>Here is an illustration, by Jon Loeliger. Both commit
nodes B and C are parents of commit node A. Parent commits
are ordered left-to-right.</p>

<p>G H I J / / D E F | / | / | / | B C / / A</p>

<p>A = = A^0 B = A^ = A^1 = A~1 C = A^2 = A^2 D = A^^ =
A^1^1 = A~2 E = B^2 = A^^2 F = B^3 = A^^3 G = A^^^ = A^1^1^1
= A~3 H = D^2 = B^^2 = A^^^2 = A~2^2 I = F^ = B^3^ = A^^3^ J
= F^2 = B^3^2 = A^^3^2</p>

<p>SPECIFYING RANGES History traversing commands such as
git log operate on a set of commits, not just a single
commit. To these commands, specifying a single revision with
the notation described in the previous section means the set
of commits reachable from that commit, following the commit
ancestry chain.</p>

<p>To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix ^
notation is used. E.g. ^r1 r2 means commits reachable from
r2 but exclude the ones reachable from r1.</p>

<p>This set operation appears so often that there is a
shorthand for it. When you have two commits r1 and r2 (named
according to the syntax explained in SPECIFYING REVISIONS
above), you can ask for commits that are reachable from r2
excluding those that are reachable from r1 by ^r1 r2 and it
can be written as r1..r2.</p>

<p>A similar notation r1...r2 is called symmetric
difference of r1 and r2 and is defined as r1 r2 --not $(git
merge-base --all r1 r2). It is the set of commits that are
reachable from either one of r1 or r2 but not from both.</p>

<p>Two other shorthands for naming a set that is formed by
a commit and its parent commits exist. The r1^@ notation
means all parents of r1. r1^! includes commit r1 but
excludes all of its parents.</p>

<p>Here are a handful of examples:</p>

<p>D G H D D F G H I J D F ^G D H D ^D B E I J F B B...C G
H D E B C ^D B C E I J F B C C^@ I J F F^! D G H D F</p>

<p>PARSEOPT In --parseopt mode, git rev-parse helps
massaging options to bring to shell scripts the same
facilities C builtins have. It works as an option normalizer
(e.g. splits single switches aggregate values), a bit like
getopt(1) does.</p>

<p>It takes on the standard input the specification of the
options to parse and understand, and echoes on the standard
output a line suitable for sh(1) eval to replace the
arguments with normalized ones. In case of error, it outputs
usage on the standard error stream, and exits with code
129.</p>

<p>Input Format git rev-parse --parseopt input format is
fully text based. It has two parts, separated by a line that
contains only --. The lines before the separator (should be
more than one) are used for the usage. The lines after the
separator describe the options.</p>

<p>Each line of options has this format:</p>

<p>&lt;opt_spec&gt;&lt;flags&gt;* SP+ help LF</p>

<p>&lt;opt_spec&gt; its format is the short option
character, then the long option name separated by a comma.
Both parts are not required, though at least one is
necessary. h,help, dry-run and f are all three correct
&lt;opt_spec&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;flags&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;flags&gt; are of *, =, ? or !.</p>

<p>&middot; Use = if the option takes an argument.</p>

<p>&middot; Use ? to mean that the option is optional
(though its use is discouraged).</p>

<p>&middot; Use * to mean that this option should not be
listed in the usage generated for the -h argument. Its shown
for --help-all as documented in gitcli(7).</p>

<p>&middot; Use ! to not make the corresponding negated
long option available.</p>

<p>The remainder of the line, after stripping the spaces,
is used as the help associated to the option.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored, and lines that don t match this
specification are used as option group headers (start the
line with a space to create such lines on purpose).</p>

<p>Example OPTS_SPEC=&quot; some-command [options]
&lt;args&gt;...</p>

<p>some-command does foo and bar! -- h,help show the
help</p>

<p>foo some nifty option --foo bar= some cool option --bar
with an argument</p>

<p>An option group Header C? option C with an optional
argument&quot;</p>

<p>eval echo &quot;$OPTS_SPEC&quot; | git rev-parse
--parseopt -- &quot;$@&quot; || echo exit $?</p>

<p>SQ-QUOTE In --sq-quote mode, git rev-parse echoes on the
standard output a single line suitable for sh(1) eval. This
line is made by normalizing the arguments following
--sq-quote. Nothing other than quoting the arguments is
done.</p>

<p>If you want command input to still be interpreted as
usual by git rev-parse before the output is shell quoted,
see the --sq option.</p>

<p>Example $ cat &gt;your-git-script.sh &lt;&lt; #!/bin/sh
args=$(git rev-parse --sq-quote &quot;$@&quot;) # quote
user-supplied arguments command=&quot;git frotz -n24
$args&quot; # and use it inside a handcrafted # command line
eval &quot;$command&quot; EOF</p>

<p>$ sh your-git-script.sh &quot;a b&acute;c&quot;</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &middot; Print the object name of the current
commit:</p>

<p>$ git rev-parse --verify HEAD</p>

<p>&middot; Print the commit object name from the revision
in the $REV shell variable:</p>

<p>$ git rev-parse --verify $REV</p>

<p>This will error out if $REV is empty or not a valid
revision.</p>

<p>&middot; Same as above:</p>

<p>$ git rev-parse --default master --verify $REV</p>

<p>but if $REV is empty, the commit object name from master
will be printed.</p>
