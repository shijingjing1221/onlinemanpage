<p>NAME ccmake - Curses Interface for CMake.</p>

<p>USAGE ccmake &lt;path-to-source&gt; ccmake
&lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;ccmake&quot; executable is the
CMake curses interface. Project config- uration settings may
be specified interactively through this GUI. Brief
instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal when
the program is running.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C &lt;initial-cache&gt; Pre-load a script to
populate the cache.</p>

<p>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it
creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a file from which to load cache entries
before the first pass through the project s cmake listfiles.
The loaded entries take priority over the projects default
values. The given file should be a CMake script containing
SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format
file.</p>

<p>-D &lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt; Create a cmake
cache entry.</p>

<p>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it
creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a setting that takes priority over the
projects default value. The option may be repeated for as
many cache entries as desired.</p>

<p>-U &lt;globbing_expr&gt; Remove matching entries from
CMake cache.</p>

<p>This option may be used to remove one or more variables
from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using *
and ? are sup- ported. The option may be repeated for as
many cache entries as desired.</p>

<p>Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt
non-working.</p>

<p>-G &lt;generator-name&gt; Specify a makefile
generator.</p>

<p>CMake may support multiple native build systems on
certain plat- forms. A makefile generator is responsible for
generating a particular build system. Possible generator
names are specified in the Generators section.</p>

<p>-Wno-dev Suppress developer warnings.</p>

<p>Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMake- Lists.txt files.</p>

<p>-Wdev Enable developer warnings.</p>

<p>Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMake- Lists.txt files.</p>

<p>GENERATORS Unix Makefiles Generates standard UNIX
makefiles.</p>

<p>A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the
build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can build
the project through the default make target. A &quot;make
install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles Generates CodeBlocks project
files.</p>

<p>Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call.
Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated into the
build tree. The appropriate make program can build the
project through the default make tar- get. A &quot;make
install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles Generates Eclipse CDT 4.0
project files.</p>

<p>Project files for Eclipse will be created in the top
directory and will have a linked resource to every
subdirectory which fea- tures a CMakeLists.txt file
containing a PROJECT() call.Addi- tionally a hierarchy of
makefiles is generated into the build tree. The appropriate
make program can build the project through the default make
target. A &quot;make install&quot; target is also pro-
vided.</p>

<p>KDevelop3 Generates KDevelop 3 project files.</p>

<p>Project files for KDevelop 3 will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. If you
change the settings using KDevelop cmake will try its best
to keep your changes when regenerating the project files.
Additionally a hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into
the build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can
build the project through the default make target. A
&quot;make install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>KDevelop3 - Unix Makefiles Generates KDevelop 3 project
files.</p>

<p>Project files for KDevelop 3 will be created in the top
direc- tory and in every subdirectory which features a
CMakeLists.txt file containing a PROJECT() call. If you
change the settings using KDevelop cmake will try its best
to keep your changes when regenerating the project files.
Additionally a hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into
the build tree. Any standard UNIX-style make program can
build the project through the default make target. A
&quot;make install&quot; target is also provided.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>COMMAND add_custom_command Add a custom build rule to
the generated build system.</p>

<p>There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The
first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an
output.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...] COMMAND
command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND command2 [ARGS]
[args2...] ...] [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend] [DEPENDS
[depends...]] [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1 ...]
[WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM]
[APPEND])</p>

<p>This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT
file(s). A target created in the same directory
(CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the
custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate
the file using the command at build time. If an output name
is a relative path it will be inter- preted relative to the
build tree directory corresponding to the current source
directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is com- pletely
optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about
where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this
creates a new target in the following form:</p>

<p>OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS COMMAND</p>

<p>If more than one command is specified they will be
executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for
backward compatibility and will be ignored.</p>

<p>The second signature adds a custom command to a target
such as a library or executable. This is useful for
performing an opera- tion before or after building the
target. The command becomes part of the target and will only
execute when the target itself is built. If the target is
already built, the command will not execute.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(TARGET target PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK |
POST_BUILD COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND
command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
[COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])</p>

<p>This defines a new command that will be associated with
building the specified target. When the command will happen
is determined by which of the following is specified:</p>

<p>PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies PRE_LINK -
run after other dependencies POST_BUILD - run after the
target has been built</p>

<p>Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on
Visual Stu- dio 7 or later. For all other generators
PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.</p>

<p>If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be
executed in the directory given. If COMMENT is set, the
value will be displayed as a message before the commands are
executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND
and DEPENDS option val- ues are appended to the custom
command for the first output specified. There must have
already been a previous call to this command with the same
output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY
options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may
be used in the future.</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>If the output of the custom command is not actually
created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC
with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.</p>

<p>The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of
implicit depen- dencies of an input file. The language given
specifies the pro- gramming language whose corresponding
dependency scanner should be used. Currently only C and CXX
language scanners are sup- ported. Dependencies discovered
from the scanning are added to those of the custom command
at build time. Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is
currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be
ignored by other generators.</p>

<p>If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by
ADD_EXE- CUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the
location of the executable created at build time.
Additionally a tar- get-level dependency will be added so
that the executable target will be built before any target
using this custom command. How- ever this does NOT add a
file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to
re-run whenever the executable is recom- piled.</p>

<p>The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command
depends. If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom
command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake
automatically brings the other custom command into the
target in which this command is built. If DEPENDS specifies
any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level
dependency is created to make sure the target is built
before any target using this custom command. Additionally,
if the target is an executable or library a file-level
dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run
whenever the target is recompiled.</p>

<p>add_custom_target Add a target with no output so it will
always be built.</p>

<p>add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
[COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...] [DEPENDS depend depend
depend ... ] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] [COMMENT comment]
[VERBATIM] [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])</p>

<p>Adds a target with the given name that executes the
given com- mands. The target has no output file and is
ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to
create a file with the name of the target. Use
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By
default nothing depends on the custom tar- get. Use
ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other
targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that
this target should be added to the default build target so
that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called
ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not
specified an empty target will be created. If
WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in
that directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be
displayed as a message before the commands are executed at
build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument
may reference files and outputs of custom commands cre- ated
with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMake-
Lists.txt file).</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>The SOURCES option specifies additional source files to
be included in the custom target. Specified source files
will be added to IDE project files for convenience in
editing even if they have not build rules.</p>

<p>add_definitions Adds -D define flags to the compilation
of source files.</p>

<p>add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in
the cur- rent directory and below. This command can be used
to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add
preprocessor defi- nitions. Flags beginning in -D or /D that
look like preproces- sor definitions are automatically added
to the COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS property for the current
directory. Definitions with non-trival values may be left in
the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of
backwards compatibility. See documentation of the directory,
target, and source file COM- PILE_DEFINITIONS properties for
details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific
scopes and configurations.</p>

<p>add_dependencies Add a dependency between top-level
targets.</p>

<p>add_dependencies(target-name depend-target1
depend-target2 ...)</p>

<p>Make a top-level target depend on other top-level
targets. A top-level target is one created by
ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET. Adding
dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one
target is built before another target. See the DEPENDS
option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COM- MAND for
adding file-level dependencies in custom rules. See the
OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add
file-level dependencies to object files.</p>

<p>add_executable Add an executable to the project using
the specified source files.</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds an executable target called &lt;name&gt; to be
built from the source files listed in the command
invocation. The &lt;name&gt; cor- responds to the logical
target name and must be globally unique within a project.
The actual file name of the executable built is constructed
based on conventions of the native platform (such as
&lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).</p>

<p>By default the executable file will be created in the
build tree directory corresponding to the source tree
directory in which the command was invoked. See
documentation of the RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY target
property to change this location. See doc- umentation of the
OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part
of the final file name.</p>

<p>If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be
set on the target created. See documentation of that target
property for details.</p>

<p>If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED
executable targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED)</p>

<p>An IMPORTED executable target references an executable
file located outside the project. No rules are generated to
build it. The target name has scope in the directory in
which it is created and below. It may be referenced like any
target built within the project. IMPORTED executables are
useful for conve- nient reference from commands like
add_custom_command. Details about the imported executable
are specified by setting proper- ties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main executable file on disk. See
documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more
information.</p>

<p>add_library Add a library to the project using the
specified source files.</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds a library target called &lt;name&gt; to be built
from the source files listed in the command invocation. The
&lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must
be globally unique within a project. The actual file name of
the library built is con- structed based on conventions of
the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a or
&lt;name&gt;.lib).</p>

<p>STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the
type of library to be created. STATIC libraries are archives
of object files for use when linking other targets. SHARED
libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.
MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other
targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using
dlopen-like functionality. If no type is given explicitly
the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current
value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.</p>

<p>By default the library file will be created in the build
tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in
which the command was invoked. See documentation of the
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and
RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this
location. See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target
property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file
name.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library
targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt;
&lt;SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN&gt; IMPORTED)</p>

<p>An IMPORTED library target references a library file
located outside the project. No rules are generated to build
it. The target name has scope in the directory in which it
is created and below. It may be referenced like any target
built within the project. IMPORTED libraries are useful for
convenient ref- erence from commands like
target_link_libraries. Details about the imported library
are specified by setting properties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main library file on disk. See documentation
of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory Add a subdirectory to the build.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])</p>

<p>Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir
specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt
and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will
be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the
typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The
binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the
output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may
also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not speci- fied,
the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path,
will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in
the specified source directory will be processed immediately
by CMake before processing in the current input file
continues beyond this command.</p>

<p>If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then
targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL
target of the par- ent directory by default, and will be
excluded from IDE project files. Users must explicitly build
targets in the subdirectory. This is meant for use when the
subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is
useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project()
command invocation so that a full build system will be
generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution
file). Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this
exclusion. If a target built by the parent project depends
on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be
included in the parent project build system to satisfy the
dependency.</p>

<p>add_test Add a test to the project with the specified
arguments.</p>

<p>add_test(testname Exename arg1 arg2 ...)</p>

<p>If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command
adds a test target to the current directory. If
ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing.
The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing
Exename with the specified argu- ments. Exename can be
either an executable built by this project or an arbitrary
executable on the system (like tclsh). The test will be run
with the current working directory set to the CMakeList.txt
files corresponding directory in the binary tree.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory Find all source files in a
directory.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Collects the names of all the source files in the
specified directory and stores the list in the
&lt;variable&gt; provided. This command is intended to be
used by projects that use explicit template instantiation.
Template instantiation files can be stored in a
&quot;Templates&quot; subdirectory and collected
automatically using this command to avoid manually listing
all instantiations.</p>

<p>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the
list of source files for a library or executable target.
While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to
generate a build system that knows when a new source file
has been added. Nor- mally the generated build system knows
when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file
is modified to add a new source. When the source is just
added to the directory without modifying this file, one
would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build
system incorporating the new file.</p>

<p>break Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>build_command Get the command line that will build this
project.</p>

<p>build_command(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;makecommand&gt;)</p>

<p>Sets the given &lt;variable&gt; to a string containing
the command that will build this project from the root of
the build tree using the build tool given by
&lt;makecommand&gt;. &lt;makecommand&gt; should be msdev,
nmake, make or one of the end user build tools. This is
useful for configuring testing systems.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]]
[FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be reset to use OLD behavior with a warning.
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given
CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about
their new policies. The policy version specified must be at
least 2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to
get compatibility features sup- porting versions earlier
than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are cre- ated and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(InputFile OutputFile [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY])</p>

<p>The Input and Output files have to have full paths. This
com- mand replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced
with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the
setting of VAR in CMake</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist Create a test driver and source
list for building test programs.</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName test1
test2 test3 EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h FUNCTION function)</p>

<p>A test driver is a program that links together many
small tests into a single executable. This is useful when
building static executables with large libraries to shrink
the total required size. The list of source files needed to
build the test driver will be in sourceListName. DriverName
is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the
arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be
semicolon separated. Each test source file should have a
function in it that is the same name as the file with no
extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);)
DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on
the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the
next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNC-
TION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a
function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av. This
can be used to add extra command line processing to each
test. The cmake vari- able CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN
can be set to have code that will be placed directly before
calling the test main func- tion.
CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that
will be placed directly after the call to the test main
function.</p>

<p>define_property Define and document custom
properties.</p>

<p>define_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE
| TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [INHERITED] BRIEF_DOCS &lt;brief-doc&gt;
FULL_DOCS &lt;full-doc&gt;)</p>

<p>Define one property in a scope for use with the
set_property and get_property commands. This is primarily
useful to associate documentation with property names that
may be retrieved with the get_property command. The first
argument determines the kind of scope in which the property
should be used. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL = associated with the global namespace DIRECTORY
= associated with one directory TARGET = associated with one
target SOURCE = associated with one source file TEST =
associated with a test named with add_test command VARIABLE
= documents a CMake language variable CACHED_VARIABLE =
documents a CMake cache variable</p>

<p>Note that unlike set_property and get_property no actual
scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is
important.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property being defined.</p>

<p>If the INHERITED option then the get_property command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested
property is not set in the scope given to the command.
DIRECTORY scope chains to GLOBAL. TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST
chain to DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by
strings to be associated with the property as its brief and
full documenta- tion. Corresponding options to the
get_property command will retrieve the documentation.</p>

<p>else Starts the else portion of an if block.</p>

<p>else(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.</p>

<p>elseif(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>enable_language Enable a language
(CXX/C/Fortran/etc)</p>

<p>enable_language(languageName [OPTIONAL] )</p>

<p>This command enables support for the named language in
CMake. This is the same as the project command but does not
create any of the extra variables that are created by the
project command. Example languages are CXX, C, Fortran.</p>

<p>If OPTIONAL is used, use the
CMAKE_&lt;languageName&gt;_COMPILER_WORKS variable to check
whether the language has been enabled success- fully.</p>

<p>enable_testing Enable testing for current directory and
below.</p>

<p>enable_testing()</p>

<p>Enables testing for this directory and below. See also
the add_test command. Note that ctest expects to find a test
file in the build directory root. Therefore, this command
should be in the source directory root.</p>

<p>endforeach Ends a list of commands in a FOREACH
block.</p>

<p>endforeach(expression)</p>

<p>execute_process Execute one or more child processes.</p>

<p>execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
[COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]] [WORKING_DIRECTORY

[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>export Export targets from the build tree for use by
outside projects.</p>

<p>export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE
&lt;namespace&gt;] [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt;)</p>

<p>Create a file &lt;filename&gt; that may be included by
outside projects to import targets from the current projects
build tree. This is useful during cross-compiling to build
utility executables that can run on the host platform in one
project and then import them into another project being
compiled for the target platform. If the NAMESPACE option is
given the &lt;names- pace&gt; string will be prepended to
all target names written to the file. If the APPEND option
is given the generated code will be appended to the file
instead of overwriting it. If a library target is included
in the export but a target to which it links is not included
the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>The file created by this command is specific to the
build tree and should never be installed. See the
install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an
installation tree.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(APPEND filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset]
[HEX]) file(STRINGS filename variable [LIMIT_COUNT num]
[LIMIT_INPUT numBytes] [LIMIT_OUTPUT numBytes]
[LENGTH_MINIMUM numBytes] [LENGTH_MAXIMUM numBytes]
[NEWLINE_CONSUME] [REGEX regex] [NO_HEX_CONVERSION])
file(GLOB variable [RELATIVE path] [globbing

file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [directory1 directory2 ...])
file(RELATIVE_PATH variable directory file)
file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result) file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path
result) file(DOWNLOAD url file [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS
status] [LOG log])</p>

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist.</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path.</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time can be specified as a
float.</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
documented by the package itself. The QUIET option disables
messages if the package cannot be found. The REQUIRED option
stops processing with an error mes- sage if the package
cannot be found. A package-specific list of components may
be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS
option if no REQUIRED option is given. The [version]
argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] is
given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the
[version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically
from the outer call. Version support is currently provided
only on a package-by-package basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found the command
proceeds to Config mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]] [NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly. It is also implied by use of options not
specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argu- ment is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
confguration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.
When a version file is found it is loaded to check the
requested ver- sion number. The version file is loaded in a
nested scope in which the following variables have been
defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested ver- sion and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/ (U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(share|lib)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/
(A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/
(A) &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/
(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). If
PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each
(W) or (U) directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>7. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot;. - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted

NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC

[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is

<p>fltk_wrap_ui Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1 source2 ...
sourceN )</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files
listed. The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a
variable named resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS which
should be added to your library.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var) foreach(loop_var
RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument
pass the last expected argument.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. Some supported
properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS,
MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(VAR [DIRECTORY dir] property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Directory. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, DEFINITIONS,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, LIST- FILE_STACK,
PARENT_DIRECTORY, and DEFINITION varname. If the DIRECTORY
argument is provided then the property of the provided
directory will be retrieved instead of the current
directory. You can only get properties of a directory during
or after it has been traversed by cmake.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName
PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME),
file exten- sion (EXT), file name without extension
(NAME_WE) of FileName, the full path (ABSOLUTE), or the full
path with all symlinks resolved (REALPATH). Note that the
path is converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing
slashes. The longest file extension is always considered. If
the optional CACHE argument is specified, the result
variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(VarName FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS ArgVar] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PRO- GRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in ArgVar. This is used to separate a
program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [SET |
DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property Get a property for a source
file.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property(VAR file property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a source file. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_source_files_properties to set property values. Source
file properties usually control how the file is built. One
property that is always there is LOCATION</p>

<p>get_target_property Get a property from a target.</p>

<p>get_target_property(VAR target property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a target. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_target_properties to set property values. Properties are
usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead. This com- mand can get properties
for any target so far created. The tar- gets do not need to
be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.</p>

<p>get_test_property Get a property of the test.</p>

<p>get_test_property(test VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Test. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
CMake will report an error. For a list of standard
properties you can type cmake --help-property-list</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the commands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise, the
com- mands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sec- tions are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the same expression must be given to if,
and endif. Long expressions can be used and the order or
precedence is that the EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED
operators will be evaluated first. Then any EQUAL, LESS,
GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be
evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators
will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is not empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(NOT variable)</p>

<p>True if the variables value is empty, 0, N, NO, OFF,
FALSE, NOTFOUND, or &lt;variable&gt;-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>if(variable1 AND variable2)</p>

<p>True if both variables would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(variable1 OR variable2)</p>

<p>True if either variable would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesn t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(variable MATCHES regex) if(string MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(variable LESS number) if(string LESS number)
if(variable GREATER number) if(string GREATER number)
if(variable EQUAL number) if(string EQUAL number)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(variable STRLESS string) if(string STRLESS string)
if(variable STRGREATER string) if(string STRGREATER string)
if(variable STREQUAL string) if(string STREQUAL string)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string on the right.</p>

<p>if(version1 VERSION_LESS version2) if(version1
VERSION_EQUAL version2) if(version1 VERSION_GREATER
version2)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED variable)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>include Read CMake listfile code from the given
file.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Reads CMake listfile code from the given file. Commands
in the file are processed immediately as if they were
written in place of the include command. If OPTIONAL is
present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.
If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to the
full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND if it
failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>include_directories Add include directories to the
build.</p>

<p>include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2
...)</p>

<p>Add the given directories to those searched by the
compiler for include files. By default the directories are
appended onto the current list of directories. This default
behavior can be changed by setting
CMAKE_include_directories_BEFORE to ON. By using BEFORE or
AFTER you can select between appending and prepending,
independent from the default. If the SYSTEM option is given
the compiler will be told that the directories are meant as
system include directories on some platforms.</p>

<p>include_external_msproject Include an external Microsoft
project file in a workspace.</p>

<p>include_external_msproject(projectname location dep1
dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated
workspace file. Currently does nothing on UNIX. This will
cre- ate a target named
INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_MSPROJECT_[projectname]. This can be used
in the add_dependencies command to make things depend on the
external project.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression Set the regular expression
used for dependency checking.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression(regex_match
[regex_complain])</p>

<p>Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking.
Only files matching regex_match will be traced as
dependencies. Only files matching regex_complain will
generate warnings if they cannot be found (standard header
paths are not searched). The defaults are:</p>

<p>regex_match = &quot;^.*$&quot; (match everything)
regex_complain = &quot;^$&quot; (match empty string
only)</p>

<p>install Specify rules to run at install time.</p>

<p>This command generates installation rules for a project.
Rules specified by calls to this command within a source
directory are executed in order during installation. The
order across direc- tories is not defined.</p>

<p>There are multiple signatures for this command. Some of
them define installation properties for files and targets.
Proper- ties common to multiple signatures are covered here
but they are valid only for signatures that specify
them.</p>

<p>DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to
which a file will be installed. If a full path (with a
leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.
If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to
the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed
files. Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE,
OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE,
WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.
Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are
ignored on those platforms.</p>

<p>The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build
configura- tions for which the install rule applies (Debug,
Release, etc.).</p>

<p>The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation
component name with which the install rule is associated,
such as &quot;runtime&quot; or &quot;development&quot;.
During component-specific installation only install rules
associated with the given component name will be executed.
During a full installation all components are installed.</p>

<p>The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed
file that may be different from the original file. Renaming
is allowed only when a single file is installed by the
command.</p>

<p>The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error
if the file to be installed does not exist.</p>

<p>The TARGETS signature:</p>

<p>install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
[[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE] [DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt;] [PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
[OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP] ] [...])</p>

<p>The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets
from a project. There are five kinds of target files that
may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and
BUNDLE. Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except
that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are
treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are
always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are
always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms
shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that
those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as
FRAMEWORK targets on OS X. For DLL platforms the DLL part of
a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the
corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE tar-
get. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
plat- forms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK
arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent
properties apply. If none is given the installation
properties apply to all target types. If only one is given
then only targets of that type will be installed (which can
be used to install just a DLL or just an import
library).</p>

<p>The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE
arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to
installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target s associated
files on non-Apple platforms. Rules defined by these
arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the
associated files are installed into the appropriate
locations inside the framework folder. See documentation of
the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target
properties for details.</p>

<p>Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified
as a LIBRARY option. On some platforms a versioned shared
library has a symbolic link such as</p>

<p>lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1</p>

<p>where &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1&quot; is the soname of
the library and &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so&quot; is a
&quot;namelink&quot; allowing linkers to find the library
when given &quot;-l&lt;name&gt;&quot;. The NAMELINK_ONLY
option causes installation of only the namelink when a
library target is installed. The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes
installation of library files other than the namelink when a
library target is installed. When neither option is given
both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned
shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is
not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library
and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing. See the
VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on
creating versioned shared libraries.</p>

<p>One or more groups of properties may be specified in a
single call to the TARGETS form of this command. A target
may be installed more than once to different locations.
Consider hypo- thetical targets &quot;myExe&quot;,
&quot;mySharedLib&quot;, and &quot;myStaticLib&quot;. The
code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib RUNTIME
DESTINATION bin LIBRARY DESTINATION lib ARCHIVE DESTINATION
lib/static) install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION
/some/full/path)</p>

<p>will install myExe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and myStaticLib
to &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/static. On non-DLL platforms
mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and
/some/full/path. On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will
be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and /some/full/path and
its import library will be installed to
&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path. On non-DLL
platforms mySharedLib will be installed to
&lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.</p>

<p>The EXPORT option associates the installed target files
with an export called &lt;export-name&gt;. It must appear
before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options. See
documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for
details.</p>

<p>Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true
has unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>The FILES signature:</p>

<p>install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for
a project. File names given as relative paths are
interpreted with respect to the current source directory.
Files installed by this form are by default given
permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and
WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argu- ment is given.</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS signature:</p>

<p>install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except
that the default permissions for the installed file also
include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.
This form is intended to install programs that are not
targets, such as shell scripts. Use the TARGETS form to
install targets built within the project.</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY signature:</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...] [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
permissions...] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
[FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX
&lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]]
[...])</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more
directories to a given destination. The directory structure
is copied ver- batim to the destination. The last component
of each directory name is appended to the destination
directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this
because it leaves the last com- ponent empty. Directory
names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect
to the current source directory. If no input directory names
are given the destination directory will be created but
nothing will be installed into it. The FILE_PER- MISSIONS
and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given
to files and directories in the destination. If
USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is
not, file permissions will be copied from the source
directory struc- ture. If no permissions are specified files
will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES
form of the command, and the directories will be given the
default permissions speci- fied in the PROGRAMS form of the
command.</p>

<p>Installation of directories may be controlled with fine
granu- larity using the PATTERN or REGEX options. These
&quot;match&quot; options specify a globbing pattern or
regular expression to match directories or files encountered
within input directories. They may be used to apply certain
options (see below) to a sub- set of the files and
directories encountered. The full path to each input file or
directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the
expression. A PATTERN will match only complete file names:
the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur
at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash. A
REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use
/ and $ to simulate the PATTERN behavior. By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are
matched. The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the
first match option to disable installation of files (but not
directories) not matched by any expression. For example, the
code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
FILES_MATCHING PATTERN &quot;*.h&quot;)</p>

<p>will extract and install header files from a source
tree.</p>

<p>Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression
and are applied only to files or directories matching them.
The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.
The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for
the matched file or directory. For example the code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION
share/myproj PATTERN &quot;CVS&quot; EXCLUDE PATTERN
&quot;scripts/*&quot; PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE
OWNER_READ GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)</p>

<p>will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons
and the scripts directory to share/myproj. The icons will
get default file permissions, the scripts will be given
specific permis- sions, and any CVS directories will be
excluded.</p>

<p>The SCRIPT and CODE signature:</p>

<p>install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]]
[...])</p>

<p>The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files
during installation. If the script file name is a relative
path it will be interpreted with respect to the current
source direc- tory. The CODE form will invoke the given
CMake code during installation. Code is specified as a
single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example,
the code</p>

<p>install(CODE &quot;MESSAGE(</p>

<p>will print a message during installation.</p>

<p>The EXPORT signature:</p>

<p>install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE
&lt;name&gt;.cmake] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT
&lt;component&gt;])</p>

<p>The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file
containing code to import targets from the installation tree
into another project. Target installations are associated
with the export &lt;export-name&gt; using the EXPORT option
of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above. The
NAMESPACE option will prepend &lt;namespace&gt; to the
target names as they are written to the import file. By
default the generated file will be called
&lt;export-name&gt;.cmake but the FILE option may be used to
specify a different name. The value given to the FILE option
must be a file name with the &quot;.cmake&quot; extension.
If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only
be installed when one of the named configurations is
installed. Additionally, the gener- ated import file will
reference only the matching target config- urations. If a
COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given
to the targets associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the
behavior is undefined. If a library target is included in
the export but a target to which it links is not included
the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use
targets built and installed by the current project. For
example, the code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION
lib/myproj)</p>

<p>will install the executable myexe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin
and code to import it in the file
&quot;&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake&quot;. An
outside project may load this file with the include command
and reference the myexe executable from the installation
tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the
target were built in its own tree.</p>

<p>NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS
command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and
POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT. It also replaces the FILES forms of the
INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands. The processing
order of these install rules relative to those generated by
INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS
commands is not defined.</p>

<p>link_directories Specify directories in which the linker
will look for libraries.</p>

<p>link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify the paths in which the linker should search for
libraries. The command will apply only to targets created
after it is called. For historical reasons, relative paths
given to this command are passed to the linker unchanged
(unlike many CMake commands which interpret them relative to
the current source directory).</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>load_cache Load in the values from another projects
CMake cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix
entry1...)</p>

<p>Read the cache and store the requested entries in
variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix.
This only reads the values, and does not create entries in
the local projects cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
[INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])</p>

<p>Load in the values from another cache and store them in
the local projects cache as internal entries. This is useful
for a project that depends on another project built in a
different tree. EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a list
of entries to be excluded. INCLUDE_INTERNALS can be used to
provide a list of internal entries to be included. Normally,
no internal entries are brought in. Use of this form of the
command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for
backward compati- bility.</p>

<p>load_command Load a command into a running CMake.</p>

<p>load_command(COMMAND_NAME &lt;loc1&gt; [loc2 ...])</p>

<p>The given locations are searched for a library whose
name is cmCOMMAND_NAME. If found, it is loaded as a module
and the com- mand is added to the set of available CMake
commands. Usually, TRY_COMPILE is used before this command
to compile the module. If the command is successfully loaded
a variable named</p>

<p>CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_&lt;COMMAND_NAME&gt;</p>

<p>will be set to the full path of the module that was
loaded. Otherwise the variable will not be set.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument pass the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables you should look at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result
in the output variable. Example mathematical expression is 5
* ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - * / % | &amp; ^ ~
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same meaning as they
do in c code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>

<p>message([SEND_ERROR | STATUS | FATAL_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>By default the message is displayed in a pop up window
(CMake- Setup), or in the stdout of cmake, or the error
section of ccmake. If the first argument is SEND_ERROR then
an error is raised, and the generate phase will be skipped.
If the first argument is FATAL_ERROR, all processing is
halted. If the first argument is STATUS then the message is
displayed in the progress line for the GUI, or with a -- in
the command line cmake.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>output_required_files Output a list of required source
files for a specified source file.</p>

<p>output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)</p>

<p>Outputs a list of all the source files that are required
by the specified srcfile. This list is written into
outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies
for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c
and .cpp files if possible.</p>

<p>project Set a name for the entire project.</p>

<p>project(&lt;projectname&gt; [languageName1 languageName2
... ] )</p>

<p>Sets the name of the project. Additionally this sets the
vari- ables &lt;projectName&gt;_BINARY_DIR and
&lt;projectName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR to the respective values.</p>

<p>Optionally you can specify which languages your project
sup- ports. Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C,
Fortran, etc. By default C and CXX are enabled. E.g. if you
do not have a C++ compiler, you can disable the check for it
by explicitely list- ing the languages you want to support,
e.g. C. By using the special language &quot;NONE&quot; all
checks for any language can be dis- abled.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp Create Qt Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists
...)</p>

<p>Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the
SourceLists. The moc files will be added to the library
using the DestName source list.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed
in the SourceLists. The .h files will be added to the
library using the HeadersDestNamesource list. The .cxx files
will be added to the library using the SourcesDestNamesource
list.</p>

<p>remove_definitions Removes -D define flags added by
add_definitions.</p>

<p>remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the
compiler com- mand line for sources in the current directory
and below.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Split space separated arguments into
a semi-colon separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;variable&gt; is put in the cache. &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are then required. &lt;type&gt; is used by
the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, then the &lt;value&gt; is
always written into the cache, replacing any values existing
in the cache. If it is not a cache variable, then this
always writes into the current makefile. The FORCE option
will overwrite the cache value remov- ing any changes by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand) If
VALUE is not specified then the variable is removed from the
parent scope.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will
be cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]]&gt; [APPEND] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt;
[value1 [value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties Source files can have
properties that affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties(file1 file2 ... PROPERTIES
prop1 value1 prop2 value2 ...)</p>

<p>Set properties on a file. The syntax for the command is
to list all the files you want to change, and then provide
the values you want to set next. You can make up your own
properties as well. The following are used by CMake. The
ABSTRACT flag (boolean) is used by some class wrapping
commands. If WRAP_EXCLUDE (boolean) is true then many
wrapping commands will ignore this file. If GENERATED
(boolean) is true then it is not an error if this source
file does not exist when it is added to a target. Obviously,
it must be created (presumably by a custom command) before
the target is built. If the HEADER_FILE_ONLY (boolean)
property is true then the file is not compiled. This is
useful if you want to add extra non build files to an IDE.
OBJECT_DEPENDS (string) adds dependencies to the object
file. COMPILE_FLAGS (string) is passed to the compiler as
additional command line arguments when the source file is
compiled. LAN- GUAGE (string) CXX|C will change the default
compiler used to compile the source file. The languages used
need to be enabled in the PROJECT command. If SYMBOLIC
(boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actu- ally created on disk but
instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.</p>

<p>set_target_properties Targets can have properties that
affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_target_properties(target1 target2 ... PROPERTIES
prop1 value1 prop2 value2 ...)</p>

<p>Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command
is to list all the files you want to change, and then
provide the val- ues you want to set next. You can use any
prop value pair you want and extract it later with the
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.</p>

<p>Properties that affect the name of a targets output file
are as follows. The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override
the default target name prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) and
suffix (such as &quot;.so&quot;). IMPORT_PREFIX and
IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import
library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).
OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built
and can be used to help create two targets of the same name
even though CMake requires unique logical target names.
There is also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the
output name on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of
the target when it is built under the configuration named by
&lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as
&quot;DEBUG_POSTFIX&quot;). The value of this property is
initialized when the target is created to the value of the
variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for executable
targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use
this variable for exe- cutables).</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL
sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then
it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some
substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier).
This is useful for headers to know whether they are being
included from inside their library our outside to properly
setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS
property sets additional compiler flags used to build
sources within the tar- get. It may also be used to pass
additional preprocessor defi- nitions.</p>

<p>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool
used to link an executable or shared library. The default is
set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and
C are common values for this property.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and api version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules.
INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the
rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that
support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that
if set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH.
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run
from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean
specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with
the INSTALL_RPATH. This takes precedence over
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relink- ing before
installation. INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specify- ing the
directory portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of
shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.
When the target is created the values of the variables
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH,
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and
CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these
properties.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the
target in an IDE like visual studio. VS_KEYWORD can be set
to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT
integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER
can be set to add support for source control bindings in a
Visual Studio project file.</p>

<p>When a library is built CMake by default generates code
to remove any existing library using all possible names.
This is needed to support libraries that switch between
STATIC and SHARED by a user option. However when using
OUTPUT_NAME to build a static and shared library of the same
name using differ- ent logical target names the two targets
will remove each others files. This can be prevented by
setting the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT property to 1.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the
visual studio generators. If it is set to 1 the target will
not be part of the default build when you select &quot;Build
Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties Set a property of the tests.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1
value1 prop2 value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the tests. If the property is not
found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include:</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL: If set to true, this will invert the
pass/fail flag of the test.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will be
checked against the specified regular expressions and at
least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise
the test will fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION &quot;TestPassed;All
ok&quot;</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will
match to one of specified regular expressions, the test will
fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>Both PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
expect a list of regular expressions.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>source_group Define a grouping for sources in the
makefile.</p>

<p>source_group(name [REGULAR_EXPRESSION regex] [FILES src1
src2 ...])</p>

<p>Defines a group into which sources will be placed in
project files. This is mainly used to setup file tabs in
Visual Studio. Any file whose name is listed or matches the
regular expression will be placed in this group. If a file
matches multiple groups, the LAST group that explicitly
lists the file will be favored, if any. If no group
explicitly lists the file, the LAST group whose regular
expression matches the file will be favored.</p>

<p>The name of the group may contain backslashes to specify
sub- groups:</p>

<p>source_group(outer\inner ...)</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, this command is also
supports the format:</p>

<p>source_group(name regex)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX
MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
&lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX REPLACE
&lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;replace_expression&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(REPLACE &lt;match_string&gt; &lt;replace_string&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(COMPARE EQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(COMPARE LESS &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE GREATER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(ASCII &lt;number&gt; [&lt;number&gt; ...] &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(CONFIGURE &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES]) string(TOUPPER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(TOLOWER
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(LENGTH
&lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(SUBSTRING
&lt;string&gt; &lt;begin&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(STRIP &lt;string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(RANDOM [LENGTH &lt;length&gt;]
[ALPHABET &lt;alphabet&gt;] &lt;output variable&gt;)</p>

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expres- sions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of a line $ Matches at end of a
line . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Matches any character
in range on either side of a dash * Matches preceding
pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding pattern one
or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
| Matches a pattern on either side of the | () Saves a
matched subexpression, which can be referenced in the REGEX
REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all regular
expression-related commands, including e.g. if( MATCHES ),
in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>target_link_libraries Link a target to given
libraries.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; [lib1 [lib2 [...]]]
[[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into the
specified tar- get. If any library name matches that of a
target in the current project a dependency will
automatically be added in the build system to make sure the
library being linked is up-to-date before the target
links.</p>

<p>A &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;optimized&quot;, or
&quot;general&quot; keyword indicates that the library
immediately following it is to be used only for the cor-
responding build configuration. The &quot;debug&quot;
keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to
configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global
property if it is set). The &quot;opti- mized&quot; keyword
corresponds to all other configurations. The
&quot;general&quot; keyword corresponds to all
configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).
Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration
rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.
See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more
information.</p>

<p>Library dependencies are transitive by default. When
this tar- get is linked into another target then the
libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line
for the other target too. See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
target property to over- ride the set of transitive link
dependencies for a target.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES [[debug|optimized|general]
&lt;lib&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries
to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration
equivalent target properties instead of using them for
linking. Libraries specified as &quot;debug&quot; are
appended to the the LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG
property (or to the properties correspond- ing to
configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global
property if it is set). Libraries specified as
&quot;optimized&quot; are appended to the the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property. Libraries specified as
&quot;general&quot; (or without any keyword) are treated as
if specified for both &quot;debug&quot; and
&quot;optimized&quot;.</p>

<p>try_compile Try compiling some code.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcdir projectName
&lt;targetname&gt; [CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE var])</p>

<p>Try compiling a program. In this form, srcdir should
contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file
and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted
after this command is run. If &lt;target name&gt; is
specified then build just that target otherwise the all or
ALL_BUILD target is built.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile [CMAKE_FLAGS
&lt;Flags&gt;] [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS &lt;flags&gt; ...]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE var] [COPY_FILE &lt;filename&gt; )</p>

<p>Try compiling a srcfile. In this case, the user need
only sup- ply a source file. CMake will create the
appropriate CMake- Lists.txt file to build the source. If
COPY_FILE is used, the compiled file will be copied to the
given file.</p>

<p>In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp,
will be cleaned automatically, for debugging a
--debug-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid the
clean. Some extra flags that can be included are,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are -Ddefinition that will be passed to
the compile line. try_compile creates a CMake- List.txt file
on the fly that looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions( &lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
calling cmake&gt;)
include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec
${LINK_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is
speci- fied, then the output from the build process is
stored in the given variable. Return the success or failure
in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass
-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the
build.</p>

<p>try_run Try compiling and then running some code.</p>

<p>try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile
[CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;] [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
&lt;flags&gt;] [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE comp]
[RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE run] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var] [ARGS
&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt;...])</p>

<p>Try compiling a srcfile. Return TRUE or FALSE for
success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR. Then if the
compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit
code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but
failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to
FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUT- PUT_VARIABLE specifies the
variable where the output from the compile step goes.
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output
from the running executable goes.</p>

<p>For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still
supported, which gives you the output from the compile and
run step com- bined.</p>

<p>Cross compiling issues</p>

<p>When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the
first step usually cannot be run on the build host.
try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect
whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If thats the case,
it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not
try to run the exe- cutable. Instead it will create cache
variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting
them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it would have been run on its actual
target platform. These vari- ables are RUN_RESULT_VAR
(explanation see above) and if RUN_OUT- PUT_VARIABLE (or
OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable
RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is
intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.</p>

<p>In order to make cross compiling your project easier,
use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really
required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling,
the cache variables will have to be set manually to the
output of the executable. You can also &quot;guard&quot; the
calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide
an easy-to-preset alterna- tive for this case.</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS build_name Deprecated. Use
${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMakeList.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the out- put. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies Deprecated. Use
INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.</p>

<p>This command generates an old-style library dependencies
file. Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use
the com- mand. Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to
help export targets from an installation tree and the
export() command to export targets from a build tree.</p>

<p>The old-style library dependencies file does not take
into account per-configuration names of libraries or the
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES target property.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])</p>

<p>Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included
into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command. The file
will contain a num- ber of SET commands that will set all
the variables needed for library dependency information.
This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project. If the APPEND option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given
file instead of replacing it.</p>

<p>install_files Deprecated. Use the install(FILES )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the
install com- mand. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed files with the given
exten- sion into the given directory. Only files existing in
the cur- rent source tree or its corresponding location in
the binary tree may be listed. If a file specified already
has an exten- sion, that extension will be removed first.
This is useful for providing lists of source files such as
foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be
installed. A typical extension is .h.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>Any files in the current source directory that match the
regular expression will be installed.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)</p>

<p>Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be
installed explicitly from the names given. Full paths are
allowed in this form.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_programs Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the
INSTALL command. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed programs into the
given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that
the file list version of the command will be used even when
there is only one argument.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>In the second form any program in the current source
directory that matches the regular expression will be
installed.</p>

<p>This command is intended to install programs that are
not built by cmake, such as shell scripts. See the TARGETS
form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for
targets built by cmake.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_targets Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.</p>

<p>install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir]
target target)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed targets into the
given direc- tory. The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to
the installation pre- fix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified,
then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL),
the files will be copied to that directory.</p>

<p>link_libraries Deprecated. Use the
target_link_libraries() command instead.</p>

<p>Link libraries to all targets added later.</p>

<p>link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt;
library2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any
following tar- gets (typically added with the add_executable
or add_library calls). This command is passed down to all
subdirectories. The debug and optimized strings may be used
to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only
for that specific type of build.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>subdir_depends Deprecated. Does nothing.</p>

<p>subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Does not do anything. This command used to help projects
order parallel builds correctly. This functionality is now
automatic.</p>

<p>subdirs Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command
instead.</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build.</p>

<p>subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1
exclude_dir2 ...] [PREORDER] )</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The
add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs
although subdirs will still work. This will cause any
CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed
by CMake. Any directories after the PREORDER flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the PRE- ORDER flag has
no effect on IDE projects. Any directories after the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top
level makefile or project file. This is useful for having
CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in
a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you
would not want them to show up in the top level project or
be built each time make is run from the top.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa Copy mesa headers for use in
combination with system GL.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)</p>

<p>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.
The mesa headers are copied to the specified output
directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override
other GL headers by being added to the include directory
path earlier.</p>

<p>utility_source Specify the source tree of a third-party
utility.</p>

<p>utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])</p>

<p>When a third-party utilitys source is included in the
distribu- tion, this command specifies its location and
name. The cache entry will not be set unless the
path_to_source and all listed files exist. It is assumed
that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.</p>

<p>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a
util- ity_source() command is executed, because in many
cases it is used to build an executable which is executed
later on. This doesn t work when cross compiling, since the
executable can run only on their target platform. So in this
case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build
host.</p>

<p>variable_requires Deprecated. Use the if() command
instead.</p>

<p>Assert satisfaction of an option s required
variables.</p>

<p>variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
REQUIRED_VARIABLE1 REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)</p>

<p>The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the
variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing
else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next
argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true
if all the required variables are set. The rest of the
arguments are variables that must be true or not set to
NOTFOUND to avoid an error. If any are not true, an error is
reported.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>
