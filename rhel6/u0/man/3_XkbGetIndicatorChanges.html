<p>XkbGetIndicatorChanges(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetIndicatorChanges(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetIndicatorChanges - Updates a local copy of
the keyboard descrip- tion with the actual values of one or
more calls to XkbNoteIndicator- Changes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetIndicatorChanges (Display *dpy,
XkbDescPtr xkb, XkbIndica- torChangesPtr changes, unsigned
int state);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to the X server</p>

<p>- xkb keyboard description to hold the new values</p>

<p>- changes indicator maps/state to be obtained from the
server</p>

<p>- state backfilled with the state of the indicators</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Whenever an indicator changes state, the
server sends XkbIndica- torStateNotify events to all
interested clients. Similarly, whenever an indicator s map
changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to
all interested clients.</p>

<p>To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use
XkbSelectEvents with both the bits_to_change and
values_for_bits parameters containing
XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask. To receive
XkbIndicatorMapNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with
XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.</p>

<p>To receive events for only specific indicators, use
XkbSelectEventDe- tails. Set the event_type parameter to
XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, and set
both the bits_to_change and val- ues_for_bits detail
parameters to a mask where each bit specifies one indicator,
turning on those bits that specify the indicators for which
you want to receive events.</p>

<p>Both types of indicator events use the same
structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify { int type; / Xkb
extension base event code */ unsigned long serial; / X
server serial number for event */ Bool send_event; / True
=&gt; synthetically generated */ Display * display; / server
connection where event generated */ Time time; / server time
when event generated */ int xkb_type; / specifies state or
map notify */ int device; / Xkb device ID, will not be
XkbUseCoreKbd */ unsigned int changed; / mask of indicators
with new state or map */ unsigned int state; / current state
of all indicators */ } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;</p>

<p>xkb_type is either XkbIndicatorStateNotify or
XkbIndicatorMapNotify, depending on whether the event is a
kbIndicatorStateNotify event or kbIndicatorMapNotify
event.</p>

<p>The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise
inclusive OR of the indicators that have changed. If the
event is of type XkbIndicatorMap- Notify, changed reports
the maps that changed. If the event is of type
XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that
have changed state. state is a mask that specifies the
current state of all indicators, whether they have changed
or not, for both XkbIndicatorStateNotify and
IndicatorMapNotify events.</p>

<p>When your client application receives either a
XkbIndicatorStateNotify event or XkbIndicatorMapNotify
event, you can note the changes in a changes structure by
calling XkbNoteIndicatorChanges.</p>

<p>XkbGetIndicatorChanges examines the changes parameter,
pulls over the necessary information from the server, and
copies the results into the xkb keyboard description. If any
bits are set in the state_changes field of changes,
XkbGetIndicatorChanges also places the state of those
indicators in state. If the indicators field of xkb is NULL,
XkbGetIndicatorChanges allocates and initializes it. To free
the indi- cators field, use XkbFreeIndicators.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadImplementation Invalid reply from server</p>

<p>BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not available
in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but
is otherwise invalid</p>
