<p>SNMPD.INTERNAL(5) Net-SNMP SNMPD.INTERNAL(5)</p>

<p>NAME snmpd.internal - internal configuration of the
Net-SNMP agent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The snmpd.conf(5) man page defines the
syntax and behaviour of the main configuration directives
that can be used to control the operation of the Net-SNMP
agent, and the management information it provides.</p>

<p>However there are several other configuration directives
(many of which, though not all, start with a leading
underscore) that are recog- nised by the agent. These are
typically used to retain configuration across agent
restarts, and are not intended for direct user access. This
man page list these directives, giving a brief indication of
where they are used. For full details - see the relevant
source files. If you cant follow that source, you probably
shouldn t be fiddling with these directives!</p>

<p>AGENT BEHAVIOUR quit</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL VACM Configuration vacmView / vacmGroup /
vacmAccess These directives are used to retain dynamically
configured access control settings.</p>

<p>SYSTEM INFORMATION System Group setSerialNo This
directive is used to implement the advisory lock object
snmpSetSerialNo.</p>

<p>psyslocation / psyscontact / psysname These directives
are used to retain dynamically configured sys- tem settings.
They will be overridden by the corresponding sys- Location,
sysContact and sysName directives.</p>

<p>ACTIVE MONITORING Notification Handling pauthtrapenable
This directive is used to retain the dynamically configured
set- ting of whether the agent should generate
authenticationFailure traps. It will be overridden by the
corresponding authtrapen- able directive.</p>

<p>snmpNotify*Table</p>

<p>targetAddr / targetParams These directives are used to
retain dynamically configured noti- fication destination
settings.</p>

<p>DisMan Event MIB _mteE*Table, _mteOTable, _mteT*Table
These directives are used to retain dynamically configured
event, object and monitor trigger settings.</p>

<p>mteObjectsTable / mteTriggerTable These directives are
for compatibility with the previous dis- man/event-mib
implementation.</p>

<p>DisMan Schedule MIB _schedTable This directive is used
to retain dynamically configured sched- uled events.</p>

<p>EXTENDING AGENT FUNCTIONALITY Arbitrary Extension
Commands extend-sh</p>

<p>exec2 / sh2 / execFix2 These directives were defined by
analogy with equivalent direc- tives in the previous
ucd-snmp/extensible implementation. They are deprecated, and
should not be used.</p>
