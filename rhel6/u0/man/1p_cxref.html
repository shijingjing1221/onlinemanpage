<p>CXREF(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CXREF(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cxref - generate a C-language program
cross-reference table (DEVELOP- MENT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cxref [-cs][-o file][-w num] [-D
name[=def]]...[-I dir]... [-U name]... file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cxref utility shall analyze a collection
of C-language files and attempt to build a cross-reference
table. Information from #define lines shall be included in
the symbol table. A sorted listing shall be written to
standard output of all symbols (auto, static, and global) in
each file separately, or with the -c option, in combination.
Each sym- bol shall contain an asterisk before the declaring
reference.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cxref utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that the order of the -D,
-I, and -U options (which are identical to their
interpretation by c99) is significant. The following options
shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Write a combined cross-reference of all input
files.</p>

<p>-s Operate silently; do not print input filenames.</p>

<p>-o file Direct output to named file.</p>

<p>-w num Format output no wider than num (decimal)
columns. This option defaults to 80 if num is not specified
or is less than 51.</p>

<p>-D Equivalent to c99.</p>

<p>-I Equivalent to c99.</p>

<p>-U Equivalent to c99.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a C-language source file.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files are C-language source
files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cxref:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the ordering of the output.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be used for the
cross-reference listing, unless the -o option is used to
select a different output file.</p>

<p>The format of standard output is unspecified, except
that the following information shall be included:</p>

<p>* If the -c option is not specified, each portion of the
listing shall start with the name of the input file on a
separate line.</p>

<p>* The name line shall be followed by a sorted list of
symbols, each with its associated location pathname, the
name of the function in which it appears (if it is not a
function name itself), and line number references.</p>

<p>* Each line number may be preceded by an asterisk (*)
flag, mean- ing that this is the declaring reference. Other
single-character flags, with implementation-defined
meanings, may be included.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output file named by the -o option
shall be used instead of stan- dard output.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
