<p>SG_VPD(8) SG3_UTILS SG_VPD(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_vpd - fetches Vital Product Data (VPD) pages
using a SCSI INQUIRY command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_vpd [--enumerate] [--help] [--hex] [--ident]
[--long] [--maxlen=LEN] [--page=PG] [--quiet] [--raw]
[--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility fetches a Vital Product Data
page and decodes it or out- puts it in ASCII hexadecimal or
binary. VPD pages are fetched with a SCSI INQUIRY
command.</p>

<p>Probably the most important page is the Device
Identification VPD page (page number: 0x83). Since SPC-3,
support for this page has been flagged as mandatory. This
page can be fetched by using the --ident option.</p>

<p>When no options are given, other than a DEVICE, then the
&quot;Supported VPD pages&quot; (0x0) VPD page is fetched
and decoded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The options are arranged in
alphabetical order based on the long option name.</p>

<p>-e, --enumerate list the names of the known VPD pages,
first the standard pages, then the vendor specific pages.
Each group is sorted in abbrevi- ation order. The DEVICE and
other options are ignored and this utility exits afte
listing the VPD page names.</p>

<p>-h, --help outputs the usage message summarizing command
line options then exits. Ignores DEVICE if given.</p>

<p>-H, --hex outputs the requested VPD page in ASCII
hexadecimal. Can be used multiple times, see section on the
ATA information vpd page.</p>

<p>-i, --ident decode the device identification (0x83) VPD
page. When used once this option has the same effect as
--page=di . When use twice then the short form of the device
identification VPD pages log- ical unit designator is
decoded. In the latter case this option has the same effect
as --quiet --page=di_lu.</p>

<p>-l, --long when decoding some VPD pages, give a little
more output. For example the ATA Information VPD page only
shows the signature (in hex) and the IDENTIFY (PACKET)
DEVICE (in hex) when this option is given.</p>

<p>-m, --maxlen=LEN where LEN is the (maximum) response
length in bytes. It is placed in the cdbs &quot;allocation
length&quot; field. If not given (or LEN is zero) then 252
is used (apart from the ATA Information VPD page which
defaults to 572) and, if the response indicates this value
is insufficient, another INQUIRY command is sent with a
larger value in the cdbs &quot;allocation length&quot;
field. If this option is given and LEN is greater than 0
then only one INQUIRY command is sent. Since many simple
devices implement the INQUIRY command badly (and do not
support VPD pages) then the safest value to use for LEN is
36. See the sg_inq man page for the more information.</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG where PG is the VPD page to be decoded or
output. The PG argu- ment can either be an abbreviation, a
number or a pair or num- bers separated by a comma. The VPD
page abbreviations can be seen by using the --enumerate
option. If a number is given it is assumed to be decimal
unless it has a hexadecimal indicator which is either a
leading 0x or a trailing h. If one number is given then it
is assumed to be a VPD page number. If two num- bers are
given the second number indicates which vendor specific VPD
page to decode when several pages share the same VPD page
number. If this option is not given (nor -i, -l nor -V) then
the &quot;Supported VPD pages&quot; (0x0) VPD page is
fetched and decoded.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet suppress the amount of decoding output.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output requested VPD page in binary. The
output should be piped to a file or another utility when
this option is used. The binary is sent to stdout, and
errors are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increases the level or verbosity.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>ATA INFORMATION VPD PAGE This VPD page (0x89 or ai) is
defined by the SCSI to ATA Translation standard. It contains
information about the SAT layer, the &quot;signature&quot;
of the ATA device and the response to the ATA IDENTIFY
(PACKET) DEVICE command. The latter part has 512 bytes of
identity, capability and set- tings data which the hdparm
utility is capable of decoding (so this utility doesnt
decode it).</p>

<p>To unclutter the output for this page, the signature and
the IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response are not output unless
the --long option (or --hex or --raw) are given. When the
--long option is given the IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response
is output as 256 (16 bit) words as is the fashion for ATA
devices. To see that response as a string of bytes use the
-HH option. To format the output suitable for hdparm to
decode use either the -HHH or -rr option. For example if
dev/sdb is a SATA disk behind a SAT layer then this command:
sg_vpd -p ai -HHH /dev/sdb | hdparm --Istdin should decode
the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE response.</p>

<p>NOTES In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must
be a SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block
devices (e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified.
For example &quot;sg_inq /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI &quot;char&quot;
device names may be used as well (e.g.
&quot;/dev/st0m&quot;).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_vpd is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
