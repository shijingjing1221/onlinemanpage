<p>NAME ntp_mon - Monitoring Options</p>

<p>ntpd includes a comprehensive monitoring facility
suitable for continu- ous, long term recording of server and
client timekeeping performance. See the statistics command
below for a listing and example of each type of statistics
currently supported. Statistic files are managed using file
generation sets and scripts in the ./scripts directory of
this distribution. Using these facilities and Unix cron
jobs, the datacan be automatically summarized and archived
for retrospective analysis.</p>

<p>MONITORING COMMANDS statistics name [...] Enables
writing of statistics records. Currently, six kinds of
namestatistics are supported.</p>

<p>clockstats Enables recording of clock driver statistics
informa- tion. Each update received from a clock driver
appends a line of the following form to the file generation
set named clockstats: 49213 525.624 127.127.4.1 93 226
00:08:29.606 D The first two fields show the date (Mod-
ified Julian Day) and time (seconds and fraction past UTC
midnight). The next field shows the clock address in
dotted-quad notation, The final field shows the last
timecode received from the clock in decoded ASCII for- mat,
where meaningful. In some clock drivers a good deal of
additional information can be gathered and dis- played as
well. See information specific to each clock for further
details.</p>

<p>cryptostats This option requires the OpenSSL
cryptographic software library. It enables recording of
cryptographic public key protocol information. Each message
received by the protocol module appends a line of the
following form to the file generation set named cryptostats:
49213 525.624 127.127.4.1 message The first two fields show
the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds and
fraction past UTC midnight). The next field shows the peer
address in dotted-quad notation, The final message field
includes the message type and certain ancillary information.
See the Authentication Options page for further
information.</p>

<p>loopstats Enables recording of loop filter statistics
informa- tion. Each update of the local clock outputs a line
of the following form to the file generation set named
loopstats: 50935 75440.031 0.000006019 13.778190 0.000351733
0.0133806 6 The first two fields show the date (Modified
Julian Day) and time (seconds and frac- tion past UTC
midnight). The next five fields show time offset (seconds),
frequency offset (parts per million - PPM), RMS jitter
(seconds), Allan deviation (PPM) and clock discipline time
constant.</p>

<p>peerstats Enables recording of peer statistics
information. This includes statistics records of all peers
of a NTP server and of special signals, where present and
con- figured. Each valid update appends a line of the fol-
lowing form to the current element of a file generation set
named peerstats:</p>

<p>48773 10847.650 127.127.4.1 9714 -0.001605376
0.000000000 0.001424877 0.000958674 The first two fields
show the date (Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds and
fraction past UTC midnight). The next two fields show the
peer address in dotted- quad notation and status,
respectively. The status field is encoded in hex in the
format described in Appendix B of the NTP specification RFC
1305. The final four fields show the offset, delay,
dispersion and RMS jitter, all in seconds.</p>

<p>rawstats Enables recording of raw-timestamp statistics
informa- tion. This includes statistics records of all peers
of a NTP server and of special signals, where present and
configured. Each NTP message received from a peer or clock
driver appends a line of the following form to the file
generation set named rawstats:</p>

<p>50928 2132.543 128.4.1.1 128.4.1.20 3102453281.584327000
3102453281.58622800031 02453332.540806000
3102453332.541458000 The first two fields show the date
(Modified Julian Day) and time (seconds and fraction past
UTC midnight). The next two fields show the remote peer or
clock address followed by the local address in dotted-quad
notation, The final four fields show the originate, receive,
transmit and final NTP timestamps in order. The timestamp
values are as received and before pro- cessing by the
various data smoothing and mitigation algorithms.</p>

<p>sysstats Enables recording of ntpd statistics counters
on a periodic basis. Each hour a line of the following form
is appended to the file generation set named sysstats: 50928
2132.543 36000 81965 0 9546 56 71793 512 540 10 147 The
first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and
time (seconds and fraction past UTC midnight). The remaining
ten fields show the statistics counter values accumulated
since the last generated line.</p>

<p>Time since restart 36000 Time in hours since the system
was last rebooted.</p>

<p>Packets received 81965 Total number of packets
received.</p>

<p>Packets processed 0 Number of packets received in
response to pre- vious packets sent</p>

<p>Current version 9546 Number of packets matching the
current NTP ver- sion.</p>

<p>Previous version 56 Number of packets matching the
previous NTP version.</p>

<p>Bad version 71793 Number of packets matching neither NTP
version.</p>

<p>Access denied 512 Number of packets denied access for
any reason.</p>

<p>Bad length or format 540 Number of packets with invalid
length, format or port number.</p>

<p>Bad authentication 10 Number of packets not verified as
authentic.</p>

<p>Rate exceeded 147 Number of packets discarded due to
rate limita- tion.</p>

<p>timingstats ONLY available when the deamon is compiled
with process time debugging support (--enable-debug-timing -
costs performance). Enables recording of ntpd processing
time information for various selected code paths: 53876
36.920 10.0.3.5 1 0.000014592 input processing delay The
first two fields show the date (Modified Julian Day) and
time (seconds and fraction past UTC midnight). The next
field is a potential peer address, - or -REF- CLOCK-
depending on the associated io source. Then an event count
for the number of processed events in the code path follows.
The fifth field is the total time spend for the events. The
rest of the line denotes the code path description (see
source for more informa- tion).</p>

<p>statsdir directory_path Indicates the full path of a
directory where statistics files should be created (see
below). This keyword allows the (otherwise constant) filegen
filename prefix to be modified for file generation sets,
which is use- ful for handling statistics logs.</p>

<p>filegen name [file filename] [type typename] [link |
nolink] [enable | disable] Configures setting of generation
file set name. Genera- tion file sets provide a means for
handling files that are continuously growing during the
lifetime of a server. Server statistics are a typical
example for such files. Generation file sets provide access
to a set of files used to store the actual data. At any time
at most one element of the set is being written to. The type
given specifies when and how data will be directed to a new
element of the set. This way, information stored in elements
of a file set that are currently unused are available for
administrational operations without the risk of disturbing
the operation of ntpd. (Most important: they can be removed
to free space for new data produced.) Note that this command
can be sent from the ntpdc program running at a remote
location.</p>

<p>name This is the type of the statistics records, as
shown in the statistics command.</p>

<p>file filename This is the file name for the statistics
records. Filenames of set members are built from three
concatenated elements prefix, file- name and suffix:</p>

<p>prefix This is a constant filename path. It is not
subject to modifications via the filegen option. It is
defined by the server, usually specified as a compile- time
constant. It may, however, be con- figurable for individual
file genera- tion sets via other commands. For exam- ple,
the prefix used with loopstats and peerstats generation can
be configured using the statsdir option explained above.</p>

<p>filename This string is directly concatenated to the
prefix mentioned above (no inter- vening / (slash)). This
can be modified using the file argument to the filegen
statement. No .. elements are allowed in this component to
prevent filenames referring to parts outside the filesys-
tem hierarchy denoted by prefix.</p>

<p>suffix This part is reflects individual ele- ments of a
file set. It is generated according to the type of a file
set.</p>

<p>type typename A file generation set is characterized by
its type. The following types are supported:</p>

<p>none The file set is actually a single plain file.</p>

<p>pid One element of file set is used per incarnation of a
ntpd server. This type does not perform any changes to file
set members during runtime, however it provides an easy way
of separating files belonging to different ntpd server
incarnations. The set member filename is built by appending
a . (dot) to concatenated prefix and file- name strings, and
appending the decimal representation of the process ID of
the ntpd server process.</p>

<p>day One file generation set element is cre- ated per
day. A day is defined as the period between 00:00 and 24:00
UTC. The file set member suffix consists of a . (dot) and a
day specification in the form YYYYMMdd. YYYY is a 4-digit
year number (e.g., 1992). MM is a two digit month number. dd
is a two digit day number. Thus, all information written at
10 December 1992 would end up in a file named prefix
filename.19921210.</p>

<p>week Any file set member contains data related to a
certain week of a year. The term week is defined by
computing day-of-year modulo 7. Elements of such a file
generation set are distinguished by appending the following
suffix to the file set filename base: A dot, a 4-digit year
number, the letter W, and a 2-digit week number. For
example, information from January, 10th 1992 would end up in
a file with suffix .1992W1.</p>

<p>month One generation file set element is gen- erated per
month. The file name suffix consists of a dot, a 4-digit
year num- ber, and a 2-digit month.</p>

<p>year One generation file element is gener- ated per
year. The filename suffix con- sists of a dot and a 4 digit
year num- ber.</p>

<p>age This type of file generation sets changes to a new
element of the file set every 24 hours of server operation.
The filename suffix consists of a dot, the letter a, and an
8-digit number. This number is taken to be the number of
seconds the server is running at the start of the
corresponding 24-hour period. Information is only written to
a file generation by specifying enable; output is prevented
by specifying dis- able.</p>

<p>link | nolink It is convenient to be able to access the
cur- rent element of a file generation set by a fixed name.
This feature is enabled by specify- ing link and disabled
using nolink. If link is specified, a hard link from the
current file set element to a file without suffix is cre-
ated. When there is already a file with this name and the
number of links of this file is one, it is renamed appending
a dot, the letter C, and the pid of the ntpd server process.
When the number of links is greater than one, the file is
unlinked. This allows the current file to be accessed by a
constant name.</p>

<p>enable | disable Enables or disables the recording
function.</p>
