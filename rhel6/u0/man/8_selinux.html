<p>NAME selinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an
implementation of a flexi- ble mandatory access control
architecture in the Linux operating sys- tem. The SELinux
architecture provides general support for the enforcement of
many kinds of mandatory access control policies, includ- ing
those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement&reg;, Role-
Based Access Control, and Multi-Level Security. Background
information and technical documentation about SELinux can be
found at http://www.nsa.gov/selinux.</p>

<p>The /etc/selinux/config configuration file controls
whether SELinux is enabled or disabled, and if enabled,
whether SELinux operates in per- missive mode or enforcing
mode. The SELINUX variable may be set to any one of
disabled, permissive, or enforcing to select one of these
options. The disabled option completely disables the SELinux
kernel and application code, leaving the system running
without any SELinux protection. The permissive option
enables the SELinux code, but causes it to operate in a mode
where accesses that would be denied by policy are permitted
but audited. The enforcing option enables the SELinux code
and causes it to enforce access denials as well as auditing
them. Permissive mode may yield a different set of denials
than enforcing mode, both because enforcing mode will
prevent an operation from pro- ceeding past the first denial
and because some application code will fall back to a less
privileged mode of operation if denied access.</p>

<p>The /etc/selinux/config configuration file also controls
what policy is active on the system. SELinux allows for
multiple policies to be installed on the system, but only
one policy may be active at any given time. At present, two
kinds of SELinux policy exist: targeted and strict. The
targeted policy is designed as a policy where most pro-
cesses operate without restrictions, and only specific
services are placed into distinct security domains that are
confined by the policy. For example, the user would run in a
completely unconfined domain while the named daemon or
apache daemon would run in a specific domain tai- lored to
its operation. The strict policy is designed as a policy
where all processes are partitioned into fine-grained
security domains and confined by policy. It is anticipated
in the future that other policies will be created
(Multi-Level Security for example). You can define which
policy you will run by setting the SELINUXTYPE environment
variable within /etc/selinux/config. The corresponding
policy configu- ration for each such policy must be
installed in the /etc/selinux/SELINUXTYPE/ directories.</p>

<p>A given SELinux policy can be customized further based
on a set of com- pile-time tunable options and a set of
runtime policy booleans. sys- tem-config-securitylevel
allows customization of these booleans and tunables.</p>

<p>Many domains that are protected by SELinux also include
selinux man pages explainging how to customize their
policy.</p>

<p>FILE LABELING All files, directories, devices ... have a
security context/label asso- ciated with them. These context
are stored in the extended attributes of the file system.
Problems with SELinux often arise from the file system being
mislabeled. This can be caused by booting the machine with a
non selinux kernel. If you see an error message containing
file_t, that is usually a good indicator that you have a
serious problem with file system labeling.</p>

<p>The best way to relabel the file system is to create the
flag file /.autorelabel and reboot.
system-config-securitylevel, also has this capability. The
restorcon/fixfiles commands are also available for
relabeling files.</p>
