<p>DEV_GETBYHWADDR(9) Network device support
DEV_GETBYHWADDR(9)</p>

<p>NAME dev_getbyhwaddr - find a device by its hardware
address</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct net_device * dev_getbyhwaddr(struct net
* net, unsigned short type, char * ha);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS net the applicable net namespace</p>

<p>type media type of device</p>

<p>ha hardware address</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Search for an interface by MAC address.
Returns NULL if the device is not found or a pointer to the
device. The caller must hold the rtnl semaphore. The
returned device has not had its ref count increased and the
caller must therefore be careful about locking</p>

<p>BUGS If the API was consistent this would be
__dev_get_by_hwaddr</p>
