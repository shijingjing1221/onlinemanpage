<p>UNALIAS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNALIAS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME unalias - remove alias definitions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unalias alias-name...</p>

<p>unalias -a</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unalias utility shall remove the
definition for each alias name specified. See Alias
Substitution . The aliases shall be removed from the current
shell execution environment; see Shell Execution Environ-
ment .</p>

<p>OPTIONS The unalias utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Remove all alias definitions from the current shell
execution environment.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>alias-name The name of an alias to be removed.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of una- lias:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 One of the alias-name operands specified did not
represent a valid alias definition, or an error
occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since unalias affects the current
shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a
shell regular built-in.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The unalias description is based on that from
historical KornShell implementations. Known differences
exist between that and the C shell. The KornShell version
was adopted to be consistent with all the other KornShell
features in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, such as
com- mand line editing.</p>

<p>The -a option is the equivalent of the unalias * form of
the C shell and is provided to address security concerns
about unknown aliases entering the environment of a user (or
application) through the allow- able implementation-defined
predefined alias route or as a result of an ENV file.
(Although unalias could be used to simplify the
&quot;secure&quot; shell script shown in the command
rationale, it does not obviate the need to quote all command
names. An initial call to unalias -a would have to be quoted
in case there was an alias for unalias.)</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
