<p>NAME sasl_authorize_t - The SASL authorization
callback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_authorize_t(void *context, const char
*requested_user, unsigned alen, const char *auth_identity,
unsigned alen, const char *def_realm, unsigned urlen, struct
propctx *propctx)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_authorize_t is used to check whether
the authorized user auth_identity may act as the user
requested_user. For example the user root may wish to
authenticate with his credentials but act as the user
tmartin (with all of tmartins rights not roots). A server
application should be very careful, and probably err on the
side of caution, when determining which users may proxy as
whom.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE SASL callback functions should return SASL
return codes. See sasl.h for a complete list. SASL_OK
indicates success.</p>
