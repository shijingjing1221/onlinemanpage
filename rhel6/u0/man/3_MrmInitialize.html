<p>MrmInitialize(library call) MrmInitialize(library
call)</p>

<p>NAME MrmInitialize Prepares an application to use MRM
widget-fetching facilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void MrmInitialize(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmInitialize function must be called to
prepare an application to use MRM widget-fetching
facilities. You must call this function prior to fetching a
widget. However, it is good programming practice to call
MrmInitialize prior to performing any MRM operations.</p>

<p>MrmInitialize initializes the internal data structures
that MRM needs to successfully perform type conversion on
arguments and to success- fully access widget creation
facilities. An application must call MrmInitialize before it
uses other MRM functions.</p>
