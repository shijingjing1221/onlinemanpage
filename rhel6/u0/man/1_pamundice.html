<p>NAME pamundice - combine grid of images (tiles) into
one</p>

<p>EXAMPLE $ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part
-width=10 -height=8 $ pamundice myimage_part_%1d_%1a.ppm
-across=10 -down=8 &gt;myimage.ppm</p>

<p>$ pamundice myimage.ppm myimage_part_%2a -across=13
-hoverlap=9</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamundice</p>

<p>[-across=n]</p>

<p>[-down=n]</p>

<p>[-hoverlap=pixels]</p>

<p>[-voverlap=pixels]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>input_filename_pattern</p>

<p>You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the
options. You can use two hyphens instead of one. You can
separate an option name from its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamundice reads a bunch of PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM images
as input and combines them as a grid of tiles into a single
output image of the same kind on Standard Output.</p>

<p>You can optionally make the pieces overlap.</p>

<p>See the input_filename_pattern argument for information
on naming of the input files.</p>

<p>The input images must all have the same format (PAM,
PPM, etc.) and maxval and for PAM must have the same depth
and tuple type. All the images in a rank (horizontal row of
tiles) must have the same height. All the images in a file
(vertical column of tiles) must have the same width. But it
is not required that every rank have the same height or
every file have the same width.</p>

<p>pamdice is the inverse of pamundice. You can use
pamundice to reassem- ble an image sliced up by pamdice. You
can use pamdice to recreate the tiles of an image created by
pamundice, but to do this the original ranks must all have
been the same height except for the bottom one and the
original files must all have been the same width except the
right one.</p>

<p>One use for this is to make pieces that take less
computer resources than the whole image to process. For
example, you might have an image so large that an image
editor can t read it all into memory or pro- cesses it very
slowly. You can split it into smaller pieces with pamdice,
edit one at a time, and then reassemble them with
pamundice.</p>

<p>An alternative to join images in a single direction
(i.e. a single rank or a single file) is pnmcat. pnmcat
gives you more flexibility than pamundice in identifying the
input images: you can supply them on Stan- dard Input or as
a list of arbitrarily named files.</p>

<p>To join piecewise photographs, use pnmstitch instead of
pamundice, because it figures out where the pieces overlap,
even if they dont overlap exactly vertically or
horizontally.</p>

<p>To create an image of the same tile repeated in a grid,
thats pnmtile.</p>

<p>pnmindex does a similar thing to pamundice: it combines
a bunch of small images in a grid into a big one. But its
purpose is to produce a an index image of the input images.
So it leaves space between them and has labels for them, for
example.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS There is one non-option argument, and it is
mandatory: input_file- name_pattern. This tells pamundice
what files contain the input tiles.</p>

<p>pamundice reads the input images from files which are
named with a pat- tern that indicates their positions in the
combined image. For exam- ple, tile_00_05.ppm could be the
6th tile over in the 1st rank, while tile_04_01 is the 2nd
tile over in the 5th rank.</p>

<p>You cannot supply any of the data on Standard Input, and
the files must be the kind that pamundice can close and
reopen and read the same image a second time (e.g. a regular
file is fine; a named pipe is probably not).</p>

<p>input_filename_pattern is a printf-style pattern. (See
the standard C library printf subroutine). For the example
above, it would be tile_%2d_%2a.ppm. The only possible
conversion specifiers are:</p>

<p>d down: The rank (row) number, starting with 0.</p>

<p>a across: The file (column) number, starting with 0.</p>

<p>% The per cent character (%).</p>

<p>The number between the % and the conversion specifier is
the precision and is required. It says how many characters
of the file name are described by that conversion. The rank
or file number is filled with leading zeroes as
necessary.</p>

<p>So the example tile_%2d_%2a.ppm means to get the name of
the file that contains the tile at Rank 0, File 5, you:</p>

<p>&middot; replace the %2d with the rank number, as a 2
digit decimal number: 00</p>

<p>&middot; Replace the %2a with the file number, as a 2
digit decimal number: 05</p>

<p>Note that this pattern describes file names that pamdice
produces, except that the precision may be more or less.
(pamdice uses however many digits are required for the
highest numbered image).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -across=N This is the number of tiles across in
the grid, i.e. the number of tiles in each rank, or the
number of files.</p>

<p>Default is 1.</p>

<p>-down=N This is the number of tiles up and down in the
grid, i.e. the number of tiles in each file, or the number
of ranks.</p>

<p>Default is 1.</p>

<p>-hoverlap=pixels This is the amount in pixels to overlap
the tiles horizontally. pamundice clips this much off the
right edge of every tile before joining it to the adjacent
image to the right. The tiles along the right edge remain
whole.</p>

<p>There must not be any input image narrower than
this.</p>

<p>Note that this undoes the effect of the same -hoverlap
option of pamdice.</p>

<p>Default is zero -- no overlap.</p>

<p>-voverlap=pixels This is analogous to -hoverlap, but
pamundice clips the bottom edge of each image before joining
it to the one below.</p>

<p>-verbose Print information about the processing to
Standard Error.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamundice was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).
Before that, pnmcat is the best substitute.</p>
