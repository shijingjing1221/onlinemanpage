<p>SIGALTSTACK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGALTSTACK(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigaltstack - get or set alternate signal stack
content</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigaltstack(const stack_t *ss, stack_t *oss);</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>ss points to a signalstack structure defined in
&lt;signal.h&gt; contain- ing stack content after the
call.</p>

<p>oss if not NULL, points to a signalstack structure
containing stack content before the call.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigaction(2) may indicate that a signal
should execute on an alternate stack. Where this is the
case, sigaltstack(2) stores the signal in an alternate stack
structure ss where its execution status may be examined
prior to processing.</p>

<p>The sigaltstack struct is defined in &lt;signal.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>void *ss_sp /* SVID3 uses caddr_t ss_sp int ss_flags
size_t ss_size where:</p>

<p>ss_sp points to the stack structure.</p>

<p>ss_flags specifies the stack state to SS_DISABLE or
SS_ONSTACK as fol- lows:</p>

<p>If ss is not NULL,the new state may be set to
SS_DISABLE, which specifies that the stack is to be disabled
and ss_sp and ss_size are ignored. If SS_DISABLE is not set,
the stack will be enabled.</p>

<p>If oss is not NULL, the stack state may be either
SS_ONSTACK or SS_DISABLE. The value SS_ONSTACK indicates
that the process is currently executing on the alternate
stack and that any attempt to modify it during execution
will fail. The value SS_DISABLE indicates that the current
signal stack is disabled.</p>

<p>ss_size specifies the size of the stack.</p>

<p>The value SIGSTKSZ defines the average number of bytes
used when allo- cating an alternate stack area. The value
MINSIGSTKSZ defines the min- imum stack size for a signal
handler. When processing an alternate stack size, your
program should include these values in the stack requirement
to plan for the overhead of the operating system.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES sigaltstack(2) returns 0 on success and -1
on failure.</p>

<p>ERRORS sigaltstack(2) sets errno for the following
conditions:</p>

<p>EINVAL ss is not a null pointer the ss_flags member
pointed to by ss contains flags other than SS_DISABLE.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The size of the alternate stack area is less than
MINSIGSTKSZ.</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to modify an active stack.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This function comforms to: XPG4-UNIX.</p>
