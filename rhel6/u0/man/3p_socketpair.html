<p>SOCKETPAIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SOCKETPAIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME socketpair - create a pair of connected sockets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int socketpair(int domain, int type, int protocol, int
socket_vector[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The socketpair() function shall create an
unbound pair of connected sockets in a specified domain, of
a specified type, under the protocol optionally specified by
the protocol argument. The two sockets shall be identical.
The file descriptors used in referencing the created sockets
shall be returned in socket_vector[0] and
socket_vector[1].</p>

<p>The socketpair() function takes the following
arguments:</p>

<p>domain Specifies the communications domain in which the
sockets are to be created.</p>

<p>type Specifies the type of sockets to be created.</p>

<p>protocol Specifies a particular protocol to be used with
the sockets. Specifying a protocol of 0 causes socketpair()
to use an unspec- ified default protocol appropriate for the
requested socket type.</p>

<p>socket_vector Specifies a 2-integer array to hold the
file descriptors of the created socket pair.</p>

<p>The type argument specifies the socket type, which
determines the semantics of communications over the socket.
The following socket types are defined; implementations may
specify additional socket types:</p>

<p>SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional,
connection-mode byte streams, and may provide a transmission
mechanism for out- of-band data.</p>

<p>SOCK_DGRAM Provides datagrams, which are
connectionless-mode, unreliable messages of fixed maximum
length.</p>

<p>SOCK_SEQPACKET Provides sequenced, reliable,
bidirectional, connection-mode transmission paths for
records. A record can be sent using one or more output
operations and received using one or more input operations,
but a single operation never transfers part of more than one
record. Record boundaries are visible to the receiver via
the MSG_EOR flag.</p>

<p>If the protocol argument is non-zero, it shall specify a
protocol that is supported by the address family. If the
protocol argument is zero, the default protocol for this
address family and type shall be used. The protocols
supported by the system are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The process may need to have appropriate privileges to
use the socket- pair() function or to create some
sockets.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, this function
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The socketpair() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT</p>

<p>The implementation does not support the specified
address fam- ily.</p>

<p>EMFILE No more file descriptors are available for this
process.</p>

<p>ENFILE No more file descriptors are available for the
system.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The specified protocol does not permit
creation of socket pairs.</p>

<p>EPROTONOSUPPORT</p>

<p>The protocol is not supported by the address family, or
the pro- tocol is not supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>EPROTOTYPE The socket type is not supported by the
protocol.</p>

<p>The socketpair() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The process does not have appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The documentation for specific address
families specifies which proto- cols each address family
supports. The documentation for specific pro- tocols
specifies which socket types each protocol supports.</p>

<p>The socketpair() function is used primarily with UNIX
domain sockets and need not be supported for other
domains.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
