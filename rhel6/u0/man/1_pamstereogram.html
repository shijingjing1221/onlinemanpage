<p>NAME pamstereogram - create a single-image stereogram
from a PAM height map</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamstereogram [-help] [-verbose]
[-blackandwhite | -grayscale | -color] [-maxval=value]
[-patfile=pamfile] [-xshift=pixels] [-yshift=pixels]
[-magnifypat=scale] [-guidesize=pixels] [-dpi=resolution]
[-crosseyed] [-makemask] [-eyesep=inches] [-depth=fraction]
[-randomseed=integer] [infile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamstereogram inputs a height map (a map of the
distances from your eye of the points in a scene) and
outputs a single-image stereogram (SIS). A SIS is a 2-D
image specially designed to appear three dimensional when
viewed with relaxed, slightly unfocused eyes. Whats exciting
about single-image stereograms is that they dont require
special glasses to view, although it does require a bit of
practice to train your eyes to unfocus properly. The
pamstereogram program provides a wealth of control over how
the stereogram is generated, including the following:</p>

<p>&middot; black and white, grayscale, or color output</p>

<p>&middot; single-image random-dot stereograms (SIRDS) or
single-image stereograms (SIS) using a tiled image</p>

<p>&middot; images targeting a given device resolution and
eye separation</p>

<p>&middot; optional guide boxes to assist in focusing</p>

<p>&middot; the ability to trade off depth levels for
easier viewing</p>

<p>&middot; choice of wall-eyed or cross-eyed
stereograms</p>

<p>The output is a PAM image on standard output. Options
control the exact format of the PAM. If you want a PNM (PBM,
PGM, or PPM) image, use pamtopnm on the output. There is no
need to convert if you will use the image as input to a
current Netpbm program, but many other pro- grams dont know
what a PAM is.</p>

<p>To make a red/green type of stereogram (that you view
with 3-D glasses) instead, see ppm3d.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You may use either single or double hyphens to
denote options. You may use either whitespace or an equals
sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>-verbose Display messages about image sizes and formats
and properties of the stereogram being generated.</p>

<p>-blackandwhite Produce a single-image random-dot
black-and-white stereogram. This is the default.</p>

<p>-grayscale Produce a single-image random-dot grayscale
stereogram.</p>

<p>-color Produce a single-image random-dot color
stereogram.</p>

<p>-maxval=value Designate the maximum value of each
gray/color component, i.e. the color resolution. Smaller
values make the output image have smaller numbers of unique
grays/colors. If you dont specify -maxval, pamstereogram
uses the maxval of the input image. This option has no
effect with -blackandwhite.</p>

<p>-patfile=pnmfile Specify an image to use as a repeated
background pattern for the stereogram instead of a
random-dot pattern. Intricate images generally produce a
crisper 3-D effect that simpler images. The output file will
have the same maxval and format (black and white, grayscale
or color) as the pattern file. You cannot spec- ify the
-patfile option along with -blackandwhite, -grayscale,
-color, or -maxval.</p>

<p>-xshift=pixels Shift the pattern image (designated by
-patfile) to the right by pixels pixels (default: 0). This
option is valid only along with -patfile.</p>

<p>-yshift pixels Shift the pattern image (designated by
-patfile) downwards by pixels pixels (default: 0). This
option is valid only along with -patfile.</p>

<p>-magnifypat=scale Magnify each pixel in the pattern file
or each random dot by integral scaling factor scale. Note
that pamstereogram applies the pattern magnification after
pattern shifting (-xshift and -yshift).</p>

<p>-guidesize=pixels Draw a pair of pixels by pixels black
squares on a white back- ground underneath the stereogram
proper. These squares help you guide your eyes into proper
focus to view the 3-D image. The trick is to focus your eyes
some distance behind the image, causing you to see four
black squares, then continue altering your focus distance
until the middle two black squares fuse into a single black
square. At that point, a crisp, 3-D image will appear.</p>

<p>If pixels is negative, pamstereogram will draw the guide
squares above the stereogram instead of below it. If pixels
is zero (the default), pamstereogram will draw no guide
squares.</p>

<p>-dpi=resolution Specify the resolution of the output
device in dots per inch. The default is 96 DPI, which
represents a fairly crisp screen resolution.</p>

<p>-crosseyed Invert the gray levels in the height map
(input image) so that the 3-D image pops out of the page
where it would otherwise sink into the page and vice versa.
Some people are unable to diverge their eyes and can only
cross them. The -crosseyed option enables such people to see
the 3-D image as intended.</p>

<p>-makemask Instead of a stereogram, output a PAM mask
image showing color- ing constraints. New pixels will be
taken from the pattern file where the mask is black. Copies
of existing pixels will be taken from the pattern file where
the mask is white. The -makemask option can be used to help
create more sophisticated pattern files (to use with
-patfile) Note that -makemask ignores -magni- fypat; it
always produces masks that assume a pattern magnifica- tion
of 1.</p>

<p>-eyesep=inches Specify the separation in inches between
your eyes. The default, 2.5 inches (6.4 cm), should be
sufficient for most people and probably doesnt need to be
changed.</p>

<p>-depth=fraction Specify the output images depth of
field. That is, fraction represents the fractional distance
of the near plane from the far plane. Smaller numbers make
the 3-D image easier to perceive but flatter. Larger numbers
make the 3-D image more difficult to perceive but deeper.
The default, 0.3333, generally works fairly well.</p>

<p>-randomseed=integer Specify a seed to be used for the
random number generator. The default is to use a seed based
on the time of day, to one second granularity.</p>

<p>It is useful to specify the seed if you want to create
repro- ducible results. With the same random seed, you
should get identical results every time you run
pamstereogram.</p>

<p>This is irrelevant if you use a pattern file (-patfile
option), because there is no random element to pamstereogram
s behavior.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The only parameter, infile, is the name of an
input file that is a height map image. If you dont specify
infile, the input is from stan- dard input.</p>

<p>The input is a PAM image of depth 1. Each sample
represents the dis- tance from the eye that the 3-D image at
that location should be. Higher numbers mean further from
the eye.</p>

<p>pamstereogram pays no attention the the images tuple
type and ignores all planes other than plane 0.</p>

<p>Like any Netpbm program, pamstereogram will accept PNM
input as if it were the PAM equivalent.</p>

<p>A good initial test is to input an image consisting of a
solid shape of distance 0 within a large field of maximum
distance (e.g., a black square on a white background).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generate a SIRDS out of small, brightly colored
squares and prepare it for display on an 87 DPI monitor:
pamstereogram heightmap.pam -dpi 87 -verbose -color -maxval
1 -magnifypat 3 &gt;3d.pam</p>

<p>Generate a SIS by tiling a PPM file (a prior run with
-verbose indi- cates how wide the pattern file should be for
seamless tiling, although any width is acceptable for
producing SISes): pamstereogram myheights.pam -patfile
mypattern.ppm &gt;mysis.pam</p>

<p>HISTORY pamstereogram was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April
2004), but probably broken beyond usability until Netpbm
10.32 (Februrary 2006) and Netpbm 10.26.23 (January
2006).</p>
