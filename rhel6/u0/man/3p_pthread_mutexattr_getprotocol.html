<p>PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPROTOCPOSIX)Programmer
sPTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPROTOCOL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol,
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol - get and set the protocol
attribute of the mutex attributes object (REALTIME
THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol(const
pthread_mutexattr_t * restrict attr, int *restrict
protocol); int
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr, int
protocol);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() functions, respectively,
shall get and set the protocol attribute of a mutex
attributes object pointed to by attr which was previously
created by the function pthread_mutexattr_init().</p>

<p>The protocol attribute defines the protocol to be
followed in utilizing mutexes. The value of protocol may be
one of:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE</p>

<p>PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT</p>

<p>PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT</p>

<p>which are defined in the &lt;pthread.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
protocol attribute, its priority and scheduling shall not be
affected by its mutex ownership.</p>

<p>When a thread is blocking higher priority threads
because of owning one or more mutexes with the
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT protocol attribute, it shall execute at
the higher of its priority or the priority of the highest
priority thread waiting on any of the mutexes owned by this
thread and initialized with this protocol.</p>

<p>When a thread owns one or more mutexes initialized with
the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the
higher of its priority or the highest of the priority
ceilings of all the mutexes owned by this thread and
initialized with this attribute, regardless of whether other
threads are blocked on any of these mutexes or not.</p>

<p>While a thread is holding a mutex which has been
initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or
PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be
subject to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue
at its priority in the event that its original priority is
changed, such as by a call to sched_setparam(). Likewise,
when a thread unlocks a mutex that has been initialized with
the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol
attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the
tail of the scheduling queue at its priority in the event
that its original priority is changed.</p>

<p>If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes
initialized with dif- ferent protocols, it shall execute at
the highest of the priorities that it would have obtained by
each of these protocols.</p>

<p>When a thread makes a call to pthread_mutex_lock(), the
mutex was ini- tialized with the protocol attribute having
the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, when the calling thread is
blocked because the mutex is owned by another thread, that
owner thread shall inherit the priority level of the calling
thread as long as it continues to own the mutex. The
implementation shall update its execution priority to the
maximum of its assigned priority and all its inherited
priorities. Fur- thermore, if this owner thread itself
becomes blocked on another mutex, the same priority
inheritance effect shall be propagated to this other owner
thread, in a recursive manner.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() function
shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOTSUP The value specified by protocol is an
unsupported value.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol() and
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr or protocol is
invalid.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the privilege to perform
the operation.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
