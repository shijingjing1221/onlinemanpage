<p>XClearArea(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XClearArea(3)</p>

<p>NAME XClearArea, XClearWindow - clear area or window</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XClearArea(Display *display, Window w, int x,
int y, unsigned width, unsigned height, Bool exposures);</p>

<p>int XClearWindow(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>exposures Specifies a Boolean value that indicates if
Expose events are to be generated.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height, which are the
dimensions of the rectangle.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
to the origin of the window and specify the upper-left
corner of the rectangle.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XClearArea function paints a rectangular
area in the specified win- dow according to the specified
dimensions with the windows background pixel or pixmap. The
subwindow-mode effectively is ClipByChildren. If width is
zero, it is replaced with the current width of the window
minus x. If height is zero, it is replaced with the current
height of the window minus y. If the window has a defined
background tile, the rectangle clipped by any children is
filled with this tile. If the window has background None,
the contents of the window are not changed. In either case,
if exposures is True, one or more Expose events are
generated for regions of the rectangle that are either
visible or are being retained in a backing store. If you
specify a window whose class is InputOnly, a BadMatch error
results.</p>

<p>XClearArea can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XClearWindow function clears the entire area in the
specified win- dow and is equivalent to XClearArea (display,
w, 0, 0, 0, 0, False). If the window has a defined
background tile, the rectangle is tiled with a plane-mask of
all ones and GXcopy function. If the window has background
None, the contents of the window are not changed. If you
specify a window whose class is InputOnly, a BadMatch error
results.</p>

<p>XClearWindow can generate BadMatch and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a
Drawable.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
