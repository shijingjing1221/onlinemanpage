<p>DOCBOOK2MAN-SPEC.PL(1) DOCBOOK2MAN-SPEC.PL(1)</p>

<p>NAME docbook2man-spec.pl - convert DocBook RefEntries to
man pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgmlspl docbook2man-spec.pl</p>

<p>nsgmls [ sgml document ]| sgmlspl
docbook2man-spec.pl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION docbook2man is a sgmlspl spec file that
produced man pages (using the -man macros) from DocBook
RefEntry markup.</p>

<p>The program reads ESIS produced by nsgmls (or other SGML
parsers) from standard input. Markup not found in RefEntry
is discarded.</p>

<p>Its output, the converted man pages, are written to the
current direc- tory. If RefMeta information is not specified
in a RefEntry, then the man page will be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>The file manpage.links will also be created, which
contains any aliases of the manpages generated. This file is
in the format:</p>

<p>&lt;man page&gt; &lt;alias manpage&gt;</p>

<p>The manpage.refs file keeps track of XRef references.
Note that if the input document has any forward references,
then docbook2man may have to be invoked twice (the first
time updating manpage.refs) to resolve them.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS The SGMLSpm package from CPAN. This package
includes the sgmlspl script that is also needed.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Trying docbook2man on non-DocBook or
non-conformant SGML results in undefined behavior. :-)</p>

<p>This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.</p>

<p>This program does not come close to supporting all the
possible markup in DocBook, and may produce wrong output in
some cases with supported markup.</p>

<p>TO DO Obvious stuff:</p>

<p>&middot; Fix docbook2man breakages found in the test
documents, especially weird.sgml.</p>

<p>&middot; Add new element handling and fix existing
handling. Be robust.</p>

<p>&middot; Produce cleanest, readable man output as
possible (unlike some other converters). Follow Linux man(7)
convention. As conversion to man pages is usually not done
very often, it is better to be slower/more complicated than
to produce wrong output. Also if someone wants to give up
using DocBook for whatever reason, the last-converted man
pages can then be maintained manually.</p>

<p>&middot; Make it faster. I think most of the speed
problems so far is with parsing ESIS. Rewrite SGMLS.pm with
C and/or get input directly from SP.</p>

<p>&middot; Support other (human) languages. But what to do
with non-ASCII charsets? SGMLSpm doesnt report them and roff
does not grok them. [Comment: text after enclosed lists (and
SS blocks) will break doc- book2man] If we do this, more
people can use DocBook.</p>
