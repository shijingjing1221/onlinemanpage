<p>PERL587DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL587DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl587delta - what is new for perl v5.8.7</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.8.6 release and the 5.8.7 release.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes There are no changes incompatible
with 5.8.6.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Unicode Character Database 4.1.0 The
copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8
has been updated to 4.1.0 from 4.0.1. See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges&gt;
for the notable changes.</p>

<p>suidperl less insecure A pair of exploits in
&quot;suidperl&quot; involving debugging code have been
closed.</p>

<p>For new projects the core perl team strongly recommends
that you use dedicated, single purpose security tools such
as &quot;sudo&quot; in preference to
&quot;suidperl&quot;.</p>

<p>Optional site customization script The perl interpreter
can be built to allow the use of a site customization
script. By default this is not enabled, to be consistent
with previous perl releases. To use this, add
&quot;-Dusesitecustomize&quot; to the command line flags
when running the &quot;Configure&quot; script. See also
&quot;-f&quot; in perlrun.</p>

<p>&quot;Config.pm&quot; is now much smaller.
&quot;Config.pm&quot; is now about 3K rather than 32K, with
the infrequently used code and %Config values loaded on
demand. This is transparent to the programmer, but means
that most code will save parsing and loading 29K of script
(for example, code that uses &quot;File::Find&quot;).</p>

<p>&middot; utf8 upgraded to version 1.05</p>

<p>&middot; Win32 upgraded to version 0.24, which provides
Win32::GetFileVersion</p>

<p>Utility Changes find2perl enhancements
&quot;find2perl&quot; has new options &quot;-iname&quot;,
&quot;-path&quot; and &quot;-ipath&quot;.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements The internal pointer mapping
hash used during ithreads cloning now uses an arena for
memory allocation. In tests this reduced ithreads cloning
time by about 10%.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements &middot; The
Win32 &quot;dmake&quot; makefile.mk has been updated to make
it compatible with the latest versions of dmake.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;PERL_MALLOC&quot;,
&quot;DEBUG_MSTATS&quot;,
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT&quot; and
&quot;NO_HASH_SEED&quot; should now work in Win32
makefiles.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &middot; The socket() function on
Win32 has been fixed so that it is able to use transport
providers which specify a protocol of 0 (meaning any
protocol is allowed) once more. (This was broken in 5.8.6,
and typically caused the use of ICMP sockets to fail.)</p>

<p>&middot; Another obscure bug involving
&quot;substr&quot; and UTF-8 caused by bad internal offset
caching has been identified and fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; A bug involving the loading of UTF-8 tables by
the regexp engine has been fixed - code such as
&quot;&quot;&quot; =~ /[[:print:]]/&quot; will no longer
give corrupt results.</p>

<p>&middot; Case conversion operations such as
&quot;uc&quot; on a long Unicode string could exhaust
memory. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;index&quot;/&quot;rindex&quot; were buggy
for some combinations of Unicode and non-Unicode data. This
has been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;read&quot; (and presumably
&quot;sysread&quot;) would expose the UTF-8 internals when
reading from a byte oriented file handle into a UTF-8
scalar. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Several &quot;pack&quot;/&quot;unpack&quot; bug
fixes:</p>

<p>&middot; Checksums with &quot;b&quot; or &quot;B&quot;
formats were broken.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;unpack&quot; checksums could overflow
with the &quot;C&quot; format.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;U0&quot; and &quot;C0&quot; are now
scoped to &quot;()&quot; &quot;pack&quot; sub-templates.</p>

<p>&middot; Counted length prefixes now dont change
&quot;C0&quot;/&quot;U0&quot; mode.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;pack&quot; &quot;Z0&quot; used to destroy
the preceding character.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;P&quot;/&quot;p&quot; &quot;pack&quot;
formats used to only recognise literal &quot;undef&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Using closures with ithreads could cause perl
to crash. This was due to failure to correctly lock internal
OP structures, and has been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; The return value of &quot;close&quot; now
correctly reflects any file errors that occur while flushing
the handles data, instead of just giving failure if the
actual underlying file close operation failed.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;not() || 1&quot; used to segfault.
&quot;not()&quot; now behaves like not(0), which was the pre
5.6.0 behaviour.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;h2ph&quot; has various enhancements to
cope with constructs in header files that used to result in
incorrect or invalid output.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics There is a new taint error,
&quot;%ENV is aliased to %s&quot;. This error is thrown when
taint checks are enabled and when *ENV has been aliased, so
that %ENV has no env-magic anymore and hence the environment
cannot be verified as taint-free.</p>

<p>The internals of &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;
have been updated. All legitimate templates should work as
before, but there may be some changes in the error reported
for complex failure cases. Any behaviour changes for
non-error cases are bugs, and should be reported.</p>

<p>Changed Internals There has been a fair amount of
refactoring of the &quot;C&quot; source code, partly to make
it tidier and more maintainable. The resulting object code
and the &quot;perl&quot; binary may well be smaller than
5.8.6, and hopefully faster in some cases, but apart from
this there should be no user-detectable changes.</p>

<p>&quot;${^UTF8LOCALE}&quot; has been added to give perl
space access to &quot;PL_utf8locale&quot;.</p>

<p>The size of the arenas used to allocate SV heads and
most SV bodies can now be changed at compile time. The old
size was 1008 bytes, the new default size is 4080 bytes.</p>

<p>Known Problems Unicode strings returned from overloaded
operators can be buggy. This is a long standing bug reported
since 5.8.6 was released, but we do not yet have a suitable
fix for it.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems On UNICOS,
lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc.t hangs burning CPU.
ext/B/t/bytecode.t and ext/Socket/t/socketpair.t both fail
tests. These are unlikely to be resolved, as our valiant
UNICOS porters last Cray is being decommissioned.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
