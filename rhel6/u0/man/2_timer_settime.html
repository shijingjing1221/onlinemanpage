<p>TIMER_SETTIME(2) Linux Programmer s Guide
TIMER_SETTIME(2)</p>

<p>NAME timer_settime - Set the time on a POSIX.1b interval
timer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS long sys_timer_settime (timer_t timer_id, int
flags, const struct itimerspec *new_setting, struct
itimerspec *old_setting);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION time_settime arms the time and sets the time
if the new_setting struct member it_value is non-zero, until
the next expiration of the timer specified by timer_id. If
the timer was already armed when timer_set- time was called,
the call resets the time until the next expiration to
new_setting. If the it_value of new_setting is zero, then
the timer is disarmed. If old_setting is non-NULL, the
function stores the previous amount of time before the timer
would have expired, or zero if the timer was disarmed along
withthe previous timer reload value in this argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE timer_settime returns 0 on success.
Otherwise, timer_settime returns the errors listed in the
&quot;Errors&quot; section.</p>

<p>ERRORS -EINVAL An invalid timer_id value was
specified.</p>

<p>-EFAULT The new_setting valid is invalid.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO timer_create(2), timer_delete(2),
timer_getovverun(2), timer_get- time(2).</p>
