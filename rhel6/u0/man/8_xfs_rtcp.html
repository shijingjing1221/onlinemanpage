<p>NAME xfs_rtcp - XFS realtime copy command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_rtcp [ -e extsize ] [ -p ] source ...
target</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_rtcp copies a file to the realtime
partition on an XFS filesystem. If there is more than one
source and target, the final argument (the target) must be a
directory which already exists.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e extsize Sets the extent size of the
destination realtime file.</p>

<p>-p Use if the size of the source file is not an even
multiple of the block size of the destination filesystem.
When -p is speci- fied xfs_rtcp will pad the destination
file to a size which is an even multiple of the filesystem
block size. This is neces- sary since the realtime file is
created using direct I/O and the minimum I/O is the
filesystem block size.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO xfs(5), mkfs.xfs(8), mount(8).</p>

<p>CAVEATS Currently, realtime partitions are not supported
under the Linux ver- sion of XFS, and use of a realtime
partition WILL CAUSE CORRUPTION on the data partition. As
such, this command is made available for curious DEVELOPERS
ONLY at this point in time.</p>
