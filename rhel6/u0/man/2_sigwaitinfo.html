<p>SIGWAITINFO(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGWAITINFO(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigwaitinfo, sigtimedwait - synchronously wait for
queued signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t
*info);</p>

<p>int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info,
const struct timespec *timeout);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>sigwaitinfo(), sigtimedwait(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;=
199309L</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigwaitinfo() suspends execution of the
calling thread until one of the signals in set is delivered.
(If one of the signals in set is already pending for the
calling thread, sigwaitinfo() will return immediately with
information about that signal.)</p>

<p>sigwaitinfo() removes the delivered signal from the set
of pending sig- nals and returns the signal number as its
function result. If the info argument is not NULL, then it
returns a structure of type siginfo_t (see sigaction(2))
containing information about the signal.</p>

<p>Signals returned via sigwaitinfo() are delivered in the
usual order; see signal(7) for further details.</p>

<p>sigtimedwait() operates in exactly the same way as
sigwaitinfo() except that it has an additional argument,
timeout, which enables an upper bound to be placed on the
time for which the thread is suspended. This argument is of
the following type:</p>

<p>struct timespec { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ }</p>

<p>If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a
poll is per- formed: sigtimedwait() returns immediately,
either with information about a signal that was pending for
the caller, or with an error if none of the signals in set
was pending.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, both sigwaitinfo() and
sigtimedwait() return a signal num- ber (i.e., a value
greater than zero). On failure both calls return -1, with
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN No signal in set was delivered within the
timeout period speci- fied to sigtimedwait().</p>

<p>EINTR The wait was interrupted by a signal handler; see
signal(7). (This handler was for a signal other than one of
those in set.)</p>

<p>EINVAL timeout was invalid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES In normal usage, the calling program blocks the
signals in set via a prior call to sigprocmask(2) (so that
the default disposition for these signals does not occur if
they are delivered between successive calls to sigwaitinfo()
or sigtimedwait()) and does not establish handlers for these
signals. In a multithreaded program, the signal should be
blocked in all threads to prevent the signal being delivered
to a thread other than the one calling sigwaitinfo() or
sigtimedwait()).</p>

<p>The set of signals that is pending for a given thread is
the union of the set of signals that is pending specifically
for that thread and the set of signals that is pending for
the process as a whole (see sig- nal(7)).</p>

<p>If multiple threads of a process are blocked waiting for
the same sig- nal(s) in sigwaitinfo() or sigtimedwait(),
then exactly one of the threads will actually receive the
signal if it is delivered to the pro- cess as a whole; which
of the threads receives the signal is indetermi- nate.</p>

<p>POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the timeout
argument of sigtimedwait() unspecified, permitting the
possibility that this has the same meaning as a call to
sigwaitinfo(), and indeed this is what is done on Linux.</p>

<p>On Linux, sigwaitinfo() is a library function
implemented on top of sigtimedwait().</p>
