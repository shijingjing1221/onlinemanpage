<p>DIALOG(1) DIALOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME dialog - display dialog boxes from shell
scripts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dialog --clear dialog --create-rc file dialog
--print-maxsize dialog common-options box-options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dialog is a program that will let you to
present a variety of questions or display messages using
dialog boxes from a shell script. These types of dialog
boxes are implemented (though not all are necessarily
compiled into dialog):</p>

<p>calendar, checklist, dselect, editbox, form, fselect,
gauge, infobox, inputbox, inputmenu, menu, mixedform,
mixedgauge, msgbox (message), passwordbox, passwordform,
pause, progressbox, radiolist, tailbox, tailboxbg, textbox,
timebox, and yesno (yes/no).</p>

<p>You can put more than one dialog box into a script:</p>

<p>- Use the &quot;--and-widget&quot; token to force Dialog
to proceed to the next dialog unless you have pressed ESC to
cancel, or</p>

<p>- Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making
a chain. Dialog stops chaining when the return code from a
dialog is nonze- ro, e.g., Cancel or No (see
DIAGNOSTICS).</p>

<p>Some widgets, e.g., checklist, will write text to
dialogs output. Normally that is the standard error, but
there are options for changing this:
&quot;--output-fd&quot;, &quot;--stderr&quot; and
&quot;--stdout&quot;. No text is written if the Cancel
button (or ESC) is pressed; dialog exits immediately in that
case.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options begin with &quot;--&quot; (two ASCII
hyphens, for the benefit of those using systems with
deranged locale support).</p>

<p>A &quot;--&quot; by itself is used as an escape, i.e.,
the next token on the com- mand-line is not treated as an
option. dialog --title -- --Not an option</p>

<p>The &quot;--args&quot; option tells dialog to list the
command-line parameters to the standard error. This is
useful when debugging complex scripts us- ing the
&quot;--&quot; and &quot;--file&quot;, since the
command-line may be rewritten as these are expanded.</p>

<p>The &quot;--file&quot; option tells dialog to read
parameters from the file named as its value. dialog --file
parameterfile Blanks not within double-quotes are discarded
(use backslashes to quote single characters). The result is
inserted into the command-line, re- placing
&quot;--file&quot; and its option value. Interpretation of
the command- line resumes from that point. If parameterfile
begins with &quot;&amp;&quot;, dialog interprets the
following text as a file descriptor number rather than a
filename.</p>

<p>Common Options --ascii-lines Rather than draw graphics
lines around boxes, draw ASCII &quot;+&quot; and
&quot;-&quot; in the same place. See also
&quot;--no-lines&quot;.</p>

<p>--aspect ratio This gives you some control over the box
dimensions when using auto sizing (specifying 0 for height
and width). It represents width / height. The default is 9,
which means 9 characters wide to every 1 line high.</p>

<p>--backtitle backtitle Specifies a backtitle string to be
displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>--begin y x Specify the position of the upper left
corner of a dialog box on the screen.</p>

<p>--cancel-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--clear Clears the widget screen, keeping only the
screen_color back- ground. Use this when you combine widgets
with &quot;--and-widget&quot; to erase the contents of a
previous widget on the screen, so it won t be seen under the
contents of a following widget. Under- stand this as the
complement of &quot;--keep-window&quot;. To compare the
effects, use these:</p>

<p>All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered
1,2,3: dialog --begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0
--and-widget --begin 4 4 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0
--and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>Only the last widget is left visible: dialog --clear
--begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear
--begin 4 4 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6
6 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered
3,2,1: dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot;
0 0 --and-widget --keep-window --begin 4 4 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>First and third widget visible, staircase effect,
ordered 3,1: dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear --begin 4 4 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>Note, if you want to restore original console colors and
send your cursor home after the dialog program has exited,
use the clear (1) command.</p>

<p>--colors Interpret embedded &quot; sequences in the
dialogcharacter,text by the following which tells dialog to
set colors or video at- tributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI
used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan and white respectively. Bold is set by b, reset by B.
Reverse is set by r, reset by R. Underline is set by u ,
reset by U . The settings are cumulative, e.g., &quot;&quot;
makes thered.followingRestore textnormalbold (perhapright)
settings with &quot;&quot;. --column-separator string Tell
dialog to split data for radio/checkboxes and menus on the
occurrences of the given string, and to align the split data
in- to columns.</p>

<p>--cr-wrap Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text
as a newline on the screen. Otherwise, dialog will only wrap
lines where needed to fit inside the text box. Even though
you can control line breaks with this, dialog will still
wrap any lines that are too long for the width of the box.
Without cr-wrap, the layout of your text may be formatted to
look nice in the source code of your script without
affecting the way it will look in the dia- log.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;--no-collapse&quot; and
&quot;--trim&quot; options.</p>

<p>--create-rc file When dialog supports run-time
configuration, this can be used to dump a sample
configuration file to the file specified by file.</p>

<p>--defaultno Make the default value of the yes/no box a
No. Likewise, make the default button of widgets that
provide &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; a Cancel. If
&quot;--nocancel&quot; or &quot;--visit-items&quot; are
given those op- tions overrides this, making the default
button always &quot;Yes&quot; (internally the same as
&quot;OK&quot;).</p>

<p>--default-item string Set the default item in a
checklist, form or menu box. Normally the first item in the
box is the default.</p>

<p>--exit-label string Override the label used for
&quot;EXIT&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--extra-button Show an extra button, between
&quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--extra-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Extra&quot; buttons. Note: for input- menu widgets,
this defaults to &quot;Rename&quot;.</p>

<p>--help Prints the help message to dialogs output. The
help message is printed if no options are given.</p>

<p>--help-button Show a help-button after &quot;OK&quot;
and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons, i.e., in checklist,
radiolist and menu boxes. If &quot;--item-help&quot; is also
given, on exit the return status will be the same as for the
&quot;OK&quot; button, and the item-help text will be
written to dialogs output after the token &quot;HELP&quot;.
Otherwise, the return status will indicate that the Help
button was pressed, and no message printed.</p>

<p>--help-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Help&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--help-status If the help-button is selected, writes the
checklist, radiolist or form information after the item-help
&quot;HELP&quot; information. This can be used to
reconstruct the state of a checklist after processing the
help request.</p>

<p>--ignore Ignore options that dialog does not recognize.
Some well-known ones such as &quot;--icon&quot; are ignored
anyway, but this is a better choice for compatibility with
other implementations.</p>

<p>--input-fd fd Read keyboard input from the given file
descriptor. Most dialog scripts read from the standard
input, but the gauge widget reads a pipe (which is always
standard input). Some configurations do not work properly
when dialog tries to reopen the terminal. Use this option
(with appropriate juggling of file-descriptors) if your
script must work in that type of environment.</p>

<p>--insecure Makes the password widget friendlier but less
secure, by echoing asterisks for each character.</p>

<p>--item-help Interpret the tags data for checklist,
radiolist and menu boxes adding a column which is displayed
in the bottom line of the screen, for the currently selected
item.</p>

<p>--keep-tite Normally dialog checks to see if it is
running in an xterm, and in that case tries to suppress the
initialization strings that would make it switch to the
alternate screen. Switching between the normal and alternate
screens is visually distracting in a script which runs
dialog several times. Use this option to al- low dialog to
use those initialization strings.</p>

<p>--keep-window Normally when dialog performs several
tailboxbg widgets connect- ed by &quot;--and-widget&quot;,
it clears the old widget from the screen by painting over
it. Use this option to suppress that repaint- ing.</p>

<p>At exit, dialog repaints all of the widgets which have
been marked with &quot;--keep-window&quot;, even if they are
not tailboxbg wid- gets. That causes them to be repainted in
reverse order. See the discussion of the &quot;--clear&quot;
option for examples.</p>

<p>--max-input size Limit input strings to the given size.
If not specified, the limit is 2048.</p>

<p>--no-cancel</p>

<p>--nocancel Suppress the &quot;Cancel&quot; button in
checklist, inputbox and menu box modes. A script can still
test if the user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.</p>

<p>--no-collapse Normally dialog converts tabs to spaces
and reduces multiple spaces to a single space for text which
is displayed in a mes- sage boxes, etc. Use this option to
disable that feature. Note that dialog will still wrap text,
subject to the &quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and &quot;--trim&quot;
options.</p>

<p>--no-kill Tells dialog to put the tailboxbg box in the
background, print- ing its process id to dialogs output.
SIGHUP is disabled for the background process.</p>

<p>--no-label string Override the label used for
&quot;No&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--no-lines Rather than draw lines around boxes, draw
spaces in the same place. See also
&quot;--ascii-lines&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-ok</p>

<p>--nook Suppress the &quot;OK&quot; button in checklist,
inputbox and menu box modes. A script can still test if the
user pressed the &quot;Enter&quot; key to accept the
data.</p>

<p>--no-shadow Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the
right and bottom of each dialog box.</p>

<p>--ok-label string Override the label used for
&quot;OK&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--output-fd fd Direct output to the given file
descriptor. Most dialog scripts write to the standard error,
but error messages may also be written there, depending on
your script.</p>

<p>--separator string</p>

<p>--output-separatorstring Specify a string that will
separate the output on dialogs out- put from checklists,
rather than a newline (for --separate-out- put) or a space.
This applies to other widgets such as forms and editboxes
which normally use a newline.</p>

<p>--print-maxsize Print the maximum size of dialog boxes,
i.e., the screen size, to dialogs output. This may be used
alone, without other op- tions.</p>

<p>--print-size Prints the size of each dialog box to
dialogs output.</p>

<p>--print-version Prints dialogs version to dialog s
output. This may be used alone, without other options.</p>

<p>--separate-output For checklist widgets, output result
one line at a time, with no quoting. This facilitates
parsing by another program.</p>

<p>--separate-widget string Specify a string that will
separate the output on dialogs out- put from each widget.
This is used to simplify parsing the re- sult of a dialog
with several widgets. If this option is not given, the
default separator string is a tab character.</p>

<p>--shadow Draw a shadow to the right and bottom of each
dialog box.</p>

<p>--single-quoted Use single-quoting as needed (and no
quotes if unneeded) for the output of checklist s as well as
the item-help text. If this option is not set, dialog uses
double quotes around each item. That requires occasional use
of backslashes to make the output useful in shell
scripts.</p>

<p>--size-err Check the resulting size of a dialog box
before trying to use it, printing the resulting size if it
is larger than the screen. (This option is obsolete, since
all new-window calls are checked).</p>

<p>--sleep secs Sleep (delay) for the given number of
seconds after processing a dialog box.</p>

<p>--stderr Direct output to the standard error. This is
the default, since curses normally writes screen updates to
the standard output.</p>

<p>--stdout Direct output to the standard output. This
option is provided for compatibility with Xdialog, however
using it in portable scripts is not recommended, since
curses normally writes its screen updates to the standard
output. If you use this option, dialog attempts to reopen
the terminal so it can write to the display. Depending on
the platform and your environment, that may fail.</p>

<p>--tab-correct Convert each tab character to one or more
spaces (for the textbox widget; otherwise to a single
space). Otherwise, tabs are rendered according to the curses
library s interpretation.</p>

<p>--tab-len n Specify the number of spaces that a tab
character occupies if the &quot;--tab-correct&quot; option
is given. The default is 8. This option is only effective
for the textbox widget.</p>

<p>--timeout secs Timeout (exit with error code) if no user
response within the given number of seconds. This is
overridden if the background &quot;--tailboxbg is used. A
timeout of zero seconds is ignored.</p>

<p>--title title Specifies a title string to be displayed
at the top of the dia- log box.</p>

<p>--trace filename logs keystrokes to the given file. Use
control/T to log a pic- ture of the current dialog
window.</p>

<p>--trim eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines
and repeated blanks from message text.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and
&quot;--no-collapse&quot; options.</p>

<p>--version Same as &quot;--print-version&quot;.</p>

<p>--visit-items Modify the tab-traversal of checklist,
radiobox, menubox and in- putmenu to include the list of
items as one of the states. This is useful as a visual aid,
i.e., the cursor position helps some users.</p>

<p>When this option is given, the cursor is initially
placed on the list. Abbreviations (the first letter of the
tag) apply to the list items. If you tab to the button row,
abbreviations apply to the buttons.</p>

<p>--yes-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Yes&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>Box Options All dialog boxes have at least three
parameters:</p>

<p>text the caption or contents of the box.</p>

<p>height the height of the dialog box.</p>

<p>width the width of the dialog box.</p>

<p>Other parameters depend on the box type.</p>

<p>--calendar text height width day month year A calendar
box displays month, day and year in separately ad- justable
windows. If the values for day, month or year are missing or
negative, the current date s corresponding values are used.
You can increment or decrement any of those using the left-,
up-, right- and down-arrows. Use vi-style h, j, k and l for
moving around the array of days in a month. Use tab or
backtab to move between windows. If the year is given as
zero, the current date is used as an initial value.</p>

<p>On exit, the date is printed in the form
day/month/year.</p>

<p>--checklist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A checklist box is similar to a menu box; there
are multiple en- tries presented in the form of a menu.
Instead of choosing one entry among the entries, each entry
can be turned on or off by the user. The initial on/off
state of each entry is specified by status.</p>

<p>On exit, a list of the tag strings of those entries that
are turned on will be printed on dialogs output. If the
&quot;--sepa- rate-output&quot; option is not given, the
strings will be quoted to make it simple for scripts to
separate them. See the &quot;--single- quoted&quot; option,
which modifies the quoting behavior.</p>

<p>--dselect filepath height width The directory-selection
dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a
directory, and above that a windows with directory
names.</p>

<p>Here filepath can be a filepath in which case the
directory win- dow will display the contents of the path and
the text-entry window will contain the preselected
directory.</p>

<p>Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.
Within the directory window, use the up/down arrow keys to
scroll the cur- rent selection. Use the space-bar to copy
the current selection into the text-entry window.</p>

<p>Typing any printable characters switches focus to the
text-entry window, entering that character as well as
scrolling the direc- tory window to the closest match.</p>

<p>Use a carriage return or the &quot;OK&quot; button to
accept the current value in the text-entry window and
exit.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are
written to dialogs output.</p>

<p>--editbox filepath height width The edit-box dialog
displays a copy of the file. You may edit it using the
backspace, delete and cursor keys to correct typing errors.
It also recognizes pageup/pagedown. Unlike the --in- putbox,
you must tab to the &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;
buttons to close the dialog. Pressing the &quot;Enter&quot;
key within the box will split the corresponding line.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the edit window are written to
dialogs output.</p>

<p>--form text height width formheight [ label y x item y x
flen ilen ] ... The form dialog displays a form consisting
of labels and fields, which are positioned on a scrollable
window by coordinates given in the script. The field length
flen and input-length ilen tell how long the field can be.
The former defines the length shown for a selected field,
while the latter defines the permissible length of the data
entered in the field.</p>

<p>- If flen is zero, the corresponding field cannot be
altered. and the contents of the field determine the
displayed-length.</p>

<p>- If flen is negative, the corresponding field cannot be
al- tered, and the negated value of flen is used as the dis-
played-length.</p>

<p>- If ilen is zero, it is set to flen.</p>

<p>Use up/down arrows (or control/N, control/P) to move
between fields. Use tab to move between windows.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the form-fields are written to
dialogs output, each field separated by a newline. The text
used to fill non-editable fields (flen is zero or negative)
is not writ- ten out.</p>

<p>--fselect filepath height width The fselect
(file-selection) dialog displays a text-entry window in
which you can type a filename (or directory), and above that
two windows with directory names and filenames.</p>

<p>Here filepath can be a filepath in which case the file
and di- rectory windows will display the contents of the
path and the text-entry window will contain the preselected
filename.</p>

<p>Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.
Within the directory or filename windows, use the up/down
arrow keys to scroll the current selection. Use the
space-bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry
window.</p>

<p>Typing any printable characters switches focus to the
text-entry window, entering that character as well as
scrolling the direc- tory and filename windows to the
closest match.</p>

<p>Typing the space character forces dialog to complete the
current name (up to the point where there may be a match
against more than one entry).</p>

<p>Use a carriage return or the &quot;OK&quot; button to
accept the current value in the text-entry window and
exit.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are
written to dialogs output.</p>

<p>--gauge text height width [percent] A gauge box displays
a meter along the bottom of the box. The meter indicates the
percentage. New percentages are read from standard input,
one integer per line. The meter is updated to reflect each
new percentage. If the standard input reads the string
&quot;XXX&quot;, then the first line following is taken as
an inte- ger percentage, then subsequent lines up to another
&quot;XXX&quot; are used for a new prompt. The gauge exits
when EOF is reached on the standard input.</p>

<p>The percent value denotes the initial percentage shown
in the meter. If not specified, it is zero.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. The
widget ac- cepts no input, so the exit status is always
OK.</p>

<p>--infobox text height width An info box is basically a
message box. However, in this case, dialog will exit
immediately after displaying the message to the user. The
screen is not cleared when dialog exits, so that the message
will remain on the screen until the calling shell script
clears it later. This is useful when you want to inform the
us- er that some operations are carrying on that may require
some time to finish.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialog s output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be re- turned.</p>

<p>--inputbox text height width [init] An input box is
useful when you want to ask questions that re- quire the
user to input a string as the answer. If init is sup- plied
it is used to initialize the input string. When entering the
string, the backspace, delete and cursor keys can be used to
correct typing errors. If the input string is longer than
can fit in the dialog box, the input field will be
scrolled.</p>

<p>On exit, the input string will be printed on dialog s
output.</p>

<p>--inputmenu text height width menu-height [ tag item ]
... An inputmenu box is very similar to an ordinary menu
box. There are only a few differences between them:</p>

<p>1. The entries are not automatically centered but left
adjust- ed.</p>

<p>2. An extra button (called Rename) is implied to rename
the current item when it is pressed.</p>

<p>3. It is possible to rename the current entry by
pressing the Rename button. Then dialog will write the
following on dia- logs output.</p>

<p>RENAMED &lt;tag&gt; &lt;item&gt;</p>

<p>--menu text height width menu-height [ tag item ] ... As
its name suggests, a menu box is a dialog box that can be
used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for
the user to choose. Choices are displayed in the order
given. Each menu entry consists of a tag string and an item
string. The tag gives the entry a name to distinguish it
from the other entries in the menu. The item is a short
description of the option that the entry represents. The
user can move between the menu en- tries by pressing the
cursor keys, the first letter of the tag as a hot-key, or
the number keys 1-9. There are menu-height en- tries
displayed in the menu at one time, but the menu will be
scrolled if there are more entries than that.</p>

<p>On exit the tag of the chosen menu entry will be printed
on dia- logs output. If the &quot;--help-button&quot; option
is given, the cor- responding help text will be printed if
the user selects the help button.</p>

<p>--mixedform text height width formheight [ label y x
item y x flen ilen itype ] ... The mixedform dialog displays
a form consisting of labels and fields, much like the --form
dialog. It differs by adding a field-type parameter to each
fields description. Each bit in the type denotes an
attribute of the field:</p>

<p>1 hidden, e.g., a password field.</p>

<p>2 readonly, e.g., a label.</p>

<p>--mixedgauge text height width percent [ tag1 item1 ]
... A mixedgauge box displays a meter along the bottom of
the box. The meter indicates the percentage.</p>

<p>It also displays a list of the tag- and item-values at
the top of the box. See dialog(3) for the tag values.</p>

<p>The text is shown as a caption between the list and
meter. The percent value denotes the initial percentage
shown in the meter.</p>

<p>No provision is made for reading data from the standard
input as --gauge does.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialog s output. The
widget ac- cepts no input, so the exit status is always
OK.</p>

<p>--msgbox text height width A message box is very similar
to a yes/no box. The only differ- ence between a message box
and a yes/no box is that a message box has only a single OK
button. You can use this dialog box to display any message
you like. After reading the message, the user can press the
ENTER key so that dialog will exit and the calling shell
script can continue its operation.</p>

<p>If the message is too large for the space, dialog may
allow you to scroll it, provided that the underlying curses
implementation is capable enough. In this case, a percentage
is shown in the base of the widget.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be re- turned.</p>

<p>--pause text height width seconds A pause box displays a
meter along the bottom of the box. The meter indicates how
many seconds remain until the end of the pause. The pause
exits when timeout is reached or the user presses the OK
button (status OK) or the user presses the CANCEL button or
Esc key.</p>

<p>--passwordbox text height width [init] A password box is
similar to an input box, except that the text the user
enters is not displayed. This is useful when prompting for
passwords or other sensitive information. Be aware that if
anything is passed in &quot;init&quot;, it will be visible
in the systems process table to casual snoopers. Also, it is
very confusing to the user to provide them with a default
password they cannot see. For these reasons, using
&quot;init&quot; is highly discouraged. See
&quot;--insecure&quot; if you do not care about your
password.</p>

<p>On exit, the input string will be printed on dialog s
output.</p>

<p>--passwordform text height width formheight [ label y x
item y x flen ilen ] ... This is identical to --form except
that all text fields are treated as password widgets rather
than inputbox widgets.</p>

<p>--progressbox text height width</p>

<p>--progressbox height width A progressbox is similar to
an tailbox, except that it will exit when it reaches the end
of the file. If three parameters are given, it displays the
text under the title, delineated from the scrolling file s
contents. If only two parameters are given, this text is
omitted.</p>

<p>--radiolist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A radiolist box is similar to a menu box. The
only difference is that you can indicate which entry is
currently selected, by setting its status to on.</p>

<p>On exit, the name of the selected item is written to
dialogs output.</p>

<p>--tailbox file height width Display text from a file in
a dialog box, as in a &quot;tail -f&quot; com- mand. Scroll
left/right using vi-style h and l , or arrow- keys. A 0
resets the scrolling.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be re- turned.</p>

<p>--tailboxbg file height width Display text from a file
in a dialog box as a background task, as in a &quot;tail -f
&amp;&quot; command. Scroll left/right using vi-style h and
l, or arrow-keys. A 0 resets the scrolling.</p>

<p>Dialog treats the background task specially if there are
other widgets (--and-widget) on the screen concurrently.
Until those widgets are closed (e.g., an &quot;OK&quot;),
dialog will perform all of the tailboxbg widgets in the same
process, polling for updates. You may use a tab to traverse
between the widgets on the screen, and close them
individually, e.g., by pressing ENTER. Once the
non-tailboxbg widgets are closed, dialog forks a copy of
itself into the background, and prints its process id if the
&quot;--no- kill&quot; option is given.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialog s output. Only an
&quot;EXIT&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC
exit status may be re- turned.</p>

<p>NOTE: Older versions of dialog forked immediately and
attempted to update the screen individually. Besides being
bad for per- formance, it was unworkable. Some older scripts
may not work properly with the polled scheme.</p>

<p>--textbox file height width A text box lets you display
the contents of a text file in a di- alog box. It is like a
simple text file viewer. The user can move through the file
by using the cursor, page-up, page-down and HOME/END keys
available on most keyboards. If the lines are too long to be
displayed in the box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to
scroll the text region horizontally. You may also use
vi-style keys h, j, k, l in place of the cursor keys, and B
or N in place of the page-up and page-down keys. Scroll
up/down us- ing vi-style k and j , or arrow-keys. Scroll
left/right us- ing vi-style h and l, or arrow-keys. A 0
resets the left/right scrolling. For more convenience,
vi-style forward and backward searching functions are also
provided.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;EXIT&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC
exit status may be re- turned.</p>

<p>--timebox text height [width hour minute second] A
dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour, minute
and second. If the values for hour, minute or second are
miss- ing or negative, the current date s corresponding
values are used. You can increment or decrement any of those
using the left-, up-, right- and down-arrows. Use tab or
backtab to move between windows.</p>

<p>On exit, the result is printed in the form
hour:minute:second.</p>

<p>--yesno text height width A yes/no dialog box of size
height rows by width columns will be displayed. The string
specified by text is displayed inside the dialog box. If
this string is too long to fit in one line, it will be
automatically divided into multiple lines at appropriate
places. The text string can also contain the sub-string
&quot;n&quot; or newline characters n_ to control line
breaking explicitly. This dialog box is useful for asking
questions that require the user to answer either yes or no.
The dialog box has a Yes but- ton and a No button, in which
the user can switch between by pressing the TAB key.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. In
addition to the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; exit
codes (see DIAGNOSTICS) an ESC exit sta- tus may be
returned.</p>

<p>The codes used for &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;
match those used for &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;,
internally no distinction is made.</p>

<p>Obsolete Options --beep This was used to tell the
original cdialog that it should make a beep when the
separate processes of the tailboxbg widget would repaint the
screen.</p>

<p>--beep-after Beep after a user has completed a widget by
pressing one of the buttons.</p>

<p>RUN-TIME CONFIGURATION 1. Create a sample configuration
file by typing:</p>

<p>&quot;dialog --create-rc &lt;file&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>2. At start, dialog determines the settings to use as
follows:</p>

<p>a) if environment variable DIALOGRC is set, its value
determines the name of the configuration file.</p>

<p>b) if the file in (a) is not found, use the file
$HOME/.dialogrc as the configuration file.</p>

<p>c) if the file in (b) is not found, try using the
GLOBALRC file determined at compile-time, i.e.,
/etc/dialogrc.</p>

<p>d) if the file in (c) is not found, use compiled in
defaults.</p>

<p>3. Edit the sample configuration file and copy it to
some place that dialog can find, as stated in step 2
above.</p>

<p>KEY BINDINGS You can override or add to key bindings in
dialog by adding to the con- figuration file. Dialogs
bindkey command maps single keys to its in- ternal coding.
bindkey widget curses_key dialog_key The widget name can be
&quot;*&quot; (all widgets), or specific widgets such as
textbox. Specific widget bindings override the &quot;*&quot;
bindings. User-de- fined bindings override the built-in
bindings.</p>

<p>The curses_key can be any of the names derived from
curses.h, e.g., &quot;HELP&quot; from &quot;KEY_HELP&quot;.
Dialog also recognizes ANSI control characters such as
&quot;^A&quot;, &quot;^?&quot;, as well as C1-controls such
as &quot;~A&quot; and &quot;~?&quot;. Fi- nally, it allows
any single character to be escaped with a backslash.</p>

<p>Dialog s internal keycode names correspond to the
DLG_KEYS_ENUM type in dlg_keys.h, e.g., &quot;HELP&quot;
from &quot;DLGK_HELP&quot;.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DIALOGOPTS Define this variable to apply any
of the common options to each widget. Most of the common
options are reset before processing each widget. If you set
the options in this environment variable, they are applied
to dia- log s state after the reset. As in the
&quot;--file&quot; option, double-quotes and backslashes are
interpreted.</p>

<p>The &quot;--file&quot; option is not considered a common
option (so you cannot embed it within this environment vari-
able).</p>

<p>DIALOGRC Define this variable if you want to specify the
name of the configuration file to use.</p>

<p>DIALOG_CANCEL</p>

<p>DIALOG_ERROR</p>

<p>DIALOG_ESC</p>

<p>DIALOG_EXTRA</p>

<p>DIALOG_HELP</p>

<p>DIALOG_ITEM_HELP</p>

<p>DIALOG_OK Define any of these variables to change the
exit code on Cancel (1), error (-1), ESC (255), Extra (3),
Help (2), Help with --item-help (2), or OK (0). Normally
shell scripts cannot distinguish between -1 and 255.</p>

<p>DIALOG_TTY Set this variable to &quot;1&quot; to provide
compatibility with older versions of dialog which assumed
that if the script redirects the standard output, that the
&quot;--std- out&quot; option was given.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.dialogrc default configuration file</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The dialog sources contain several samples of
how to use the different box options and how they look. Just
take a look into the directory samples/ of the source.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is subject to being overridden
by environment variables. Normally they are:</p>

<p>0 if dialog is exited by pressing the Yes or OK
button.</p>

<p>1 if the No or Cancel button is pressed.</p>

<p>2 if the Help button is pressed.</p>

<p>3 if the Extra button is pressed.</p>

<p>-1 if errors occur inside dialog or dialog is exited by
pressing the ESC key.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY You may want to write scripts which run
with other dialog &quot;clones&quot;.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL DIALOG First, there is the &quot;original&quot;
dialog program to consider (versions 0.3 to 0.9). It had
some misspelled (or inconsistent) options. The dialog
program maps those deprecated options to the preferred ones.
They in- clude:</p>

<p>Option Treatment ---------------------------------
--beep-after ignored --guage mapped to --gauge</p>

<p>XDIALOG Technically, &quot;Xdialog&quot;, this is an X
application. With some care, it is possible to write useful
scripts that work with both Xdialog and di- alog.</p>

<p>The dialog program ignores these options which are
recognized by Xdia- log:</p>

<p>Option Treatment
-----------------------------------------------
--allow-close ignored --auto-placement ignored --fixed-font
ignored --icon ignored --keep-colors ignored --no-close
ignored --no-cr-wrap ignored --screen-center ignored
--separator mapped to --separate-output --smooth ignored
--under-mouse ignored --wmclass ignored</p>

<p>Xdialog s manpage has a section discussing its
compatibility with dia- log.</p>

<p>WHIPTAIL Then there is whiptail. For practical purposes,
it is maintained by Debian. Its documentation claims</p>

<p>whiptail(1) is a lightweight replacement for dialog(1),
to provide dialog boxes for shell scripts. It is built on
the newt windowing library rather than the ncurses library,
allowing it to be smaller in embedded enviroments such as
installers, rescue disks, etc.</p>

<p>whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with
dialog, but has less features: some dialog boxes are not
implemented, such as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.</p>

<p>Comparing actual sizes (Debian testing, 2007/1/10): The
total of sizes for whiptail, the newt, popt and slang
libraries is 757kb. The compa- rable number for dialog
(counting ncurses) is 520kb. Disregard the first
paragraph.</p>

<p>The second paragraph is misleading, since whiptail also
does not work for common options of dialog, such as the
gauge box. whiptail is less compatible with dialog than the
decade-old original dialog 0.4 program.</p>

<p>whiptail s manpage borrows features from dialog, e.g.,
--default-item, --output-fd, but oddly cites only dialog
versions up to 0.4 as a source. That is, its manpage refers
to features which were borrowed from more recent versions of
dialog, e.g., the --gauge and --password boxes, as well as
options such as -separate-output. Somewhat humorous- ly, one
may note that the popt feature (undocumented in its manpage)
of using a &quot;--&quot; as an escape was documented in
dialogs manpage about a year before it was mentioned in
whiptail s manpage. whiptails manpage incorrectly attributes
that to getopt (and is inaccurate anyway).</p>

<p>Debian uses whiptail for the official dialog
variation.</p>

<p>The dialog program ignores or maps these options which
are recognized by whiptail:</p>

<p>Option Treatment -------------------------------------
--fb ignored --fullbutton ignored --nocancel mapped to
--no-cancel --noitem ignored</p>

<p>BUGS Perhaps.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Thomas E. Dickey (updates for 0.9b and
beyond)</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTORS Kiran Cherupally - the mixed form and mixed
gauge widgets.</p>

<p>Tobias C. Rittweiler</p>

<p>Valery Reznic - the form and progressbox widgets.</p>

<p>Yura Kalinichenko adapted the gauge widget as
&quot;pause&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a rewrite (except as needed to provide
compatibility) of the earlier version of dialog 0.9a, which
lists as authors:</p>

<p>Savio Lam - version 0.3, &quot;dialog&quot;</p>

<p>Stuart Herbert - patch for version 0.4</p>

<p>Marc Ewing - the gauge widget.</p>

<p>Pasquale De Marco &quot;Pako&quot; - version 0.9a,
&quot;cdialog&quot;</p>
