<p>RADRELAY(8) FreeRADIUS Daemon RADRELAY(8)</p>

<p>NAME radrelay -- Deprecated command.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The functions of radrelay have been added to
radiusd. One benefit is that one instance of radiusd can
read multiple detail files, among oth- ers.</p>

<p>The rlm_sql_log module does something similar, but for
SQL queries. See its man page for details.</p>

<p>REPLICATION FOR BACKUPS Many sites run multiple radius
servers; at least one primary and one backup server. When
the primary goes down, most NASes detect that and switch to
the backup server.</p>

<p>That will cause your accounting packets to go the the
backup server - and some NASes dont even switch back to the
primary server when it comes back up.</p>

<p>The result is that accounting records are missed, and/or
the adminis- trator must jump through hoops in order to
combine the different detail files from multiple servers. It
also means that the session database (&quot;radutmp&quot;,
used for radwho and simultaneous use detection) gets out of
sync.</p>

<p>We solve this issue by &quot;relaying&quot; packets from
one server to another, so they both have the same set of
accounting data.</p>

<p>See raddb/sites-available/buffered-sql for more
information.</p>

<p>BUFFERING FOR HIGH-LOAD SERVERS If the RADIUS server
suddenly receives a many accounting packets, there may be
insufficient CPU power to process them all in a timely
manner. This problem is especially noticable when the
accounting packets are going to a back-end database.</p>

<p>Similarly, you may have one database that tracks
&quot;live&quot; sessions, and another that tracks
historical accounting data. In that case, access- ing the
first database is fast, as it is small. Accessing the second
database many be slower, as it may contain multiple
gigabytes of data. In addition, writing to the first
database in a timely manner is impor- tant, while data may
be written to the second database with a few min- utes
delay, without any harm being done.</p>

<p>See raddb/sites-available/copy-to-home-server for more
information.</p>
