<p>NAME lvresize - resize a logical volume</p>

[-n|--nofsck] [-r|--resizefs] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose]
LogicalVolumePath [PhysicalVolumePath[:PE[-PE]]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvresize allows you to resize a logical
volume. Be careful when reduc- ing a logical volume s size,
because data in the reduced part is lost!!! You should
therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is shrunk
first so that the extents that are to be removed are not in
use. Resizing snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for
informa- tion about creating snapshots) is supported as
well. But to change the number of copies in a mirrored
logical volume use lvconvert(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force resize without prompting even when it
may cause data loss.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
[+|-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Change
or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + or - sign the value is added to or sub- tracted
from the actual size of the logical volume and without it,
the value is taken as an absolute one. The number can also
be expressed as a percentage of the total space in the
Volume Group with the suffix %VG, relative to the existing
size of the Logical Volume with the suffix %LV, as a
percentage of the remaining free space of the
PhysicalVolumes on the command line with the suffix %PVS, as
a percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group
with the suffix %FREE, or (for a snap- shot) as a percentage
of the total space in the Origin Logical Volume with the
suffix %ORIGIN.</p>

<p>-n, --nofsck Do not perform fsck before resizing
filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need to use
--force to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>-r, --resizefs Resize underlying filesystem together
with the logical volume using fsadm(8).</p>

<p>-L, --size [+|-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]
Change or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.
A size suffix of M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for
ter- abytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.
With the + or - sign the value is added to or subtracted
from the actual size of the logical volume and without it,
the value is taken as an absolute one.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes to use
when extending a Logical Vol- ume. Defaults to whatever the
last segment of the Logical Vol- ume uses. Not applicable to
LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must use a
single value throughout.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. Defaults to
whatever the last segment of the Logical Volume uses. Not
applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format,
which must use a single value throughout. StripeSize must be
2^n (n = 2 to 9)</p>

<p>Examples &quot;lvresize -L+16M vg1/lv1 /dev/sda:0-1
/dev/sdb:0-1&quot; tries to extend a logical volume
&quot;vg1/lv1&quot; by 16MB using physical extents
/dev/sda:0-1 and /dev/sdb:0-1 for allocation of extents.</p>
