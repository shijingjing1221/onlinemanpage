<p>NAME osx - An SGML to XML converter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS osx [-CeghnRvx] [-aname] [-Aarchitecture]
[-bencoding] [-ccatalog_file] [-ddirectory] [-Ddirectory]
[-iname] [-ffile] [-ldtd_file] [-wwarning_type]
[-xxml_output_option...] [sysid...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION osx converts SGML to XML. osx parses and
validates the SGML document contained in</p>

<p>and writes an equivalent XML document to the standard
output. osx will warn about SGML constructs which have no
XML equivalent.</p>

<p>Part of an SGML System Conforming to International
Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language.
An SGML Extended Facilities system conforming to Annex A of
International Standard ISO/IEC 10744 --
Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available:</p>

<p>-aname, --activate=name Make doctype or linkname name
active.</p>

<p>-Aname, --architecture=name Parse with respect to
architecture name.</p>

<p>-bencoding, --encoding=encoding Use the BCTF encoding
for output. By default osx uses UTF-8.</p>

<p>-csysid, --catalog=sysid Map public identifiers and
entity names to system identifiers using the catalog entry
file whose system identifier is sysid.</p>

<p>-C, --catalogs This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-ddirectory, --entity_output_location=directory Place
output files in directory.</p>

<p>-Ddirectory, --directory=directory Search directory for
files specified in system identifiers. This has the same
effect as in onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-e, --open-entities Describe open entities in error
messages.</p>

<p>-Emax_errors, --max-errors=max_errors Give up after
max_errors errors.</p>

<p>-ffile, --error-file=file Redirect errors to file. This
is useful mainly with shells that do not support redirection
of stderr.</p>

<p>-g, --open-elements Describe open elements in error
messages.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-iname, --include=name This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-ldtd-file, --dtd_location=dtd-file Specify that the
resulting XML file should conform to the DTD in
dtd-file.</p>

<p>-n, --error-numbers Show error numbers in error
messages.</p>

<p>--references Show references in error messages.</p>

<p>-R, --restricted This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p>-wtype, --warning=type Control warnings and errors
according to type. This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-xxml_output_option,
--xml-output-option=xml_output_option Control the XML output
according to the value of xml_output_option as follows:</p>

<p>no-nl-in-tag Don&acute;t use newlines inside start-tags.
Usually osx uses newlines inside start-tags so as to reduce
the probability of excessively long lines.</p>

<p>id Output attribute declarations for ID attributes.</p>

<p>notation Output declarations for notations.</p>

<p>ndata Output declarations for external data entities.
XML requires these to be NDATA. osx will warn about CDATA
and SDATA external data entities and output them as NDATA
entities.</p>

<p>cdata Use XML CDATA sections for CDATA marked sections
and for elements with a declared content of CDATA.</p>

<p>comment Output comment declarations. Comment
declarations in the DTD will not be output.</p>

<p>lower Prefer lower case. Names that were subjected to
upper-case substitution by SGML will be folded to lower
case. This does not include reserved names; XML requires
these to be in upper-case.</p>

<p>pi-escape Escape &amp;&lt;&gt; in the contents of
processing instructions using the amp, lt and gt entities.
This allows processing instructions to contain the string
&gt;?, but requires that applications handle the
escapes.</p>

<p>empty Use the &lt;e/&gt; syntax for element types e
declared as EMPTY.</p>

<p>attlist Output an ATTLIST declaration for every element
specifying the type of all attributes. The default will
always be #IMPLIED.</p>

<p>report-input-sources Output a processing instruction to
report when an input source other than the main file is
opened or closed in the instance. Do not report any input
source changes in the DTD.</p>

<p>report-entities Output a processing instruction to
report when an external entity reference has been resolved
in the instance. Do not report any entity resolutions in the
DTD.</p>

<p>no-expand-external Preserve external entities, write a
declaration driver file named &quot;extEntities.dtf&quot;,
and include that file in the instance&acute;s internal
subset.</p>

<p>no-expand-internal Preserve internal entities, write a
declaration driver file named &quot;intEntities.dtf&quot;,
and include that file in the instance&acute;s internal
subset.</p>

<p>no-external-decl Do not include the external entities
declaration driver file in the instance&acute;s internal
subset.</p>

<p>no-internal-decl Do not include the internal entities
declaration driver file in the instance&acute;s internal
subset.</p>

<p>no-output-outside-outdir When preserving external
entities, do not write output files outside the specified
output directory (&quot;.&quot; by default). In other words,
if an external entity&acute;s system identifier includes
enough instances of &quot;..&quot; to cause osx to write a
file outside (above) the output directory, exit (by default
osx will issue a warning but will write the file and
continue.</p>

<p>no-overwrite When preserving internal or external
entities, multiple output files will be written. If this
option is specified, do not overwrite existing files;
instead, attempt to append a number to the end of the
original filename to create a unique filename. Exit with an
error if too many (100) such files already exist.</p>

<p>preserve-case Preserve casing as specified in the DTD
for element names; attribute names; attribute values which
are token lists.</p>

<p>sdata-as-pis When translating SDATA entities (whether
expanding them or providing a definition for them in the
output&acute;s internal subset), express them as processing
instructions instead of as general internal entities.</p>

<p>Multiple -x options are allowed.</p>
