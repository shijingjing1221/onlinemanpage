<p>NAME amixer - command-line mixer for ALSA soundcard
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amixer [-option] [cmd]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION amixer allows command-line control of the
mixer for the ALSA soundcard driver. amixer supports
multiple soundcards.</p>

<p>amixer with no arguments will display the current mixer
settings for the default soundcard and device. This is a
good way to see a list of the simple mixer controls you can
use.</p>

<p>COMMANDS help Shows syntax.</p>

<p>info Shows the information about a mixer device.</p>

<p>scontrols Shows a complete list of simple mixer
controls.</p>

<p>scontents Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls
with their con- tents.</p>

<p>set or sset &lt;SCONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ... Sets
the simple mixer control contents. The parameter can be the
volume either as a percentage from 0% to 100% with % suffix,
a dB gain with dB suffix (like -12.5dB), or an exact
hardware value. The dB gain can be used only for the mixer
elements with available dB information. When plus(+) or
minus(-) letter is appended after volume value, the volume
is incremented or decre- mented from the current value,
respectively.</p>

<p>The parameters cap, nocap, mute, unmute, toggle are used
to change capture (recording) and muting for the group
specified.</p>

<p>The optional modifiers can be put as extra parameters to
specify the stream direction or channels to apply. The
modifiers play- back and capture specify the stream, and the
modifiers front, rear, center, woofer are used to specify
channels to be changed.</p>

<p>A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one
device can be controlled at a time.</p>

<p>get or sget &lt;SCONTROL&gt; Shows the simple mixer
control contents.</p>

<p>A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one
device can be controlled at a time.</p>

<p>controls Shows a complete list of card controls.</p>

<p>contents Shows a complete list of card controls with
their contents.</p>

<p>cset &lt;CONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ... Sets the card
control contents. The identifier has these compo- nents:
iface, name, index, device, subdevice, numid. The next
argument specifies the value of control.</p>

<p>cget &lt;CONTROL&gt; Shows the card control contents.
The identifier has same syntax as for the cset command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c card</p>

<p>Select the card number to control. The device name
created from this parameter has syntax hw:N where N is
specified card num- ber.</p>

<p>-D device</p>

<p>Select the device name to control. The default control
name is default.</p>

<p>-s | --stdin</p>

<p>Read from stdin and execute the command on each line
sequen- tially. When this option is given, the command in
command-line arguments is ignored.</p>

<p>Only sset and cset are accepted. Other commands are
ignored. The commands to unmatched ids are ignored without
errors too.</p>

<p>-h Help: show syntax.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode. Do not show results of changes.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES amixer -c 1 sset Line,0 80%,40% unmute cap will
set the second soundcards left line input volume to 80% and
right line input to 40%, unmute it, and select it as a
source for capture (recording).</p>

<p>amixer -c 1 -- sset Master playback -20dB will set the
master volume of the second card to -20dB. If the master has
multiple channels, all channels are set to the same
value.</p>

<p>amixer -c 1 set PCM 2dB+ will increase the PCM volume of
the second card with 2dB. When both playback and capture
volumes exist, this is applied to both volumes.</p>

<p>amixer -c 2 cset iface=MIXER,name= Line Playback
Volume&quot;,index=1 40% will set the third soundcards
second line playback volume(s) to 40%</p>

<p>amixer -c 2 cset numid=34 40% will set the 34th
soundcard element to 40%</p>
