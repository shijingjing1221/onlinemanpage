<p>NAME gnutls_server_name_get - Used to get the server
name indicator send by a client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_server_name_get(gnutls_session_t session,
void * data, size_t * data_length, unsigned int * type,
unsigned int indx);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>void * data will hold the data</p>

<p>size_t * data_length will hold the data length. Must
hold the maximum size of data.</p>

<p>unsigned int * type will hold the server name indicator
type</p>

<p>unsigned int indx is the index of the server_name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will allow you to get the name
indication (if any), a client has sent. The name indication
may be any of the enumeration gnutls_server_name_type_t.</p>

<p>If type is GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, then this function is to be
used by servers that support virtual hosting, and the data
will be a null terminated UTF-8 string.</p>

<p>If data has not enough size to hold the server name
GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEM- ORY_BUFFER is returned, and data_length
will hold the required size.</p>

<p>index is used to retrieve more than one server names (if
sent by the client). The first server name has an index of
0, the second 1 and so on. If no name with the given index
exists GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is
returned.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned.</p>
