<p>DESCRIPTION lvcreate creates a new logical volume in a
volume group ( see vgcre- ate(8), vgchange(8) ) by
allocating logical extents from the free phys- ical extent
pool of that volume group. If there are not enough free
physical extents then the volume group can be extended ( see
vgex- tend(8) ) with other physical volumes or by reducing
existing logical volumes of this volume group in size ( see
lvreduce(8) ). If you spec- ify one or more PhysicalVolumes,
allocation of physical extents will be restricted to these
volumes. The second form supports the creation of snapshot
logical volumes which keep the contents of the original
logical volume for backup purposes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options.</p>

<p>-c, --chunksize ChunkSize Power of 2 chunk size for the
snapshot logical volume between 4k and 512k.</p>

<p>-C, --contiguous y|n Sets or resets the contiguous
allocation policy for logical vol- umes. Default is no
contiguous allocation based on a next free principle.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes. This
is equal to the number of physical volumes to scatter the
logical volume.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. StripeSize
must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9) for metadata in LVM1 format. For
metadata in LVM2 format, the stripe size may be a larger
power of 2 but must not exceed the physical extent size.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Gives the number
of logical extents to allocate for the new log- ical volume.
The number can also be expressed as a percentage of the
total space in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG, as a
percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group
with the suffix %FREE, as a percentage of the remaining free
space for the specified PhysicalVolume(s) with the suffix
%PVS, or (for a snapshot) as a percentage of the total space
in the Ori- gin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.</p>

<p>-L, --size LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Gives the
size to allocate for the new logical volume. A size suffix
of K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for
terabytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.
Default unit is megabytes.</p>

<p>--minor minor Set the minor number.</p>

<p>-M, --persistent y|n Set to y to make the minor number
specified persistent.</p>

<p>-m, --mirrors Mirrors Creates a mirrored logical volume
with Mirrors copies. For example, specifying &quot;-m
1&quot; would result in a mirror with two- sides; that is, a
linear volume plus one copy.</p>

<p>Specifying the optional argument --nosync will cause the
cre- ation of the mirror to skip the initial
resynchronization. Any data written afterwards will be
mirrored, but the original con- tents will not be copied.
This is useful for skipping a poten- tially long and
resource intensive initial sync of an empty device.</p>

<p>The optional argument --mirrorlog specifies the type of
log to be used. The default is disk, which is persistent and
requires a small amount of storage space, usually on a
separate device from the data being mirrored. Using core
means the mirror is regenerated by copying the data from the
first device again each time the device is activated, for
example, after every reboot. Using &quot;mirrored&quot; will
create a persistent log that is itself mirrored.</p>

<p>The optional argument --corelog is equivalent to
--mirrorlog core.</p>

<p>-n, --name LogicalVolumeName The name for the new
logical volume. Without this option a default names of
&quot;lvol#&quot; will be generated where # is the LVM
internal number of the logical volume.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--monitor y|n Start or avoid monitoring a mirrored or
snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a moni- tored mirror reports an I/O
error, the failure is handled according to
mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_pol- icy set
in lvm.conf.</p>

<p>--ignoremonitoring Make no attempt to interact with
dmeventd unless --monitor is specified.</p>

<p>-p, --permission r|rw Set access permissions to read
only or read and write. Default is read and write.</p>

<p>-r, --readahead ReadAheadSectors|auto|none Set read
ahead sector count of this logical volume. For volume groups
with metadata in lvm1 format, this must be a value between 2
and 120. The default value is &quot;auto&quot; which allows
the kernel to choose a suitable value automatically.
&quot;None&quot; is equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>-R, --regionsize MirrorLogRegionSize A mirror is divided
into regions of this size (in MB), and the mirror log uses
this granularity to track which regions are in sync.</p>

<p>-s, --snapshot Create a snapshot logical volume (or
snapshot) for an existing, so called original logical volume
(or origin). Snapshots pro- vide a frozen image of the
contents of the origin while the origin can still be
updated. They enable consistent backups and online recovery
of removed/overwritten data/files. The snapshot does not
need the same amount of storage the origin has. In a typical
scenario, 15-20% might be enough. In case the snapshot runs
out of storage, use lvextend(8) to grow it. Shrinking a
snapshot is supported by lvreduce(8) as well. Run
lvdisplay(8) on the snapshot in order to check how much data
is allocated to it. Note that a small amount of the space
you allocate to the snapshot is used to track the locations
of the chunks of data, so you should allocate slightly more
space than you actually need and monitor the rate at which
the snapshot data is growing so you can avoid running out of
space.</p>

<p>--type SegmentType Create a logical volume that uses the
specified segment type (e.g. &quot;mirror&quot;,
&quot;snapshot&quot;, &quot;striped&quot;). Especially
useful when no existing commandline switch alias enables the
use of the desired type (e.g. &quot;error&quot; or
&quot;zero&quot; types). Many segment types already have a
commandline switch alias that will enable their use (-s is
an alias for --type snapshot).</p>

<p>--virtualsize VirtualSize Create a sparse device of the
given size (in MB by default) using a snapshot. Anything
written to the device will be returned when reading from it.
Reading from other areas of the device will return blocks of
zeros. It is implemented by creat- ing a hidden virtual
device of the requested size using the zero target. A suffix
of _vorigin is used for this device.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero y|n Controls zeroing of the first KB of data
in the new logical vol- ume. Default is yes. Volume will not
be zeroed if read only flag is set. Snapshot volumes are
zeroed always.</p>

<p>Warning: trying to mount an unzeroed logical volume can
cause the system to hang.</p>

<p>Examples &quot;lvcreate -i 3 -I 8 -L 100M vg00&quot;
tries to create a striped logical volume with 3 stripes, a
stripesize of 8KB and a size of 100MB in the volume group
named vg00. The logical volume name will be chosen by
lvcreate.</p>

<p>&quot;lvcreate -m1 -L 500M vg00&quot; tries to create a
mirror logical volume with 2 sides with a useable size of
500 MiB. This operation would require 3 devices - two for
the mirror devices and one for the disk log.</p>

<p>&quot;lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog core -L 500M vg00&quot;
tries to create a mirror logical volume with 2 sides with a
useable size of 500 MiB. This oper- ation would require 2
devices - the log is &quot;in-memory&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;lvcreate --size 100m --snapshot --name snap
/dev/vg00/lvol1&quot; creates a snapshot logical volume
named /dev/vg00/snap which has access to the contents of the
original logical volume named /dev/vg00/lvol1 at snapshot
logical volume creation time. If the original logical volume
contains a file system, you can mount the snapshot logical
volume on an arbitrary directory in order to access the
contents of the filesystem to run a backup while the
original filesystem continues to get updated.</p>

<p>&quot;lvcreate --virtualsize 1T --size 100M --snapshot
--name sparse vg1&quot; creates a sparse device named
/dev/vg1/sparse of size 1TB with space for just under 100MB
of actual data on it.</p>

<p>&quot;lvcreate -L 64M -n lvol1 vg00 /dev/sda:0-7
/dev/sdb:0-7&quot; creates a linear logical volume
&quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; using physical extents /dev/sda:0-7
and /dev/sdb:0-7 for allocation of extents.</p>
