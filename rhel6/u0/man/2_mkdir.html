<p>NAME mkdir - create a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkdir() attempts to create a directory named
pathname.</p>

<p>The argument mode specifies the permissions to use. It
is modified by the process s umask in the usual way: the
permissions of the created directory are (mode &amp; ~umask
&amp; 0777). Other mode bits of the created directory depend
on the operating system. For Linux, see below.</p>

<p>The newly created directory will be owned by the
effective user ID of the process. If the directory
containing the file has the set-group-ID bit set, or if the
file system is mounted with BSD group semantics (mount -o
bsdgroups or, synonymously mount -o grpid), the new
directory will inherit the group ownership from its parent;
otherwise it will be owned by the effective group ID of the
process.</p>

<p>If the parent directory has the set-group-ID bit set
then so will the newly created directory.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE mkdir() returns zero on success, or -1 if
an error occurred (in which case, errno is set
appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The parent directory does not allow write
permission to the pro- cess, or one of the directories in
pathname did not allow search permission. (See also
path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EEXIST pathname already exists (not necessarily as a
directory). This includes the case where pathname is a
symbolic link, dangling or not.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving pathname.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist
or is a dan- gling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The device containing pathname has no room for
the new direc- tory.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The new directory cannot be created because the
users disk quota is exhausted.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in pathname is
not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file system containing pathname does not
support the cre- ation of directories.</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a file on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Under Linux apart from the permission bits, only
the S_ISVTX mode bit is honored. That is, under Linux the
created directory actually gets mode (mode &amp; ~umask
&amp; 01777). See also stat(2).</p>

<p>There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying
NFS. Some of these affect mkdir().</p>
