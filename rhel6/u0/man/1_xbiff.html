<p>NAME xbiff - mailbox flag for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xbiff [ -toolkitoption ... ] [ -option ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xbiff program displays a little image of
a mailbox. When there is no mail, the flag on the mailbox is
down. When mail arrives, the flag goes up and the mailbox
beeps. By default, pressing any mouse button in the image
forces xbiff to remember the current size of the mail file
as being the empty size and to lower the flag.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xbiff accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options along with the additional options
listed below:</p>

<p>-help This option indicates that a brief summary of the
allowed options should be printed on the standard error.</p>

<p>-update seconds This option specifies the frequency in
seconds at which xbiff should update its display. If the
mailbox is obscured and then exposed, it will be updated
immediately. The default is 30 seconds.</p>

<p>-file filename This option specifies the name of the
file which should be mon- itored. By default it watches your
inbox in the default loca- tion for your system (some
examples are /var/mail/username, /usr/spool/mail/username,
/var/spool/mail/username (where user- name is your login
name). If the MAIL environment variable is set, the file
specified by it will be monitored.</p>

<p>-volume percentage This option specifies how loud the
bell should be rung when new mail comes in.</p>

<p>-shape This option indicates that the mailbox window
should be shaped if masks for the empty or full images are
given.</p>

<p>The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments
are commonly used with xbiff:</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the X server to
contact.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry This option specifies the preferred
size and position of the mailbox window. The mailbox is 48
pixels wide and 48 pixels high and will be centered in the
window.</p>

<p>-bg color This option specifies the color to use for the
background of the window.</p>

<p>-bd color This option specifies the color to use for the
border of the window.</p>

<p>-bw number This option specifies the width in pixels of
the border sur- rounding the window.</p>

<p>-fg color This option specifies the color to use for the
foreground of the window.</p>

<p>-rv This option indicates that reverse video should be
simulated by swapping the foreground and background
colors.</p>

<p>-xrm resourcestring This option specifies a resource
string to be used. This is especially useful for setting
resources that do not have sepa- rate command line
options.</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS The application class name is XBiff. This
program uses the Mailbox widget. It understands all of the
core resource names and classes as well as:</p>

<p>checkCommand (class CheckCommand) Specifies a shell
command to be executed to check for new mail rather than
examining the size of file. The specified string value is
used as the argument to a system(3) call and may therefore
contain i/o redirection. An exit status of 0 indi- cates
that new mail is waiting, 1 indicates that there has been no
change in size, and 2 indicates that the mail has been
cleared. By default, no shell command is provided.</p>

<p>file (class File) Specifies the name of the file to
monitor. The default is as described above for the -file
command line option.</p>

<p>onceOnly (class Boolean) Specifies that the bell is only
rung the first time new mail is found and is not rung again
until at least one interval has passed with no mail waiting.
The window will continue to indi- cate the presence of new
mail until it has been retrieved. The default is false.</p>

<p>width (class Width) Specifies the width of the
mailbox.</p>

<p>height (class Height) Specifies the height of the
mailbox.</p>

<p>update (class Interval) Specifies the frequency in
seconds at which the mail should be checked. The default is
30.</p>

<p>volume (class Volume) Specifies how loud the bell should
be rung. The default is 33 percent.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) Specifies the color for
the foreground.</p>

<p>reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) Specifies that the
foreground and background should be reversed.</p>

<p>flip (class Flip) Specifies whether or not the image
that is shown when mail has arrived should be inverted. The
default is true.</p>

<p>fullPixmap (class Pixmap) Specifies a bitmap to be shown
when new mail has arrived. The default is flagup.</p>

<p>emptyPixmap (class Pixmap) Specifies a bitmap to be
shown when no new mail is present. The default is
flagdown.</p>

<p>shapeWindow (class ShapeWindow) Specifies whether or not
the mailbox window should be shaped to the given
fullPixmapMask and emptyPixmapMask. The default is
false.</p>

<p>fullPixmapMask (class PixmapMask) Specifies a mask for
the bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived. The
default is none.</p>

<p>emptyPixmapMask (class PixmapMask) Specifies a mask for
the bitmap to be shown when no new mail is present. The
default is none.</p>

<p>ACTIONS The Mailbox widget provides the following
actions for use in event translations:</p>

<p>check() This action causes the widget to check for new
mail and display the flag appropriately.</p>

<p>unset() This action causes the widget to lower the flag
until new mail comes in.</p>

<p>set() This action causes the widget to raise the flag
until the user resets it.</p>

<p>The default translation is</p>

<p>&lt;ButtonPress&gt;: unset()</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xrdb(1), stat(2)</p>

<p>BUGS The mailbox bitmaps are ugly.</p>
