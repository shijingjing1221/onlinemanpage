<p>NAME iecset - Set or dump IEC958 status bits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iecset [options] [cmd arg...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iecset is a small utility to set or dump the
IEC958 (or so-called &quot;S/PDIF&quot;) status bits of the
specified sound card via ALSA control API.</p>

<p>When iecset is started without arguments except for
options, it will show the current IEC958 status in a
human-readable form. When the com- mands are given in the
arguments, they are parsed and the IEC958 status bits are
updated. The resultant status is shown as well.</p>

<p>The commands consist of the command directive and the
argument. As the boolean argument, yes, no, true, false, or
a digit number is allowed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES iecset -Dhw:1 Displays the current IEC958
status bits on the second card. This is equivalent with -c
1.</p>

<p>iecset -x Displays the current IEC958 status bits in a
style of the argu- ments for the PCM stream. The output
string can be passed to the iec958 (or spdif) PCM type as
the optional argument.</p>

<p>iecset pro off audio off Sets the current status to the
consumer-mode and turns on the non-audio bit. The modified
status will be shown, too.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D device Specifies the device name of the
control to open</p>

<p>-c card Specifies the card index to open. Equivalent
with -Dhw:x.</p>

<p>-n index Specifies the IEC958 control element index, in
case you have multiple IEC958 devices and need to choose one
of them.</p>

<p>-x Dumps the status in the form of AESx bytes.</p>

<p>-i Reads the command sequences from stdin. Each line has
single command.</p>

<p>COMMANDS professional &lt;bool&gt; The professional mode
(true) or consumer mode (false).</p>

<p>audio &lt;bool&gt; The audio mode (true) or non-audio
mode (false).</p>

<p>rate &lt;int&gt; The sample rate in Hz.</p>

<p>emphasis &lt;int&gt; The emphasis: 0 = none, 1 =
50/15us, 2 = CCITT.</p>

<p>lock &lt;bool&gt; Rate lock: locked (true), unlocked
(false). This command is for the professional mode only.</p>

<p>sbits &lt;int&gt; Sample bits: 2 = 20bit, 4 = 24bit, 6 =
undefined. This command is for the professional mode
only.</p>

<p>wordlength &lt;int&gt; Wordlength: 0 = No, 2 = 22-18
bit, 4 = 23-19 bit, 5 = 24-20 bit, 6 = 20-16 bit. This
command is for the professional mode only.</p>

<p>category &lt;int&gt; Category: the value is from 0 to
0x7f. This command is for the consumer mode only.</p>

<p>copyright &lt;bool&gt; Copyright: copyrighted (true),
non-copyrighted (false). This command is for the consumer
mode only.</p>
