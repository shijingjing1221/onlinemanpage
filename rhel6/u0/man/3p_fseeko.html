<p>FSEEK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSEEK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fseek, fseeko - reposition a file-position
indicator in a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);</p>

<p>int fseeko(FILE *stream, off_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fseek() function shall set the
file-position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream.
If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the
stream shall be set and fseek() fails.</p>

<p>The new position, measured in bytes from the beginning
of the file, shall be obtained by adding offset to the
position specified by whence. The specified point is the
beginning of the file for SEEK_SET, the cur- rent value of
the file-position indicator for SEEK_CUR, or end-of-file for
SEEK_END.</p>

<p>If the stream is to be used with wide-character
input/output functions, the application shall ensure that
offset is either 0 or a value returned by an earlier call to
ftell() on the same stream and whence is SEEK_SET.</p>

<p>A successful call to fseek() shall clear the end-of-file
indicator for the stream and undo any effects of ungetc()
and ungetwc() on the same stream. After an fseek() call, the
next operation on an update stream may be either input or
output.</p>

<p>If the most recent operation, other than ftell(), on a
given stream is fflush(), the file offset in the underlying
open file description shall be adjusted to reflect the
location specified by fseek().</p>

<p>The fseek() function shall allow the file-position
indicator to be set beyond the end of existing data in the
file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent
reads of data in the gap shall return bytes with the value 0
until data is actually written into the gap.</p>

<p>The behavior of fseek() on devices which are incapable
of seeking is implementation-defined. The value of the file
offset associated with such a device is undefined.</p>

<p>If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been
written to the underlying file, fseek() shall cause the
unwritten data to be written to the file and shall mark the
st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file for update.</p>

<p>In a locale with state-dependent encoding, whether
fseek() restores the streams shift state is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The fseeko() function shall be equivalent to the fseek()
function except that the offset argument is of type
off_t.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fseek() and fseeko() functions shall
return 0 if they succeed.</p>

<p>Otherwise, they shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fseek() and fseeko() functions shall fail if,
either the stream is unbuffered or the streams buffer needed
to be flushed, and the call to fseek() or fseeko() causes an
underlying lseek() or write() to be invoked, and:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor and the pro- cess would be delayed in the write
operation.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying the stream file is
not open for writing or the streams buffer needed to be
flushed and the file is not open.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the process file size limit.</p>

<p>EFBIG The file is a regular file and an attempt was made
to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
corresponding stream.</p>

<p>EINTR The write operation was terminated due to the
receipt of a sig- nal, and no data was transferred.</p>

<p>EINVAL The whence argument is invalid. The resulting
file-position indicator would be set to a negative
value.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is
a member of a background process group attempting to perform
a write() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the
process is neither ignoring nor blocking SIGTTOU, and the
process group of the pro- cess is orphaned. This error may
also be returned under imple- mentation-defined
conditions.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device
containing the file.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW For fseek(), the resulting file offset would
be a value which cannot be represented correctly in an
object of type long.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW For fseeko(), the resulting file offset would
be a value which cannot be represented correctly in an
object of type off_t.</p>

<p>EPIPE An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO
that is not open for reading by any process; a SIGPIPE
signal shall also be sent to the thread.</p>

<p>ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is
associated with a pipe or FIFO.</p>
