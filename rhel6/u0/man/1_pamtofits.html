<p>NAME pamtofits - convert a Netpbm image into FITS
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtofits [-max f] [-min f] [pamfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtofits reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces
a FITS (Flexi- ble Image Transport System) file as output.
The resolution of the out- put file is either 8 bits/pixel,
or 16 bits/pixel, depending on the value of maxval in the
input file. If the input file is a PBM or PGM image, the
output file consists of a single plane image (NAXIS = 2). If
instead the input file is a PPM image, the output file will
consist of a three-plane image (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -min and -max tell pamtofits what physical
values zero and maxval sample values, respectively, in the
input image represent. Physical values are a FITS concept.
pamtofits sets up the BSCALE and BZERO FITS header cards to
indicate this information.</p>

<p>The default for -min is 0 and for -max is the maxval,
which means if you dont specify these options, the FITS
physical values are in fact the original Netpbm sample
values.</p>

<p>pamtofits always sets up the FITS header DATAMIN and
DATAMAX cards to indicate that the highest physical value in
the image is the one corre- sponding to the Netpbm maxval
and the lowest is that corresponding to Netpbm zero. This
isnt really how those cards are supposed to be used, since
the input image doesnt necessarily contain the full possi-
ble range of sample values. It is a conservative
approximation.</p>

<p>NOTES Pixel Order The FITS specification does not
specify which data in the file corre- sponds to which pixel
in the image (i.e. which bytes are the the top left pixel,
etc.). Netpbm uses the common sense, most popular arrange-
ment: row major, top to bottom, left to right. That means in
a 10 wide by 20 high image, the first 10 pixels in the file
are the top row and the last 10 are the bottom row. Within
each row, the first pixel is the leftmost one and the last
pixel is the rightmost one.</p>

<p>Netpbm has always done that, since it first understood
the FITS format in 1989, so it is something of a de facto
standard. Nobody reported trouble with that until 2008.</p>

<p>However, at least some versions of ImageMagick and Gimp
(as seen in 2008) use bottom to top order, so if you use
display a FITS image gen- erated by pamtofits, it will
appear upside down. To fix that, use pam- flip -topbottom on
the image before feeding it to pamtofits.</p>

<p>Since 2008, people have noted that NASA distributes FITS
files with bottom to top order.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtofits was originally pnmtofits and did not
handle PAM input. It was extended and renamed in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>pnmtofits was itself an extension of pgmtofits, which
was added to Pbm- plus in 1989.</p>
