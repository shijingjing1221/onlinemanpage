options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line
Name:-buttonbackground Database Name: buttonBackground
Database Class: Background</p>

<p>The background color to be used for the spin
buttons.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-buttoncursor Database Name:
buttonCursor Database Class: Cursor</p>

<p>The cursor to be used when over the spin buttons. If
this is empty (the default), a default cursor will be
used.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-buttondownrelief Database Name:
buttonDownRelief Database Class: Relief</p>

<p>The relief to be used for the upper spin button.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-buttonuprelief Database Name:
buttonUpRelief Database Class: Relief</p>

<p>The relief to be used for the lower spin button.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-command Database Name: command
Database Class: Command</p>

<p>Specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever a spinbutton
is invoked. The command recognizes several percent
substitutions: %W for the widget path, %s for the current
value of the widget, and %d for the direction of the button
pressed (up or down).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-disabledbackground Database Name:
disabledBackground Database Class: DisabledBackground</p>

<p>Specifies the background color to use when the spinbox
is dis- abled. If this option is the empty string, the
normal background color is used.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-disabledforeground Database Name:
disabledForeground Database Class: DisabledForeground</p>

<p>Specifies the foreground color to use when the spinbox
is dis- abled. If this option is the empty string, the
normal fore- ground color is used.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-format Database Name: format Database
Class: Format</p>

<p>Specifies an alternate format to use when setting the
string value when using the -from and -to range. This must
be a format specifier of the form %&lt;pad&gt;.&lt;pad&gt;f,
as it will format a float- ing-point number.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-from Database Name: from Database
Class: From</p>

<p>A floating-point value corresponding to the lowest value
for a spinbox, to be used in conjunction with -to and
-increment. When all are specified correctly, the spinbox
will use these values to control its contents. This value
must be less than the -to option. If -values is specified,
it supercedes this option.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-invalidcommand or -invcmd Database
Name: invalidCommand Database Class: InvalidCommand</p>

<p>Specifies a script to eval when validateCommand returns
0. Set- ting it to an empty string disables this feature
(the default). The best use of this option is to set it to
bell. See Valida- tion below for more information.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-increment Database Name: increment
Database Class: Increment</p>

<p>A floating-point value specifying the increment. When
used with -from and -to, the value in the widget will be
adjusted by -increment when a spin button is pressed (up
adds the value, down subtracts the value).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-readonlybackground Database Name:
readonlyBackground Database Class: ReadonlyBackground</p>

<p>Specifies the background color to use when the spinbox
is read- only. If this option is the empty string, the
normal background color is used.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the spinbox: normal,
dis- abled, or readonly. If the spinbox is readonly, then
the value may not be changed using widget commands and no
insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input focus
is in the widget; the contents of the widget may still be
selected. If the spinbox is disabled, the value may not be
changed, no insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents
will not be selectable, and the spin- box may be displayed
in a different color, depending on the val- ues of the
-disabledforeground and -disabledbackground options.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-to Database Name: to Database Class:
To</p>

<p>A floating-point value corresponding to the highest
value for the spinbox, to be used in conjunction with -from
and -incre- ment. When all are specified correctly, the
spinbox will use these values to control its contents. This
value must be greater than the -from option. If -values is
specified, it supercedes this option.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-validate Database Name: validate
Database Class: Validate</p>

<p>Specifies the mode in which validation should operate:
none, focus, focusin, focusout, key, or all. It defaults to
none. When you want validation, you must explicitly state
which mode you wish to use. See Validation below for
more.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-validatecommand or -vcmd Database
Name: validateCommand Database Class: ValidateCommand</p>

<p>Specifies a script to evaluate when you want to validate
the input in the widget. Setting it to an empty string
disables this feature (the default). Validation occurs
according to the value of -validate. This command must
return a valid Tcl boolean value. If it returns 0 (or the
valid Tcl boolean equiv- alent) then the value of the widget
will not change and the invalidCommand will be evaluated if
it is set. If it returns 1, then value will be changed. See
Validation below for more information.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-values Database Name: values Database
Class: Values</p>

<p>Must be a proper list value. If specified, the spinbox
will use these values as to control its contents, starting
with the first value. This option has precedence over the
-from and -to range.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies an integer value indicating the desired width
of the spinbox window, in average-size characters of the
widgets font. If the value is less than or equal to zero,
the widget picks a size just large enough to hold its
current text.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-wrap Database Name: wrap Database
Class: wrap</p>

<p>Must be a proper boolean value. If on, the spinbox will
wrap around the values of data in the widget.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The spinbox command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argu- ment) and makes it into a
spinbox widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the spinbox such as its colors, font,
and relief. The spinbox command returns its pathName
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must
not exist a window named path- Name, but pathNames parent
must exist.</p>

<p>A spinbox is an extended entry widget that allows he
user to move, or spin, through a fixed set of ascending or
descending values such as times or dates in addition to
editing the value as in an entry. When first created, a
spinboxs string is empty. A portion of the spinbox may be
selected as described below. If a spinbox is exporting its
selection (see the exportSelection option), then it will
observe the standard protocols for handling the selection;
spinbox selections are available as type STRING. Spinboxes
also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with the
input focus. When a spinbox has the input focus it displays
an insertion cursor to indicate where new characters will be
inserted.</p>

<p>Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too
long to fit entirely within the widgets window. In this
case, only a portion of the string will be displayed;
commands described below may be used to change the view in
the window. Spinboxes use the standard xScrollCom- mand
mechanism for interacting with scrollbars (see the
description of the xScrollCommand option for details). They
also support scanning, as described below.</p>

<p>VALIDATION Validation works by setting the
validateCommand option to a script which will be evaluated
according to the validate option as follows:</p>

<p>none Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>

<p>focus validateCommand will be called when the spinbox
receives or loses focus.</p>

<p>focusin validateCommand will be called when the spinbox
receives focus.</p>

<p>focusout validateCommand will be called when the spinbox
loses focus.</p>

<p>key validateCommand will be called when the spinbox is
edited.</p>

<p>all validateCommand will be called for all above
conditions.</p>

<p>It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the
validateCommand and invalidCommand, just as you would in a
bind script. The following substitutions are recognized:</p>

<p>%d Type of action: 1 for insert, 0 for delete, or -1 for
focus, forced or textvariable validation.</p>

<p>%i Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any,
otherwise -1.</p>

<p>%P The value of the spinbox should edition occur. If you
are config- uring the spinbox widget to have a new
textvariable, this will be the value of that
textvariable.</p>

<p>%s The current value of spinbox before edition.</p>

<p>%S The text string being inserted/deleted, if any.
Otherwise it is an empty string.</p>

<p>%v The type of validation currently set.</p>

<p>%V The type of validation that triggered the callback
(key, focusin, focusout, forced).</p>

<p>%W The name of the spinbox widget.</p>

<p>In general, the textVariable and validateCommand can be
dangerous to mix. Any problems have been overcome so that
using the validateCommand will not interfere with the
traditional behavior of the spinbox widget. Using the
textVariable for read-only purposes will never cause prob-
lems. The danger comes when you try set the textVariable to
something that the validateCommand would not accept, which
causes validate to become none (the invalidCommand will not
be triggered). The same hap- pens when an error occurs
evaluating the validateCommand.</p>

<p>Primarily, an error will occur when the validateCommand
or invalidCom- mand encounters an error in its script while
evaluating or validateCom- mand does not return a valid Tcl
boolean value. The validate option will also set itself to
none when you edit the spinbox widget from within either the
validateCommand or the invalidCommand. Such editions will
override the one that was being validated. If you wish to
edit the value of the widget during validation and still
have the validate option set, you should include the command
%W config -validate %v in the validateCommand or
invalidCommand (whichever one you were edit- ing the spinbox
widget from). It is also recommended to not set an
associated textVariable during validation, as that can cause
the spin- box widget to become out of sync with the
textVariable.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The spinbox command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the
command.</p>

<p>INDICES Many of the widget commands for spinboxes take
one or more indices as arguments. An index specifies a
particular character in the spinboxs string, in any of the
following ways:</p>

<p>number Specifies the character as a numerical index,
where 0 cor- responds to the first character in the
string.</p>

<p>anchor Indicates the anchor point for the selection,
which is set with the select from and select adjust widget
commands.</p>

<p>end Indicates the character just after the last one in
the spinbox s string. This is equivalent to specifying a
numerical index equal to the length of the spinboxs
string.</p>

<p>insert Indicates the character adjacent to and
immediately follow- ing the insertion cursor.</p>

<p>sel.first Indicates the first character in the
selection. It is an error to use this form if the selection
is not in the spin- box window.</p>

<p>sel.last Indicates the character just after the last one
in the selection. It is an error to use this form if the
selec- tion is not in the spinbox window.</p>

<p>@number In this form, number is treated as an
x-coordinate in the spinbox s window; the character spanning
that x-coordinate is used. For example, @0 indicates the
left-most charac- ter in the window.</p>

<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above,
e.g. e or sel.f. In general, out-of-range indices are
automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.</p>

<p>SUBCOMMANDS The following commands are possible for
spinbox widgets:</p>

<p>pathName bbox index Returns a list of four numbers
describing the bounding box of the character given by index.
The first two elements of the list give the x and y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget)
and the last two elements give the width and height of the
character, in pixels. The bounding box may refer to a region
outside the visible area of the window.</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the spin- box command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the spinbox command.</p>

<p>pathName delete first ?last? Delete one or more elements
of the spinbox. First is the index of the first character to
delete, and last is the index of the character just after
the last one to delete. If last is not specified it defaults
to first+1, i.e. a single character is deleted. This command
returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName get Returns the spinboxs string.</p>

<p>pathName icursor index Arrange for the insertion cursor
to be displayed just before the character given by index.
Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName identify x y Returns the name of the window
element corresponding to coordi- nates x and y in the
spinbox. Return value is one of: none, buttondown, buttonup,
entry.</p>

<p>pathName index index Returns the numerical index
corresponding to index.</p>

<p>pathName insert index string Insert the characters of
string just before the character indi- cated by index.
Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName invoke element Causes the specified element,
either buttondown or buttonup, to be invoked, triggering the
action associated with it.</p>

<p>pathName scan option args This command is used to
implement scanning on spinboxes. It has two forms, depending
on option:</p>

<p>pathName scan mark x Records x and the current view in
the spinbox window; used in conjunction with later scan
dragto commands. Typically this command is associated with a
mouse button press in the widget. It returns an empty
string.</p>

<p>pathName scan dragto x This command computes the
difference between its x argu- ment and the x argument to
the last scan mark command for the widget. It then adjusts
the view left or right by 10 times the difference in
x-coordinates. This command is typically associated with
mouse motion events in the wid- get, to produce the effect
of dragging the spinbox at high speed through the window.
The return value is an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName selection option arg This command is used to
adjust the selection within a spinbox. It has several forms,
depending on option:</p>

<p>pathName selection adjust index Locate the end of the
selection nearest to the character given by index, and
adjust that end of the selection to be at index (i.e.
including but not going beyond index). The other end of the
selection is made the anchor point for future select to
commands. If the selection is not currently in the spinbox,
then a new selection is created to include the characters
between index and the most recent selection anchor point,
inclusive. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName selection clear Clear the selection if it is
currently in this widget. If the selection is not in this
widget then the command has no effect. Returns an empty
string.</p>

<p>pathName selection element ?element? Sets or gets the
currently selected element. If a spin- button element is
specified, it will be displayed depressed.</p>

<p>pathName selection from index Set the selection anchor
point to just before the charac- ter given by index. Does
not change the selection. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName selection present Returns 1 if there is are
characters selected in the spinbox, 0 if nothing is
selected.</p>

<p>pathName selection range start end Sets the selection to
include the characters starting with the one indexed by
start and ending with the one just before end. If end refers
to the same character as start or an earlier one, then the
spinbox s selection is cleared.</p>

<p>pathName selection to index If index is before the
anchor point, set the selection to the characters from index
up to but not including the anchor point. If index is the
same as the anchor point, do nothing. If index is after the
anchor point, set the selection to the characters from the
anchor point up to but not including index. The anchor point
is determined by the most recent select from or select
adjust command in this widget. If the selection is not in
this widget then a new selection is created using the most
recent anchor point specified for the widget. Returns an
empty string.</p>

<p>pathName set ?string? If string is specified, the
spinbox will try and set it to this value, otherwise it just
returns the spinbox s string. If vali- dation is on, it will
occur when setting the string.</p>

<p>pathName validate This command is used to force an
evaluation of the validateCom- mand independent of the
conditions specified by the validate option. This is done by
temporarily setting the validate option to all. It returns 0
or 1.</p>

<p>pathName xview args This command is used to query and
change the horizontal position of the text in the widgets
window. It can take any of the fol- lowing forms:</p>

<p>pathName xview Returns a list containing two elements.
Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1; together
they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the
window. For example, if the first element is .2 and the
second ele- ment is .6, 20% of the spinboxs text is
off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the
window, and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right.
These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
-xscrollcom- mand option.</p>

<p>pathName xview index Adjusts the view in the window so
that the character given by index is displayed at the left
edge of the win- dow.</p>

<p>pathName xview moveto fraction Adjusts the view in the
window so that the character fraction of the way through the
text appears at the left edge of the window. Fraction must
be a fraction between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>pathName xview scroll number what This command shifts
the view in the window left or right according to number and
what. Number must be an integer. What must be either units
or pages or an abbreviation of one of these. If what is
units, the view adjusts left or right by number
average-width characters on the display; if it is pages then
the view adjusts by number screen- fuls. If number is
negative then characters farther to the left become visible;
if it is positive then charac- ters farther to the right
become visible.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings
for spinboxes that give them the following default behavior.
In the descriptions below, word refers to a contiguous group
of letters, digits, or _ characters, or any single character
other than these.</p>

<p>[1] Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion
cursor just before the character underneath the mouse
cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any
selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse button 1
strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the
character under the mouse.</p>

<p>[2] Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word
under the mouse and positions the insertion cursor at the
beginning of the word. Dragging after a double click will
stroke out a selection consisting of whole words.</p>

<p>[3] Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of
the text in the spinbox and positions the insertion cursor
before the first character.</p>

<p>[4] The ends of the selection can be adjusted by
dragging with mouse button 1 while the Shift key is down;
this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest
to the mouse cursor when but- ton 1 was pressed. If the
button is double-clicked before drag- ging then the
selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>

<p>[5] Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down
will position the insertion cursor in the spinbox without
affecting the selec- tion.</p>

<p>[6] If any normal printing characters are typed in a
spinbox, they are inserted at the point of the insertion
cursor.</p>

<p>[7] The view in the spinbox can be adjusted by dragging
with mouse button 2. If mouse button 2 is clicked without
moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the spinbox
at the position of the mouse cursor.</p>

<p>[8] If the mouse is dragged out of the spinbox on the
left or right sides while button 1 is pressed, the spinbox
will automatically scroll to make more text visible (if
there is more text off- screen on the side where the mouse
left the window).</p>

<p>[9] The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor
one character to the left or right; they also clear any
selection in the spinbox and set the selection anchor. If
Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then the
insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to
include the new character. Control- Left and Control-Right
move the insertion cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left
and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor by words
and also extend the selection. Control-b and Control-f
behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and
Meta-f behave the same as Control-Left and Control- Right,
respectively.</p>

<p>[10] The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion
cursor to the beginning of the spinbox and clear any
selection in the spinbox. Shift-Home moves the insertion
cursor to the beginning of the spinbox and also extends the
selection to that point.</p>

<p>[11] The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion
cursor to the end of the spinbox and clear any selection in
the spinbox. Shift-End moves the cursor to the end and
extends the selection to that point.</p>

<p>[12] The Select key and Control-Space set the selection
anchor to the position of the insertion cursor. They do not
affect the cur- rent selection. Shift-Select and
Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to the current
position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor
to the insertion cursor if there was not any selection
previously.</p>

<p>[13] Control-/ selects all the text in the spinbox.</p>

<p>[14] Control- clears any selection in the spinbox.</p>

<p>[15] The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun
workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget
to the clipboard, if there is a selection.</p>

<p>[16] The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations)
or Control-w copies the selection in the widget to the
clipboard and deletes the selection. If there is no
selection in the widget then these keys have no effect.</p>

<p>[17] The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun
workstations) or Con- trol-y inserts the contents of the
clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.</p>

<p>[18] The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is
one in the spinbox. If there is no selection, it deletes the
character to the right of the insertion cursor.</p>

<p>[19] The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the
selection, if there is one in the spinbox. If there is no
selection, it deletes the character to the left of the
insertion cursor.</p>

<p>[20] Control-d deletes the character to the right of the
insertion cursor.</p>

<p>[21] Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the
insertion cursor.</p>

<p>[22] Control-k deletes all the characters to the right
of the inser- tion cursor.</p>

<p>[23] Control-t reverses the order of the two characters
to the right of the insertion cursor.</p>

<p>If the spinbox is disabled using the -state option, then
the spinboxs view can still be adjusted and text in the
spinbox can still be selected, but no insertion cursor will
be displayed and no text modifi- cations will take
place.</p>

<p>The behavior of spinboxes can be changed by defining new
bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.</p>
