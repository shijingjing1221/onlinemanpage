<p>DESCRIPTION These functions make queries to and
interpret the responses from Inter- net domain name
servers.</p>

<p>The res_init() function reads the configuration files
(see resolv.conf(5)) to get the default domain name, search
order and name server address(es). If no server is given,
the local host is tried. If no domain is given, that
associated with the local host is used. It can be overridden
with the environment variable LOCALDOMAIN. res_init() is
normally executed by the first call to one of the other
functions.</p>

<p>The res_query() function queries the name server for the
fully quali- fied domain name name of specified type and
class. The reply is left in the buffer answer of length
anslen supplied by the caller.</p>

<p>The res_search() function makes a query and waits for
the response like res_query(), but in addition implements
the default and search rules controlled by RES_DEFNAMES and
RES_DNSRCH (see description of _res options below).</p>

<p>The res_querydomain() function makes a query using
res_query() on the concatenation of name and domain.</p>

<p>The following functions are lower-level routines used by
res_query().</p>

<p>The res_mkquery() function constructs a query message in
buf of length buflen for the domain name dname. The query
type op is usually QUERY, but can be any of the types
defined in &lt;arpa/nameser.h&gt;. newrr is cur- rently
unused.</p>

<p>The res_send() function sends a pre-formatted query
given in msg of length msglen and returns the answer in
answer which is of length anslen. It will call res_init(),
if it has not already been called.</p>

<p>The dn_comp() function compresses the domain name exp_dn
and stores it in the buffer comp_dn of length length. The
compression uses an array of pointers dnptrs to previously
compressed names in the current mes- sage. The first pointer
points to the beginning of the message and the list ends
with NULL. The limit of the array is specified by lastdnptr.
If dnptr is NULL, domain names are not compressed. If
lastdnptr is NULL, the list of labels is not updated.</p>

<p>The dn_expand() function expands the compressed domain
name comp_dn to a full domain name, which is placed in the
buffer exp_dn of size length. The compressed name is
contained in a query or reply message, and msg points to the
beginning of the message.</p>

<p>The resolver routines use global configuration and state
information contained in the structure _res, which is
defined in &lt;resolv.h&gt;. The only field that is normally
manipulated by the user is _res.options. This field can
contain the bitwise &quot;OR&quot; of the following
options:</p>

<p>RES_INIT True if res_init() has been called.</p>

<p>RES_DEBUG Print debugging messages.</p>

<p>RES_AAONLY Accept authoritative answers only. res_send()
continues until it finds an authoritative answer or returns
an error. [Not cur- rently implemented].</p>

<p>RES_USEVC Use TCP connections for queries rather than
UDP datagrams.</p>

<p>RES_PRIMARY Query primary domain name server only.</p>

<p>RES_IGNTC Ignore truncation errors. Don t retry with
TCP. [Not currently implemented].</p>

<p>RES_RECURSE Set the recursion desired bit in queries.
Recursion is carried out by the domain name server, not by
res_send(). [Enabled by default].</p>

<p>RES_DEFNAMES If set, res_search() will append the
default domain name to sin- gle component names, i.e., those
that do not contain a dot. [Enabled by default].</p>

<p>RES_STAYOPEN Used with RES_USEVC to keep the TCP
connection open between queries.</p>

<p>RES_DNSRCH If set, res_search() will search for
hostnames in the current domain and in parent domains. This
option is used by gethostbyname(3). [Enabled by
default].</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The res_init() function returns 0 on
success, or -1 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>The res_query(), res_search(), res_querydomain(),
res_mkquery() and res_send() functions return the length of
the response, or -1 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>The dn_comp() and dn_expand() functions return the
length of the com- pressed name, or -1 if an error
occurs.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/resolv.conf resolver configuration file
/etc/host.conf resolver configuration file</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD.</p>
