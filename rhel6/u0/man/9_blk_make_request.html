<p>BLK_MAKE_REQUEST(9) Block Devices
BLK_MAKE_REQUEST(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_make_request - given a bio, allocate a
corresponding struct request.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct request * blk_make_request(struct
request_queue * q, struct bio * bio, gfp_t gfp_mask);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q target request queue</p>

<p>bio The bio describing the memory mappings that will be
submitted for IO. It may be a chained-bio properly
constructed by block/bio layer.</p>

<p>gfp_mask gfp flags to be used for memory allocation</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION blk_make_request is the parallel of
generic_make_request for BLOCK_PC type commands. Where the
struct request needs to be farther initialized by the
caller. It is passed a struct bio, which describes the
memory info of the I/O transfer.</p>

<p>The caller of blk_make_request must make sure that
bi_io_vec are set to describe the memory buffers. That
bio_data_dir will return the needed direction of the
request. (And all bio&acute;s in the passed bio-chain are
properly set accordingly)</p>

<p>If called under none-sleepable conditions, mapped bio
buffers must not need bouncing, by calling the appropriate
masked or flagged allocator, suitable for the target device.
Otherwise the call to blk_queue_bounce will BUG.</p>

<p>WARNING When allocating/cloning a bio-chain, careful
consideration should be given to how you allocate bios. In
particular, you cannot use __GFP_WAIT for anything but the
first bio in the chain. Otherwise you risk waiting for IO
completion of a bio that hasn&acute;t been submitted yet,
thus resulting in a deadlock. Alternatively bios should be
allocated using bio_kmalloc instead of bio_alloc, as that
avoids the mempool deadlock. If possible a big IO should be
split into smaller parts when allocation fails. Partial
allocation should not be an error, or you risk a
live-lock.</p>
