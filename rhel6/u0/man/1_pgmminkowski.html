<p>NAME pgmminkowski - compute Minkowski integral</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmminkowski pgmfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmminkowski computes the 3 Minkowski integrals of a PGM
image.</p>

<p>The Minkowski integrals mathematically characterize the
shapes in the image and hence are the basis of
&quot;morphological image analysis.&quot;</p>

<p>Hadwiger s theorem has it that these integrals are the
only motion- invariant, additive and conditionally
continuous functions of a two- dimensional image, which
means that they are preserved under certain kinds of
deformations of the image. On top of that, they are very
easy and quickly calculated. This makes them of interest for
certain kinds of pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Basically, the Minkowski integrals are the area, total
perimeter length, and the Euler characteristic of the image,
where these metrics apply to the foreground image, not the
rectangular PGM image itself. The foreground image consists
of all the pixels in the image that are white. For a
grayscale image, there is some threshold of intensity
applied to categorize pixels into black and white, and the
Minkowski integrals are calculated as a function of this
threshold value. The total surface area refers to the number
of white pixels in the PGM and the perimeter is the sum of
perimeters of each closed white region in the PGM.</p>

<p>For a grayscale image, these numbers are a function of
the threshold of what you want to call black or white.
pgmminkowski reports these num- bers as a function of the
threshold for all possible threshold values. Since the total
surface area can increase only as a function of the
threshold, it is a reparameterization of the threshold. It
turns out that if you consider the other two functions, the
boundary length and the Euler characteristic, as a function
of the first one, the surface, you get two functions that
are a fingerprint of the picture. This fin- gerprint is e.g.
sufficient to recognize the difference between pic- tures of
different crystal lattices under a scanning tunnelling elec-
tron microscope.</p>
