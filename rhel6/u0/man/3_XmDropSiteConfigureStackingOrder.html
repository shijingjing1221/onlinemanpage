<p>NAME XmDropSiteConfigureStackingOrder A Drag and Drop
function that reorders a stack of widgets that are
registered drop sites</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/DragDrop.h&gt; void
XmDropSiteConfigureStackingOrder( Widget widget, Widget
sibling, Cardinal stack_mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmDropSiteConfigureStackingOrder changes the
stacking order of the drop site specified by widget. The
stacking order controls the manner in which drag-under
effects are clipped by overlapping siblings, regard- less of
whether they are active. The stack mode is relative either
to the entire stack, or to another drop site within the
stack. The stack order can be modified only if the drop
sites are siblings in both the widget and drop site
hierarchy, and the widget parent of the drop sites is
registered as a composite drop site.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the drop site to be restacked.</p>

<p>sibling Specifies a sibling drop site for stacking
operations. If specified, then widget is restacked relative
to this drop sites stack position.</p>

<p>stack_mode Specifies the new stack position for the
specified widget. The values are XmABOVE and XmBELOW. If a
sibling is speci- fied, then widget is restacked as
follows:</p>

<p>XmABOVE The widget is placed just above the sibling.</p>

<p>XmBELOW The widget is placed just below the sibling.</p>

<p>If the sibling parameter is not specified, then widget
is restacked as follows:</p>

<p>XmABOVE The widget is placed at the top of the
stack.</p>

<p>XmBELOW The widget is placed at the bottom of the
stack.</p>
