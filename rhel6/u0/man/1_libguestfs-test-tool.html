<p>LIBGUESTFS-TEST-TOOL(1) Virtualization Support
LIBGUESTFS-TEST-TOOL(1)</p>

<p>NAME libguestfs-test-tool - End user tests for
libguestfs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS libguestfs-test-tool [--options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libguestfs-test-tool is a test program
shipped with libguestfs to end users and developers, to
allow them to check basic libguestfs functionality is
working. This is needed because libguestfs occasionally
breaks for reasons beyond our control: usually because of
changes in the underlying qemu or kernel packages, or the
host environment.</p>

<p>If you suspect a problem in libguestfs, then just
run:</p>

<p>libguestfs-test-tool</p>

<p>It will print lots of diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>If it runs to completion successfully, you will see this
near the end:</p>

<p>===== TEST FINISHED OK =====</p>

<p>and the test tool will exit with code 0.</p>

<p>If it fails (and/or exits with non-zero error code),
please paste the complete, unedited output of the test tool
into a bug report. More information about reporting bugs can
be found on the &lt;http://libguestfs.org/&gt; website.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display short usage information and
exit.</p>

<p>--helper /path/to/libguestfs-test-tool-helper Pass an
alternate name for the helper program. libguestfs-test- tool
will normally look in the $libexec directory that was
configured when the tool was built.</p>

<p>--qemu qemu_binary If you have downloaded another qemu
binary, point this option at the full path of the binary to
try it.</p>

<p>--qemudir qemu_source_dir If you have compiled qemu from
source, point this option at the source directory to try
it.</p>

<p>--timeout N Set the launch timeout to &quot;N&quot;
seconds. The default is 120 seconds which does not usually
need to be adjusted unless your machine is very slow.</p>

<p>TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU If you have
compiled another version of qemu from source and would like
to try that, then you can use the --qemudir option to point
to the qemu source directory.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded a qemu binary from somewhere, use
the --qemu option to point to the binary.</p>

<p>When using an alternate qemu with libguestfs, usually
you would need to write a qemu wrapper script (see section
QEMU WRAPPERS in guestfs(3)). libguestfs-test-tool writes a
temporary qemu wrapper script when you use either of the
--qemudir or --qemu options.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE libguestfs-test-tool returns 0 if the tests
completed without error, or 1 if there was an error.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/libexec/libguestfs-test-tool-helper This
helper program is run inside the appliance and provides
additional tests.</p>

<p>/usr/bin/mkisofs The &quot;mkisofs&quot; command is
required in order to construct a CD-ROM ISO file which is
used as part of the tests.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES For the full list of environment
variables which may affect libguestfs, please see the
guestfs(3) manual page.</p>
