<p>GETPWNAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETPWNAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getpwnam, getpwnam_r - search user database for a
name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *getpwnam(const char *name);</p>

<p>int getpwnam_r(const char *name, struct passwd *pwd,
char *buffer, size_t bufsize, struct passwd **result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getpwnam() function shall search the
user database for an entry with a matching name.</p>

<p>The getpwnam() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>Applications wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to 0 before calling getpwnam(). If
getpwnam() returns a null pointer and errno is non-zero, an
error occurred.</p>

<p>The getpwnam_r() function shall update the passwd
structure pointed to by pwd and store a pointer to that
structure at the location pointed to by result. The
structure shall contain an entry from the user database with
a matching name. Storage referenced by the structure is
allocated from the memory provided with the buffer
parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. The maximum size
needed for this buffer can be deter- mined with the
{_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX} sysconf() parameter. A NULL pointer
shall be returned at the location pointed to by result on
error or if the requested entry is not found.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getpwnam() function shall return a
pointer to a struct passwd with the structure as defined in
&lt;pwd.h&gt; with a matching entry if found. A null pointer
shall be returned if the requested entry is not found, or an
error occurs. On error, errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getpwent(), getpwnam(),
or getpwuid().</p>

<p>If successful, the getpwnam_r() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getpwnam() and getpwnam_r() functions may
fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during getpwnam().</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The getpwnam_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and
bufsize to con- tain the data to be referenced by the
resulting passwd struc- ture.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting an Entry for the Login Name The
following example uses the getlogin() function to return the
name of the user who logged in; this information is passed
to the getpwnam() function to get the user database entry
for that user.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; ... char *lgn; struct passwd *pw; ... if
((lgn = getlogin()) == NULL || (pw = getpwnam(lgn)) == NULL)
{ fprintf(stderr, &quot;Get of user information
failedn&quot;); exit(1); } ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Three names associated with the
current process can be determined: get- pwuid( geteuid())
returns the name associated with the effective user ID of
the process; getlogin() returns the name associated with the
cur- rent login activity; and getpwuid( getuid()) returns
the name associ- ated with the real user ID of the
process.</p>

<p>The getpwnam_r() function is thread-safe and returns
values in a user- supplied buffer instead of possibly using
a static data area that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
