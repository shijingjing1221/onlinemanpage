<p>USB_RESET_DEVICE(9) USB Core APIs
USB_RESET_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_reset_device - warn interface drivers and
perform a USB port reset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_reset_device(struct usb_device *
udev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS udev device to reset (not in SUSPENDED or
NOTATTACHED state)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Warns all drivers bound to registered
interfaces (using their pre_reset method), performs the port
reset, and then lets the drivers know that the reset is over
(using their post_reset method).</p>

<p>Return value is the same as for
usb_reset_and_verify_device.</p>

<p>The caller must own the device lock. For example,
it&acute;s safe to use this from a driver probe routine
after downloading new firmware. For calls that might not
occur during probe, drivers should lock the device using
usb_lock_device_for_reset.</p>

<p>If an interface is currently being probed or
disconnected, we assume its driver knows how to handle
resets. For all other interfaces, if the driver
doesn&acute;t have pre_reset and post_reset methods then we
attempt to unbind it and rebind afterward.</p>
