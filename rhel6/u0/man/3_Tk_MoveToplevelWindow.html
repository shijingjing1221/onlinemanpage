<p>DESCRIPTION In general, a window should never set its
own position; this should be done only by the geometry
manger that is responsible for the window. For top-level
windows the window manager is effectively the geometry
manager; Tk provides interface code between the application
and the window manager to convey the applications desires to
the geometry man- ager. The desired size for a top-level
window is conveyed using the usual Tk_GeometryRequest
mechanism. The procedure Tk_MoveToplevelWin- dow may be used
by an application to request a particular position for a
top-level window; this procedure is similar in function to
the wm geometry Tcl command except that negative offsets
cannot be specified. It is invoked by widgets such as menus
that want to appear at a partic- ular place on the
screen.</p>

<p>When Tk_MoveToplevelWindow is called it does not
immediately pass on the new desired location to the window
manager; it defers this action until all other outstanding
work has been completed, using the Tk_DoWhenIdle
mechanism.</p>
