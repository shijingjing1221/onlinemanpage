<p>NAME pnmtorle - convert a Netpbm image file into an RLE
image file.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtorle</p>

<p>[-h] [-v] [-a] [-o outfile] [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program converts Netpbm image files into Utah RLE
image files. You can include an alpha mask. If the input is
a multiple image file, the output consists of several
concatenated RLE images.</p>

<p>The RLE file will contain either a three channel color
image (24 bits) or a single channel grayscale image (8 bits)
depending upon the pnm file depth. If a converted ppm is
displayed on an 8 bit display, the image must be dithered.
In order to produce a better looking image (on 8 bit
displays), it is recommended that the image be quantizing
(to 8 bit mapped color) prior to its display. This may be
done by piping the output of this program into the Utah mcut
or rlequant utilities. We show an example of this later.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v This option will cause pnmtorle to operate in
verbose mode. The header information is written to stderr .
Actually, there is not much header information stored in a
Netpbm file, so this information is minimal.</p>

<p>-h This option allows the header of the Netpbm image to
be dumped to stderr without converting the file. It is
equivalent to using the -v option except that no file
conversion takes place.</p>

<p>-a This option causes pnmtorle to include an alpha
channel in the output image. The alpha channel is based on
the image: Wher- ever a pixel is black, the corresponding
alpha value is trans- parent. Everywhere else, the alpha
value is fully opaque.</p>

<p>-o outfile If you specify this option, pnmtorle writes
the output to this file. If outfile is - or you dont specify
-o, pnmtorle writes the output to Standard Output.</p>

<p>pnmfile The name of the Netpbm image data file to be
converted. If not specified, standard input is assumed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES pnmtorle -v file.ppm -o file.rle</p>

<p>While running in verbose mode, convert file.ppm to RLE
format and store resulting data in file.rle.</p>

<p>pnmtorle -h file.pgm</p>

<p>Dump the header information of the Netpbm file called
file.pgm.</p>
