<p>TN5250RC(5) TN5250RC(5)</p>

<p>NAME tn5250rc - tn5250 and lp5250d configuration
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tn5250rc file contains groups of options
for tn5250 and lp5250d. When a hostname is passed to one of
these programs, the named group is looked up in tn5250rc,
and any options given in that group are pro- cessed.</p>

<p>If a named group is found, and defines a host option,
that option spec- ifies the server. Otherwise, the host
parameter to the program is used.</p>

<p>A group of options looks like this:</p>

<p>groupname { +boolean option=value ... }</p>

<p>Each group of options starts with the group name,
followed by a left brace (curly bracket) character.
Following lines should have one option on each line. The
last line of the group has a single right brace.</p>

<p>The global tn5250rc file may be overridden by the user s
~/.tn5250rc file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options given here may be used inside a
section of the configura- tion file, or on the tn5250 or
lp5250d command line. Most options take the form
OPTION=VALUE. Options listed with a leading +/- can be
either turned on (+OPTION) or off (-OPTION).</p>

<p>Common Options These options apply to both printer and
display emulation sessions.</p>

<p>host=URL Set the host to connect to. The URL is of the
form [PROTO- COL:]HOSTNAME[:PORT]. The default protocol, if
not supplied, is tn5250. See Protocols below for
descriptions of the available protocols.</p>

<p>map=CCSID Set the translation table between ASCII and
EBCDIC. This should match the CCSID of the interactive job.
The default is 37. See Translation Maps below for more
information.</p>

<p>env.DEVNAME=NAME Set the device name for the AS/400 to
assign to the 5250 ses- sion. This should be up to ten
characters long and consist of only letters and numbers. It
will be converted to uppercase and used as the name of the
5250-compatible device on the AS/400. There may only be one
session active with any given name at one time.</p>

<p>trace=TRACEFILE Log all actions to TRACEFILE. This file
will get very large, and may contain sensitive information
such as the password used to log in.</p>

<p>+/-ssl_verify_server If set, then verify that the
servers certificate was issued by a CA in the file given by
the ssl_ca_file option. If the certificate s issuer cannot
be verified, do not connect to the server.</p>

<p>ssl_ca_file=CAFILE Specify the file containing the
certificate for the CA that issued the server s certificate.
If the server certificate is self-signed, CAFILE should
contain the certificate displayed by the Digital Certificate
Manager option Copy and paste certifi- cate.</p>

<p>ssl_cert_file=CERTFILE Specify the file containing the
personal certificate, in PEM format. This must be a
certificate associated with your user profile on the AS/400
by DCM.</p>

<p>ssl_pem_pass=PASSWORD If the personal certificate given
by ssl_cert_file is password protected, the password may be
given here to bypass the password prompt.</p>

<p>Display Options These options are specific to tn5250 and
xt5250.</p>

<p>+/-underscores Force or disable the use of underscore
characters instead of the underline attribute, for terminals
that do not support underlin- ing but where tn5250 does not
work this out itself.</p>

<p>+/-ruler Turn the ruler feature on or off. When enabled,
the row and column of the cursor will be highlighted.</p>

<p>env.TERM=MODEL Set the terminal model name for the
emulation session to use. The default depends on whether the
terminal supports colour, and whether it is large enough to
support the large terminal size. See Display Types below for
valid model names.</p>

<p>The default model emulated is an IBM-3179-2, a 24x80
colour ter- minal.</p>

<p>font_80=FONT If tn5250 is running in an xterm, sets the
font to change to when the terminal is in 80 column mode.
This should be a valid X font name, such as can be chosen
with xfontsel.</p>

<p>font_132=FONT If the emulated terminal has a size of
27x132, set the font to use in 132 column mode, as for the
font_80 option.</p>

<p>beep_command=COMMAND If present, will run the supplied
command instead of using the terminal beep.</p>

<p>+/-uninhibited If enabled, automatically resets the
input inhibited state when cursor movement keys or function
keys are pressed. The default is disabled.</p>

<p>env.VARIABLE=VALUE Set any other environment variables
controlling the terminal session. A list of relevant
variables is given in section 5 of RFC2877.</p>

<p>Printer Options outputcommand=COMMAND Set the command
that will be run to receive printer output. The default
command is scs2ascii |lpr.</p>

<p>env.IBMMFRTYPMDL=NAME Set the name of the host print
transform description to use on the AS/400. This is the same
as the MFRTYPMDL parameter on the CRTDEVPRT command. See the
CL Reference or the online help for a list of valid
values.</p>

<p>env.VARIABLE=VALUE Set any other environment variables
controlling the printer ses- sion. A list of relevant
variables is given in section 7 of RFC2877. More generally,
the variables are the parameters of the CRTDEVPRT command,
with a prefix of IBM.</p>

<p>OPTION VALUES Protocols The supported protocols for the
emulation session are listed below.</p>

<p>telnet Connect to the AS/400 using a normal unencrypted
telnet connec- tion. tn5250 is an alias for telnet.</p>

<p>ssl Connect securely using an encrypted SSL session.
This option is only available if tn5250 was compiled with
SSL support.</p>

<p>debug Instead of connecting to a server, replay the
trace generated by the trace option. The path to the trace
file should be given instead of the hostname.</p>

<p>Translation Maps CCSIDs on the AS/400 are listed in
Appendix G of IBM manual SC41-5101-01, AS/400 National
Language Support. This manual is avail- able on the web at
&lt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/book-
mgr/BOOKS/QB3AWC01/G.2&gt;.</p>

<p>Currently recognised values for the translation map are:
37, 256, 273, 277, 278, 280, 284, 285, 290, 297, 420, 424,
500, 870, 871, 875, 880, 905, and 1026. Most of these are
translated to ISO-8859-1, also known as Latin 1. Some of
them contain characters only present in another encoding,
which is used instead. The valid CCSID values, and the Unix
encoding used, are listed below.</p>

CCSIDs.</p>

a 132 column terminal, and printing underscore characters
instead of using underlines.</p>

and using the client certifi- cate in jbloggs.pem to sign on
automatically.</p>
