<p>NAME sealert - setroubleshoot client tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sealert [-b] [- [-h] [-s] [-S] [-l id] [-a
file] [-v] [-V] [-u] [-p]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the sealert
program.</p>

<p>sealert is the user interface component (either GUI or
command line) to the setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot
is used to diagnose SELinux denials and attempts to provide
user friendly explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC)
and recommendations for how one might adjust the system to
prevent the denial in the future.</p>

<p>In a standard configuration setroubleshoot is composed
of two compo- nents, setroubleshootd and sealert.</p>

<p>setroubleshootd is a system daemon which runs with root
privileges and listens for audit events emitted from the
kernel related to SELinux. When the setroubleshootd daemon
sees an SELinux AVC denial it runs a series of analysis
plugins which examines the audit data related to the AVC. It
records the results of the analysis and signals any clients
which have attached to the setroubleshootd daemon that a new
alert has been seen.</p>

<p>sealert can be run in either a GUI mode or a command
line mode. In both instances sealert run as a user process
with the privileges associated with the user. In GUI mode it
attaches to a setroubleshootd server instance and listens
for notifications of new alerts. By default the
setroubleshootd server instance is the one on the local
machine, how- ever one can connect via TCP to another server
instance on another machine. When a new alert arrives it
alerts the desktop user via a notification in the status
icon area. The user may then click on the alert notification
which will open an alert browser. In addition to the current
alert sealert communicates with the setroubleshootd daemon
to access all prior alerts stored in the setroubleshoot
database.</p>

<p>The user may elect to tag any given alert as being
&quot;silent&quot; in the browser which prevents any future
notification for the given alert. This is useful when a user
is already aware of a reoccurring problem. Alerts may be
deleted in the browser by selecting one or more alerts and
using the menu item to mark them for deletion. The marked
alerts are not actually deleted until the user selects the
command to delete all alerts marked for deletion. This is
analogous to many popular IMAP email clients. The user may
elect to hide in the browser alerts marked for deletion
and/or alerts which have been marked as silent, this helps
keep the browser less cluttered.</p>

<p>In addition to alerts provided by the setroubleshoot
daemon the &quot;Scan Logfile&quot; menu item provides the
user with the ability to scan a log file which may contain
audit messages, run the same analysis on the audit messages
as the setroubleshootd daemon would done and then browse the
alerts generated by the log file scan. The user may switch
back and forth between &quot;audit&quot; alerts from the
daemon and &quot;logfile&quot; alerts gen- erated by the
scan.</p>

<p>sealert may also be run in command line mode. The two
most useful com- mand line options are -l to
&quot;lookup&quot; an alert ID and -a to &quot;analyze&quot;
a log file. When setroubleshootd generates a new alert it
assigns it a local ID and writes this as a syslog message.
The -l lookup option may then be used to retrieve the alert
from the setroubleshootd alert database and write it to
stdout. This is most useful when setrou- bleshootd is being
run on a headless system without the GUI desktop alert
facility. The -a analyze option is equivalent to the
&quot;Scan Log- file&quot; command in the browser. The log
file is scanned for audit mes- sages, analysis is performed,
alerts generated, and then written to stdout. In both cases
the -H option can be used to cause the alert to be written
out in HTML format rather than the default plain text.</p>

<p>LOG FILE SCANNING You may ask sealert to parse a file
accumulating all the audit messages it finds in that file.
As each audit event is recognized it is pre- sented for
analysis which may generate an alert report if the analysis
was successful. If the same type of event is seen multiple
times resulting in the same report the results are coalesced
into a single report. The report count field will indicate
the number of times the tool thought it saw the same issue.
The report will also include a list of every line number on
which it found an audit record which con- tributed to the
coalesced report. This will allow you to coordinate the
contents of the file with the analysis results if need
be.</p>

<p>Log file scanning may be initiated from the sealert
browser via the File::ScanLogFile menu or from the command
line via sealert -a file- name. Please note that sealert
runs as a user level process with the permissions of the
user running it. Many system log files are readable by root
only. To work around this if you have root access one can
copy the file as root to a temporary file and change its
permissions. This is a good solution when scanning via the
GUI as a normal user. Or you might consider suing to root
and run the analysis via the command line (e.g. sealert -a
filename).</p>

<p>The audit records in the log file must be valid
syntactically correct audit messages or the parser will
ignore them.</p>

<p>If you use the GUI browser to scan a log file you should
be aware the browser can track and display alert reports
from two simultaneous sources, either the alerts from the
setroubleshootd server which is connected to the audit
system or the alert reports from a log file scan. The View
menu has entries which allow you to toggle between view- ing
the audit system reports and the scanned file reports.</p>
