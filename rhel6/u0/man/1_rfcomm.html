<p>NAME rfcomm - RFCOMM configuration utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rfcomm [ options ] &lt; command &gt; &lt; dev
&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rfcomm is used to set up, maintain, and
inspect the RFCOMM configura- tion of the Bluetooth
subsystem in the Linux kernel. If no command is given, or if
the option -a is used, rfcomm prints information about the
configured RFCOMM devices.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Gives a list of possible commands.</p>

<p>-a Prints information about all configured RFCOMM
devices.</p>

<p>-r Switch TTY into raw mode (doesnt work with
&quot;bind&quot;).</p>

<p>-f &lt;file&gt; Specify alternate config file.</p>

<p>-i &lt;hciX&gt; | &lt;bdaddr&gt; The command is applied
to device -A Enable authentication. -E Enable encryption. -S
Secure connection. -M Become the master of a piconet. hciX ,
which must be the name or the address of an installed
Bluetooth device. If not specified, the command will be use
the first available Bluetooth device.</p>

<p>-A Enable authentification</p>

<p>-E Enable encryption</p>

<p>-S Secure connection</p>

<p>-M Become the master of a piconet</p>

<p>-L &lt;seconds&gt; Set linger timeout</p>

<p>COMMANDS show &lt;dev&gt; Display the information about
the specified device.</p>

<p>connect &lt;dev&gt; [bdaddr] [channel] Connect the
RFCOMM device to the remote Bluetooth device on the
specified channel. If no channel is specified, it will use
the channel number 1. If also the Bluetooth address is left
out, it tries to read the data from the config file. This
command can be terminated with the key sequence CTRL-C.</p>

<p>listen &lt;dev&gt; [channel] [cmd] Listen on a specified
RFCOMM channel for incoming connections. If no channel is
specified, it will use the channel number 1, but a channel
must be specified before cmd. If cmd is given, it will be
executed as soon as a client connects. When the child
process terminates or the client disconnect, the command
will terminate. Occurences of {} in cmd will be replaced by
the name of the device used by the connection. This command
can be termi- nated with the key sequence CTRL-C.</p>

<p>watch &lt;dev&gt; [channel] [cmd] Watch is identical to
listen except that when the child process terminates or the
client disconnect, the command will restart listening with
the same parameters.</p>

<p>bind &lt;dev&gt; [bdaddr] [channel] This binds the
RFCOMM device to a remote Bluetooth device. The command did
not establish a connection to the remote device, it only
creates the binding. The connection will be established
right after an application tries to open the RFCOMM device.
If no channel number is specified, it uses the channel
number 1. If the Bluetooth address is also left out, it
tries to read the data from the config file.</p>

<p>If all is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all
devices that have bind yes set in the config will be
bound.</p>

<p>release &lt;dev&gt; This command releases a defined
RFCOMM binding.</p>

<p>If all is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all
bindings will be removed. This command didnt care about the
settings in the config file.</p>
