<p>WCTOMB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCTOMB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wctomb - convert a wide-character code to a
character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wctomb(char *s, wchar_t wchar);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wctomb() function shall determine the
number of bytes needed to represent the character
corresponding to the wide-character code whose value is
wchar (including any change in the shift state). It shall
store the character representation (possibly multiple bytes
and any special bytes to change shift state) in the array
object pointed to by s (if s is not a null pointer). At most
{MB_CUR_MAX} bytes shall be stored. If wchar is 0, a null
byte shall be stored, preceded by any shift sequence needed
to restore the initial shift state, and wctomb() shall be
left in the initial shift state.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a
state-dependent encoding, this function shall be placed into
its initial state by a call for which its character pointer
argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s as
other than a null pointer shall cause the internal state of
the func- tion to be altered as necessary. A call with s as
a null pointer shall cause this function to return a
non-zero value if encodings have state dependency, and 0
otherwise. Changing the LC_CTYPE category causes the shift
state of this function to be unspecified.</p>

<p>The wctomb() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
wctomb().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If s is a null pointer, wctomb() shall
return a non-zero or 0 value, if character encodings,
respectively, do or do not have state-dependent encodings.
If s is not a null pointer, wctomb() shall return -1 if the
value of wchar does not correspond to a valid character, or
return the number of bytes that constitute the character
corresponding to the value of wchar.</p>

<p>In no case shall the value returned be greater than the
value of the {MB_CUR_MAX} macro.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
