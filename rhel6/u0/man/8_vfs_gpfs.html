<p>NAME vfs_gpfs - gpfs specific samba extensions like acls
and prealloc</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = gpfs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The gpfs VFS module is the home for all gpfs extensions
that Samba requires for proper integration with GPFS. It
uses the GPL library interfaces provided by GPFS.</p>

<p>Currently the gpfs vfs module provides extensions in
following areas :</p>

<p>&middot; NFSv4 ACL Interfaces with configurable options
for GPFS</p>

<p>&middot; Kernel oplock support on GPFS</p>

<p>&middot; Lease support on GPFS</p>

<p>NOTE:This module follows the posix-acl behaviour and
hence allows permission stealing via chown. Samba might
allow at a later point in time, to restrict the chown via
this module as such restrictions are the responsibility of
the underlying filesystem than of Samba.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS nfs4:mode = [ simple | special ] Enable/Disable
substitution of special IDs on GPFS. This parameter should
not affect the windows users in anyway. It only ensures that
Samba sets the special IDs - OWNER@ and GROUP@ ( mappings to
simple uids ) that are relevant to GPFS.</p>

<p>The following MODEs are understood by the module:</p>

<p>&middot; simple(default) - do not use special IDs in
GPFS ACEs</p>

<p>&middot; special - use special IDs in GPFS ACEs.</p>

<p>nfs4:acedup = [dontcare|reject|ignore|merge] This
parameter configures how Samba handles duplicate ACEs
encountered in GPFS ACLs. GPFS allows/creates duplicate ACE
for different bits for same ID.</p>

<p>Following is the behaviour of Samba for different values
:</p>

<p>&middot; dontcare (default) - copy the ACEs as they
come</p>

<p>&middot; reject - stop operation and exit with error on
ACL set op</p>

<p>&middot; ignore - don&acute;t include the second
matching ACE</p>

<p>&middot; merge - bitwise OR the 2 ace.flag fields and 2
ace.mask fields of the 2 duplicate ACEs into 1 ACE</p>

<p>nfs4:chown = [yes|no] This parameter allows enabling or
disabling the chown supported by the underlying filesystem.
This parameter should be enabled with care as it might leave
your system insecure.</p>

<p>Some filesystems allow chown as a) giving b) stealing.
It is the latter that is considered a risk.</p>

<p>Following is the behaviour of Samba for different values
:</p>

<p>&middot; yes - Enable chown if as supported by the under
filesystem</p>

<p>&middot; no (default) - Disable chown</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A GPFS mount can be exported via Samba as
follows :</p>

<p>[samba_gpfs_share] vfs objects = gpfs path =
/test/gpfs_mount nfs4: mode = special nfs4: acedup =
merge</p>

<p>CAVEATS The gpfs gpl libraries are required by gpfs VFS
module during both compilation and runtime. Also this VFS
module is tested to work on SLES 9/10 and RHEL 4.4</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The GPFS VFS module was created with contributions from
Volker Lendecke and the developers at IBM.</p>

<p>This manpage was created by the IBM FSCC team</p>
