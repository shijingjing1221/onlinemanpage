<p>dcbtool(8) dcbtool(8)</p>

<p>NAME dcbtool - manage the Data Center Bridging (DCB)
settings of a DCB interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dcbtool -h dcbtool -v dcbtool [-rR] dcbtool
[-rR] [command] [command arguments]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dcbtool is used to query and set the DCB
settings of a DCB capable Eth- ernet interface. It connects
to the client interface of lldpad to per- form these
operations. dcbtool will operate in interactive mode if it
is executed without a command. In interactive mode, dcbtool
also func- tions as an event listener and will print out
events received from lld- pad as they arrive.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h show the dcbtool usage message</p>

<p>-v shows dcbtool version information</p>

<p>-r display the raw lldpad client interface messages as
well as the readable output.</p>

<p>-R display only the raw lldpad client interface
messages</p>

<p>COMMANDS help shows the dcbtool usage message</p>

<p>ping test command. lldpad responds with
&quot;PPONG&quot; if the client inter- face is
operational.</p>

<p>license displays dcbtool license information</p>

<p>quit exit from interactive mode</p>

<p>The following commands interact with lldpad to manage
the daemon and DCB features on DCB capable interfaces.</p>

<p>dcbtool general configuration commands:</p>

<p>&lt;gc|go&gt; dcbx get the configured or operational
version of the DCB capabili- ties exchange protocol. If
different, the configured version will take effect (and
become the operational version) after lld- pad is
restarted.</p>

<p>sc dcbx v:[1|2] set the version of the DCB capabilities
exchange protocol which will be used the next time lldpad is
started. Information about version 1 can be found at:
&lt;http://download.intel.com/technology/eedc/dcb_cep_spec.pdf&gt;
Information about version 2 can be found at:
&lt;http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2008/az-wadekar-dcbx-
capability-exchange-discovery-protocol-1108-v1.01.pdf&gt;</p>

<p>DCB per-interface commands:</p>

<p>gc &lt;ifname&gt; &lt;feature&gt; get configuration of
feature on interface ifname.</p>

<p>go &lt;ifname&gt; &lt;feature&gt; get operational status
of feature on interface ifname.</p>

<p>gp &lt;ifname&gt; &lt;feature&gt; get peer configuration
of feature on interface ifname.</p>

<p>sc &lt;ifname&gt; &lt;feature&gt; &lt;args&gt; set the
configuration of feature on interface ifname.</p>

<p>feature may be one of the following:</p>

<p>dcb DCB state of the port</p>

<p>pg priority groups</p>

<p>pfc priority flow control</p>

<p>app:&lt;subtype&gt; application specific data</p>

<p>ll:&lt;subtype&gt; logical link status</p>

<p>subtype can be:</p>

<p>0|fcoe Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)</p>

<p>args can include:</p>

<p>e:&lt;0|1&gt; controls feature enable</p>

<p>a:&lt;0|1&gt; controls whether the feature is advertised
via DCBX to the peer</p>

<p>w:&lt;0|1&gt; controls whether the feature is willing to
change its opera- tional configuration based on what is
received from the peer</p>

<p>[feature specific args] arguments specific to a DCB
feature</p>

<p>Feature specific arguments for dcb:</p>

<p>on|off enable or disable DCB for the interface. The go
and gp commands are not needed for the dcb feature. Also,
the enable(e), adver- tise(a) and willing(w) arguments are
not required.</p>

<p>Feature specific arguments for pg:</p>

<p>pgid:xxxxxxxx Priority group ID for the 8 priorities.
From left to right (priorities 0-7), x is the corresponding
priority group ID value, which can be 0-7 for priority
groups with bandwidth allo- cations or f (priority group ID
15) for the unrestricted prior- ity group.</p>

<p>pgpct:x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x Priority group percentage of link
bandwidth. From left to right (priority groups 0-7), x is
the percentage of link bandwidth allocated to the
corresponding priority group. The total band- width must
equal 100%.</p>

<p>uppct:x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x Priority percentage of priority
group bandwidth. From left to right (priorities 0-7), x is
the percentage of priority group bandwidth allocated to the
corresponding priority. The sum of percentages for
priorities which belong to the same priority group must
total 100% (except for priority group 15).</p>

<p>strict:xxxxxxxx Strict priority setting. From left to
right (priorities 0-7), x is 0 or 1. 1 indicates that the
priority may utilize all of the bandwidth allocated to its
priority group.</p>

<p>up2tc:xxxxxxxx Priority to traffic class mapping. From
left to right (priori- ties 0-7), x is the traffic class
(0-7) to which the priority is mapped.</p>

<p>Feature specific arguments for pfc:</p>

<p>pfcup:xxxxxxxx Enable/disable priority flow control.
From left to right (pri- orities 0-7), x is 0 or 1. 1
indicates that the corresponding priority is configured to
transmit priority pause.</p>

<p>Feature specific arguments for app:&lt;subtype&gt;:</p>

<p>appcfg:xx xx is a hexadecimal value representing an 8
bit bitmap where 1 bits indicate the priorities which frames
for the applications specified by subtype should use. The
lowest order bit maps to priority 0.</p>

<p>Feature specific arguments for ll:&lt;subtype&gt;:</p>

<p>status:[0|1] For testing purposes, the logical link
status may be set to 0 or 1. This setting is not persisted
in the configuration file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Enable DCB on interface eth2</p>

<p>dcbtool sc eth2 dcb on</p>

<p>Assign priorites 0-3 to priority group 0, priorites 4-6
to priority group 1 and priority 7 to the unrestricted
priority. Also, allocate 25% of link bandwidth to priority
group 0 and 75% to group 1.</p>

<p>dcbtool sc eth2 pg pgid:0000111f
pgpct:25,75,0,0,0,0,0,0</p>

<p>Enable transmit of Priority Flow Control for priority 3
and assign FCoE to priority 3.</p>

<p>dcbtool sc eth2 pfc pfcup:00010000 dcbtool sc eth2 app:0
appcfg:08</p>
