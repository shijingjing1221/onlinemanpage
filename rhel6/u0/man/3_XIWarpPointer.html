<p>XIWARPPOINTER(3) [FIXME: manual] XIWARPPOINTER(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIWarpPointer - move a device&acute;s pointer.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>Bool XIWarpPointer( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window src_w, Window dest_w, double src_x, double src_y, int
src_width, int src_height, double dest_x, double
dest_y);</p>

<p>dest_w Specifies the destination window or None.</p>

<p>dest_x, dest_y Specify the x and y coordinates within
the destination window.</p>

<p>deviceid Specifies the master pointer device or floating
slave device to move.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>src_x, src_y, src_width, src_height Specify a rectangle
in the source window.</p>

<p>src_w Specifies the source window or None.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If dest_w is None, XIWarpPointer moves the
pointer by the offsets (dest_x, dest_y) relative to the
current position of the pointer. If dest_w is a window,
XIWarpPointer moves the pointer to the offsets (dest_x,
dest_y) relative to the origin of dest_w. However, if src_w
is a window, the move only takes place if the window src_w
contains the pointer and if the specified rectangle of src_w
contains the pointer.</p>

<p>The src_x and src_y coordinates are relative to the
origin of src_w. If src_height is zero, it is replaced with
the current height of src_w minus src_y. If src_width is
zero, it is replaced with the current width of src_w minus
src_x.</p>

<p>There is seldom any reason for calling this function.
The pointer should normally be left to the user. If you do
use this function, however, it generates events just as if
the user had instantaneously moved the pointer from one
position to another. Note that you cannot use XIWarpPointer
to move the pointer outside the confine_to window of an
active pointer grab. An attempt to do so will only move the
pointer as far as the closest edge of the confine_to
window.</p>

<p>XIWarpPointer is identical to XWarpPointer but specifies
the device explicitly.</p>

<p>XIWarpPointer can generate a BadDevice and a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The device does not exist or is not a pointer device.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined window.</p>
