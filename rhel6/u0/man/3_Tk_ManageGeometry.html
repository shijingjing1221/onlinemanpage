<p>Tk_ManageGeometry(3) Tk Library Procedures

<p>NAME Tk_ManageGeometry - arrange to handle geometry
requests for a window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_ManageGeometry(tkwin, mgrPtr, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window to be
man- aged.</p>

<p>const Tk_GeomMgr *mgrPtr (in) Pointer to data structure
con- taining information about the geometry manager, or NULL
to indicate that tkwins geometry should not be managed
anymore. The data structure pointed to by mgrPtr must be
static: Tk keeps a reference to it as long as the window is
managed.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to geometry manager call- backs.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_ManageGeometry arranges for a particular
geometry manager, described by the mgrPtr argument, to
control the geometry of a particular slave window, given by
tkwin. If tkwin was previously managed by some other
geometry manager, the previous manager loses control in
favor of the new one. If mgrPtr is NULL, geometry management
is cancelled for tkwin.</p>

<p>The structure pointed to by mgrPtr contains information
about the geom- etry manager: typedef struct { const char
*name; Tk_GeomRequestProc *requestProc; Tk_GeomLostSlaveProc
*lostSlaveProc; } Tk_GeomMgr; The name field is the textual
name for the geometry manager, such as pack or place; this
value will be returned by the command winfo man- ager.</p>

<p>requestProc is a procedure in the geometry manager that
will be invoked whenever Tk_GeometryRequest is called by the
slave to change its desired geometry. requestProc should
have arguments and results that match the type
Tk_GeomRequestProc: typedef void Tk_GeomRequestProc(
ClientData clientData, Tk_Window tkwin); The parameters to
requestProc will be identical to the corresponding
parameters passed to Tk_ManageGeometry. clientData usually
points to a data structure containing application-specific
information about how to manage tkwins geometry.</p>

<p>The lostSlaveProc field of mgrPtr points to another
procedure in the geometry manager. Tk will invoke
lostSlaveProc if some other manager calls Tk_ManageGeometry
to claim tkwin away from the current geometry manager.
lostSlaveProc is not invoked if Tk_ManageGeometry is called
with a NULL value for mgrPtr (presumably the current
geometry manager has made this call, so it already knows
that the window is no longer managed), nor is it called if
mgrPtr is the same as the windows cur- rent geometry
manager. lostSlaveProc should have arguments and results
that match the following prototype: typedef void
Tk_GeomLostSlaveProc( ClientData clientData, Tk_Window
tkwin); The parameters to lostSlaveProc will be identical to
the corresponding parameters passed to
Tk_ManageGeometry.</p>
