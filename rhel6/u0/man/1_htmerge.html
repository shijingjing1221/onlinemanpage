<p>NAME htmerge - create document index and word database
for the ht://Dig search engine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htmerge [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htmerge is used to create a document index
and word database from the files that were created by htdig.
These databases are then used by htsearch to perform the
actual searched.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to
append .work to database files, causing a second copy of the
database to be built. This allows the original files to be
used by htsearch during the indexing run.</p>

<p>-c configfile Use the specified configfile instead of
the default.</p>

<p>-d Prevent the document index from being created.</p>

<p>-s Print statistics about the document and word
databases after htmerge has finished.</p>

<p>-v Run in verbose mode. This will provide some hints as
to the progress of the merge. This can be useful when
running htmerge interactively since some parts (especially
the word database creation) can take a very long time.</p>

<p>-w Prevent the word database from being created.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TMPDIR In addition to the command line
options, the environment vari- able TMPDIR will be used to
designate the directory where inter- mediate files are
stored during the sorting process.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration
file.</p>
