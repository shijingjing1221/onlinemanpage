<p>NAME ppmdraw - draw lines, text, etc on a PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmdraw</p>

<p>{ -script=script | -scriptfile=filename } [-verbose]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmdraw draws lines, shapes, text, etc. on a PPM image.
It is essen- tially an easy-to-program front end to
libnetpbm s ppmd subroutines. It lets you create a
human-friendly script to describe the drawing rather than
write a C program.</p>

<p>You supply drawing instructions with a script, which you
supply either in a file named by a -scriptfile option or as
the value of a -script option. Here is an example
script:</p>

<p>setpos 50 50; text_here 10 30 hello; setcolor black;
text_here 10 0 there; line_here 5 20;</p>

<p>This example starts at Column 50, Row 50 of the input
image and writes the word hello there in 10 pixel high white
letters at a 30 degree angle up from horizontal. Then, from
where that leaves off, the script writes there in 10 pixel
high black letters horizontally. Finally, it draws a black
line to a point 5 pixels over and 20 pixels down from the
end of there.</p>

<p>If you dont specify ppmfile, ppmdraw reads its input PPM
image from Standard Input.</p>

<p>The output image goes to Standard Output.</p>

<p>ppmdraw works on multi-image streams. It executes the
same script on each input image and produces an output
stream with one image for each input image. But before
Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), ppmdraw ignored every image
after the first.</p>

<p>If you just want to add a single line of text to an
image, ppmlabel may be more what you want.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -script=script This option gives the script. See
Script .</p>

<p>You may not specify both -script and -scriptfile.</p>

<p>-scriptfile=filename This option names a file that
contains the script. - means Standard Input.</p>

<p>You may not specify both -script and -scriptfile.</p>

<p>You may not specify - (Standard Input) for both
-scriptfile and the input image file.</p>

<p>SCRIPT The heart of ppmdraw function is its script. The
script is a character stream. The stream consists of
commands. Commands are separated by semicolons. White space
is regarded just like in C: Any contiguous stretch of
unquoted white space is equivalent to a single space charac-
ter. Note that this means newlines have no particular
significance.</p>

<p>A command is composed of tokens, separated from each
other by white space. To write a token that contains white
space, enclose it in dou- ble quotes. Everything between two
matched quotation marks is one token.</p>

<p>The first token of a command is the verb, which
determines the basic function of the command. The rest of
the tokens of the command are arguments, the meaning of
which depends upon the verb. The following list gives all
the valid verbs, and for each its meaning and its argu-
ments.</p>

<p>Many command have arguments that specify a position on
the canvas, which you specify by row and column. Row 0 is
the top row. Column 0 is the leftmost column. You may
specify negative numbers (but such a position would
necessarily be off the canvas).</p>

<p>Your drawing instructions may involve positions not on
the canvas. But any pixels you draw there just get
discarded.</p>

<p>setpos Set the current position in the image. This
affects where subsequent commands draw things. The 2
arguments are the column and row number.</p>

<p>At the start of the script, the current position is
(0,0).</p>

<p>setlinetype The 1 argument is normal or nodiag.. This
effects a ppmd_setlinetype() call. Further details are not
yet docu- mented.</p>

<p>setlineclip This effects a ppmd_setlineclip() call. Not
yet documented.</p>

<p>setcolor This sets the current color, which determines
the color in which subsequent drawing commands draw. Before
the first set- color, the current color is white.</p>

<p>setfont This sets the current font, which determines the
font in which subsequent text drawing commands draw. Before
the first set- font, the current color is a built in font
called standard.</p>

<p>The argument of this command is a file name. It is the
name of a Netpbm PPMD font file.</p>

<p>A Netpbm PPMD font file typically has a name that ends
in .ppmdfont and its first 8 bytes are the ASCII encoding of
ppmdfont.</p>

<p>There is only one of these fonts as far as we know. It
is dis- tributed with Netpbm as the file standard.ppmdfont,
but you dont need to use that file because the same font is
built into the Netpbm library and is the default. If you
want to make a new font, you can find the format of a
ppmdfont file in the Netpbm interface header file
ppmdfont.h, but youll have to make your own tools to build
it.</p>

<p>line This draws a one pixel wide line in the current
color. The 4 arguments are: starting column, starting row,
ending column, ending row.</p>

<p>This command does not affect the current position.</p>

<p>line_here This is like line, except it works in a more
relative way.</p>

<p>The line starts at the current point. The two arguments
are the rightward and downard displacement from there of the
terminal point. The command moves the current position to
the terminal point after drawing.</p>

<p>spline3 This draws a spline in the current color between
2 points, using a third as a control point. It approximates
a cubic spline seg- ment.</p>

<p>The shape of the curve is such that it passes through
the speci- fied endpoints, and lines tangent to the curve at
those end- points intersect at the control point.
Controlling the tangents allows you to connect this curve to
other curves generated the same way without having corners
at the connection points.</p>

<p>The 6 arguments are the starting point column, starting
point row, control point column, control point row, ending
point col- umn, and ending point row.</p>

<p>This command does not affect the current position.</p>

<p>circle This command draws a circle in the current color.
The three arguments are the column number and row number of
the center of the circle and the radius of the circle in
pixels.</p>

<p>filledrectangle This command draws a rectangle filled
with the current color.</p>

<p>The 4 arguments are the column and row numbers of the
upper left corner of the rectangle, the width of the
rectangle, and the height of the rectangle.</p>

<p>text This command draws text in the current color in the
built-in font. The 5 arguments are:</p>

<p>&middot; column number of starting point of baseline</p>

<p>&middot; row number of starting point of baseline</p>

<p>&middot; height of characters, in pixels</p>

<p>&middot; angle of baseline in degrees elevated from the
horizontal</p>

<p>&middot; text</p>

<p>Note that if your text contains white space, youll have
to use double quotes to cause it to be a single token.</p>

<p>text_here This is like text, except that the baseline
starts at the cur- rent position and the command updates the
current position to the other end of the baseline after it
draws.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that a script starts with the current
position in the top line, so if you leave it there, only the
bottom line of your text will be within the image!</p>
