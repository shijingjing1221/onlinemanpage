<p>IPSEC_IKEPING(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_IKEPING(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_ikeping - send/receive ISAKMP/IKE echo
requests/replies</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec ikeping [--listen] [--verbose] [--wait
time] [--exchangenum num] [--ikeport localport]
[--ikeaddress address] [--inet] [--inet6] destaddr
[/dstport...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ikeping sends and receives ISAKMP/IKE echo
request and echo reply packets. These packets are intended
for diagnostics purposes, in a manner similar to ping(8)
does for ICMP echo request/reply packets.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, the ISAKMP echo
request/reply exchange is still an internet-draft
(draft-richardson-ipsec-ikeping-00), and is therefore
completely non-standard. The Openswan IKE daemon pluto does
implement this draft, so ikeping can be used to test
connectivity to an openswan ipsec server.</p>

<p>Ikeping will bind to the local address given by
--ikeaddress and the port number given by --ikeport
defaulting to the wildcard address and the ISAKMP port 500.
An ISAKMP exchange of type 244 (a private use number) is
sent to each of the address/ports listed on the command
line. The exchange number may be overridden by the
--exchangenum option.</p>

<p>Ikeping then listens for replies, printing them as they
are received. Replies are of exchange type 245 or the
specified exchange number plus 1. Ikeping will keep
listening until it either receives as many echo responses as
it sent, or until the timeout period (5 seconds) has been
reached. Receipt of a packet will reset the timer. The
--wait option can be used to specify a different timeout
period.</p>

<p>If the --listen option is given, then ikeping will not
send any packets. Instead, it will listen for them and reply
to each request received.</p>

<p>If the --natt option is given, then ikeping will set the
socket to permit UDP encapsulated ESP packets. This is only
useful in listen mode.</p>
