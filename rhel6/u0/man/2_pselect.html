<p>pselect(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION select() and pselect() allow a program to
monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more
of the file descriptors become &quot;ready&quot; for some
class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible). A file
descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform
the corre- sponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2)) without
blocking.</p>

<p>The operation of select() and pselect() is identical,
with three dif- ferences:</p>

<p>(i) select() uses a timeout that is a struct timeval
(with seconds and microseconds), while pselect() uses a
struct timespec (with seconds and nanoseconds).</p>

<p>(ii) select() may update the timeout argument to
indicate how much time was left. pselect() does not change
this argument.</p>

<p>(iii) select() has no sigmask argument, and behaves as
pselect() called with NULL sigmask.</p>

<p>Three independent sets of file descriptors are watched.
Those listed in readfds will be watched to see if characters
become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a
read will not block; in particu- lar, a file descriptor is
also ready on end-of-file), those in writefds will be
watched to see if a write will not block, and those in
exceptfds will be watched for exceptions. On exit, the sets
are modi- fied in place to indicate which file descriptors
actually changed sta- tus. Each of the three file descriptor
sets may be specified as NULL if no file descriptors are to
be watched for the corresponding class of events.</p>

<p>Four macros are provided to manipulate the sets.
FD_ZERO() clears a set. FD_SET() and FD_CLR() respectively
add and remove a given file descriptor from a set.
FD_ISSET() tests to see if a file descriptor is part of the
set; this is useful after select() returns.</p>

<p>nfds is the highest-numbered file descriptor in any of
the three sets, plus 1.</p>

<p>timeout is an upper bound on the amount of time elapsed
before select() returns. If both fields of the timeval
stucture are zero, then select() returns immediately. (This
is useful for polling.) If time- out is NULL (no timeout),
select() can block indefinitely.</p>

<p>sigmask is a pointer to a signal mask (see
sigprocmask(2)); if it is not NULL, then pselect() first
replaces the current signal mask by the one pointed to by
sigmask, then does the &quot;select&quot; function, and then
restores the original signal mask.</p>

<p>Other than the difference in the precision of the
timeout argument, the following pselect() call:</p>

<p>ready = pselect(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds,
&amp;exceptfds, timeout, &amp;sigmask);</p>

<p>is equivalent to atomically executing the following
calls:</p>

<p>sigset_t origmask;</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
ready = select(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds,
&amp;exceptfds, timeout); sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK,
&amp;origmask, NULL);</p>

<p>The reason that pselect() is needed is that if one wants
to wait for either a signal or for a file descriptor to
become ready, then an atomic test is needed to prevent race
conditions. (Suppose the signal handler sets a global flag
and returns. Then a test of this global flag followed by a
call of select() could hang indefinitely if the sig- nal
arrived just after the test but just before the call. By
contrast, pselect() allows one to first block signals,
handle the signals that have come in, then call pselect()
with the desired sigmask, avoiding the race.)</p>

<p>The timeout The time structures involved are defined in
&lt;sys/time.h&gt; and look like</p>

<p>struct timeval { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_usec; /* microseconds */ };</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>struct timespec { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>(However, see below on the POSIX.1-2001 versions.)</p>

<p>Some code calls select() with all three sets empty, nfds
zero, and a non-NULL timeout as a fairly portable way to
sleep with subsecond pre- cision.</p>

<p>On Linux, select() modifies timeout to reflect the
amount of time not slept; most other implementations do not
do this. (POSIX.1-2001 per- mits either behavior.) This
causes problems both when Linux code which reads timeout is
ported to other operating systems, and when code is ported
to Linux that reuses a struct timeval for multiple select()s
in a loop without reinitializing it. Consider timeout to be
undefined after select() returns.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, select() and pselect() return
the number of file descrip- tors contained in the three
returned descriptor sets (that is, the total number of bits
that are set in readfds, writefds, exceptfds) which may be
zero if the timeout expires before anything interesting
happens. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately; the sets and timeout become undefined, so do
not rely on their contents after an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF An invalid file descriptor was given in one
of the sets. (Per- haps a file descriptor that was already
closed, or one on which an error has occurred.)</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL nfds is negative or the value contained within
timeout is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOMEM unable to allocate memory for internal
tables.</p>

<p>VERSIONS pselect() was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.
Prior to this, pse- lect() was emulated in glibc (but see
BUGS).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO select() conforms to POSIX.1-2001 and
4.4BSD (select() first appeared in 4.2BSD). Generally
portable to/from non-BSD systems supporting clones of the
BSD socket layer (including System V variants). However,
note that the System V variant typically sets the timeout
variable before exit, but the BSD variant does not.</p>

<p>pselect() is defined in POSIX.1g, and in
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES An fd_set is a fixed size buffer. Executing
FD_CLR() or FD_SET() with a value of fd that is negative or
is equal to or larger than FD_SETSIZE will result in
undefined behavior. Moreover, POSIX requires fd to be a
valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>Concerning the types involved, the classical situation
is that the two fields of a timeval structure are typed as
long (as shown above), and the structure is defined in
&lt;sys/time.h&gt;. The POSIX.1-2001 situation is</p>

<p>struct timeval { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */
suseconds_t tv_usec; /* microseconds */ };</p>

<p>where the structure is defined in &lt;sys/select.h&gt;
and the data types time_t and suseconds_t are defined in
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Concerning prototypes, the classical situation is that
one should include &lt;time.h&gt; for select(). The
POSIX.1-2001 situation is that one should include
&lt;sys/select.h&gt; for select() and pselect().</p>

<p>Libc4 and libc5 do not have a &lt;sys/select.h&gt;
header; under glibc 2.0 and later this header exists. Under
glibc 2.0 it unconditionally gives the wrong prototype for
pselect(). Under glibc 2.1 to 2.2.1 it gives pselect() when
_GNU_SOURCE is defined. Since glibc 2.2.2 the requirements
are as shown in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p>Linux Notes The Linux pselect() system call modifies its
timeout argument. How- ever, the glibc wrapper function
hides this behavior by using a local variable for the
timeout argument that is passed to the system call. Thus,
the glibc pselect() function does not modify its timeout
argu- ment; this is the behavior required by
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS Glibc 2.0 provided a version of pselect() that did
not take a sigmask argument.</p>

<p>Since version 2.1, glibc has provided an emulation of
pselect() that is implemented using sigprocmask(2) and
select(). This implementation remains vulnerable to the very
race condition that pselect() was designed to prevent. On
systems that lack pselect(), reliable (and more portable)
signal trapping can be achieved using the self-pipe trick
(where a signal handler writes a byte to a pipe whose other
end is monitored by select() in the main program.)</p>

<p>Under Linux, select() may report a socket file
descriptor as &quot;ready for reading&quot;, while
nevertheless a subsequent read blocks. This could for
example happen when data has arrived but upon examination
has wrong checksum and is discarded. There may be other
circumstances in which a file descriptor is spuriously
reported as ready. Thus it may be safer to use O_NONBLOCK on
sockets that should not block.</p>

<p>On Linux, select() also modifies timeout if the call is
interrupted by a signal handler (i.e., the EINTR error
return). This is not permitted by POSIX.1-2001. The Linux
pselect() system call has the same behav- ior, but the glibc
wrapper hides this behavior by internally copying the
timeout to a local variable and passing that variable to the
system call.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { fd_set rfds; struct timeval tv; int
retval;</p>

<p>/* Watch stdin (fd 0) to see when it has input. */
FD_ZERO(&amp;rfds); FD_SET(0, &amp;rfds);</p>

<p>/* Wait up to five seconds. */ tv.tv_sec = 5; tv.tv_usec
= 0;</p>

<p>retval = select(1, &amp;rfds, NULL, NULL, &amp;tv); /*
Dont rely on the value of tv now! */</p>

<p>if (retval == -1) perror(&quot;select()&quot;); else if
(retval) printf(&quot;Data is available now.0); /*
FD_ISSET(0, &amp;rfds) will be true. */ else printf(&quot;No
data within five seconds.0);</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
