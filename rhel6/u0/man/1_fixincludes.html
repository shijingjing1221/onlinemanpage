<p>NAME fixincludes - Reduce the number of #includes in KDE
source files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fixincludes [-v, --verbose] [-e,
--experimental] [-m, --modify] [file] [--help]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fixincludes tries to reduce the number of
#includes in C++ source files. Much of it s processing is
specific to KDE sources and so it might not work so well
with sources for non-KDE applications.</p>

<p>The following problems are identified by
fixincludes:</p>

<p>&middot; Including headers that are no longer supported
but which exist for compatibility with older Qt/KDE
versions;</p>

<p>&middot; Including the same file multiple times.</p>

<p>There is also an experimental mode which tries removing
each #include one at a time (with a few exceptions) to see
whether the source still compiles. Note that this
experimental mode will modify the original sources.</p>

<p>By default the sources will not be modified; the
identified problems will simply be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>The list of C++ sources to examine should be given on
the command-line. If no files are given, all C++ sources in
or beneath the current direc- tory will be examined (with
the exception of directories whose Make- file.am contains
-UQT_NO_COMPAT or -UKDE_NO_COMPAT)</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v, --verbose Verbose mode. Additional debugging
output is written to standard output.</p>

<p>-e, --experimental Experimental mode, as described above
in detail. Note that this option implies --modify.</p>

<p>-m, --modify As well as writing messages to standard
output, actually modify the original sources to fix any
problems that were found.</p>
