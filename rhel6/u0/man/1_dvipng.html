<p>NAME dvipng - A DVI-to-PNG translator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dvipng [options] filename</p>

<p>dvipng [options] [filename] -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics
from DVI files as obtained from TeX and its relatives.</p>

<p>If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using
the dvigif binary or with the --gif option.</p>

<p>The benefits of dvipng/dvigif include</p>

<p>&middot; Speed. It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code
for DVI files, which makes it suitable for generating large
amounts of images on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex,
WeBWorK and others.</p>

<p>&middot; It does not read the postamble, so it can be
started before TeX finishes. There is a --follow switch that
makes dvipng wait at end- of-file for further output, unless
it finds the POST marker that indicates the end of the
DVI.</p>

<p>&middot; Interactive query of options. dvipng can read
options interactively through stdin, and all options are
usable. It is even possible to change the input file through
this interface.</p>

<p>&middot; Supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType
fonts, subfonts (i.e., as used in CJK-LaTeX), color
specials, and inclusion of PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF
images.</p>

<p>&middot; and more...</p>

<p>OPTIONS Many of the parameterless options listed here
can be turned off by suf- fixing the option with a zero (0);
for instance, to turn off page reversal, use -r0. Such
options are marked with a trailing *.</p>

<p>- Read additional options from standard input after
processing the command line.</p>

<p>--help Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p>-bd num -bd color_spec -bdnum color_spec Set the pixel
width of the transparent border (default 0). Using this
option will make the image edges transparent, but it only
affects pixels with the background color. Giving a
color_spec will set the fallback color, to be used in
viewers that cannot handle transparency (the default is the
background color). The color spec should be in TeX color
cial syntax, e.g., rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0. Setting the fallback
color makes the default border width 1 px.</p>

<p>--bdpi num Set the base (Metafont) resolution, both
horizontal and vertical, to num dpi (dots per inch). This
option is necessary when manually selecting Metafont mode
with the --mode option (see below).</p>

<p>-bg color_spec Choose background color for the images.
This option will be ignored if there is a background color
cial in the DVI. The color spec should be in TeX color cial
syntax, e.g., rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0. You can also specify
Transparent or transparent which will give you a transparent
background with the normal background as a fall- back color.
A capitalized Transparent will give a full-alpha
transparency, while an all-lowercase transparent will give a
sim- ple fully transparent background with non-transparent
antialiased pixels. The latter would be suitable for viewers
who cannot cope with a true alpha channel. GIF images do not
support full alpha transparency, so in case of GIF output,
both variants will use the latter behaviour.</p>

<p>-d num Set the debug flags, showing what dvipng (thinks
it) is doing. This will work unless dvipng has been compiled
without the &quot;DEBUG&quot; option (not recommended). Set
the flags as you need them, use -d -1 as the first option
for maximum output.</p>

<p>-D num Set the output resolution, both horizontal and
vertical, to num dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>One may want to adjust this to fit a certain text font
size (e.g., on a web page), and for a text font height of
font_px pixels (in Mozilla) the correct formula is</p>

<p>&lt;dpi&gt; = &lt;font_px&gt; * 72.27 / 10 [px *
TeXpt/in / TeXpt]</p>

<p>The last division by ten is due to the standard font
height 10pt in your document, if you use 12pt, divide by 12.
Unfortunately, some proprietary browsers have font height in
pt (points), not pixels. You have to rescale that to pixels,
using the screen resolution (default is usually 96 dpi)
which means the formula is</p>

<p>&lt;font_px&gt; = &lt;font_pt&gt; * 96 / 72 [pt * px/in
/ (pt/in)]</p>

<p>On some high-res screens, the value is instead 120 dpi.
Good luck!</p>

<p>--depth* Report the depth of the image. This only works
reliably when the LaTeX style preview.sty from preview-latex
is used with the active option. It reports the number of
pixels from the bottom of the image to the baseline of the
image. This can be used for vertical positioning of the
image in, e.g., web documents, where one would use
(Cascading StyleSheets 1)</p>

<p>&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;&lt;filename.png&gt;&quot;
STYLE=&quot;vertical-align: -&lt;depth&gt;px&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>The depth is a negative offset in this case, so the
minus sign is necessary, and the unit is pixels (px).</p>

<p>--dvinum* Set this option to make the output page number
be the TeX page num- bers rather than the physical page
number. See the -o switch.</p>

<p>-fg color_spec Choose foreground color for the images.
This option will be ignored if there is a foreground color
cial in the DVI. The color spec should be in TeX color cial
syntax, e.g., rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0.</p>

<p>--follow* Wait for data at end-of-file. One of the
benefits of dvipng is that it does not read the postamble,
so it can be started before TeX finishes. This switch makes
dvipng wait at end-of-file for further output, unless it
finds the POST marker that indicates the end of the DVI.
This is similar to tail -f but for DVI-to-PNG
conversion.</p>

<p>--freetype* Enable/disable FreeType font rendering
(default on). This option is available if the FreeType2 font
library was present at compilation time. If this is the
case, dvipng will have direct support for PostScript Type1
and TrueType fonts internally, rather than using gsftopk for
rendering the fonts. If you have PostScript versions of
Computer Modern installed, there will be no need to generate
bitmapped variants on disk of these. Then, you can render
images at different (and unusual) resolutions without
cluttering the disk with lots of bitmapped fonts. Note that
if you have both FreeType and T1lib on your system, FreeType
will be preferred by dvipng. If you for some reason would
want to use T1lib rendering, use this option.</p>

<p>--gamma num Control the interpolation of colors in the
greyscale anti-aliasing color palette. Default value is 1.0.
For 0 &lt; num &lt; 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like
the background), and for num &gt; 1, the fonts will be
darker (more like the foreground).</p>

<p>--gif* The images are output in the GIF format, if GIF
support is enabled. This is the default for the dvigif
binary, which only will be available when GIF support is
enabled. GIF images are palette images (see the --palette
option) and does not support true alpha channels (see the
--bg option). See also the --png option.</p>

<p>--height* Report the height of the image. This only
works reliably when the LaTeX style preview.sty from
preview-latex is used with the active option. It reports the
number of pixels from the top of the image to the baseline
of the image. The total height of the image is obtained as
the sum of the values reported from --height and
--depth.</p>

<p>-l [=]num The last page printed will be the first one
numbered num. Default is the last page in the document. If
num is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and the argument
to the -p option, if specified) is treated as a physical
(absolute) page number, rather than a value to compare with
the TeX Thus, using -l =9 will end with the ninth page of
the document, no matter what the pages are actually
numbered.</p>

<p>--mode mode Use mode as the Metafont device name for the
PK fonts (both for path searching and font generation). This
needs to be augmented with the base device resolution, given
with the --bdpi option. See the file
&lt;ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf&gt; for a list of
resolutions and mode names for most devices.</p>

<p>-M* Turns off automatic PK font generation (mktexpk).
This will have no effect when using PostScript fonts, since
no PK font generation will be done anyway.</p>

<p>--noghostscript* This switch prohibits the internal call
to GhostScript for display- ing PostScript specials.
--noghostscript0 turns the call back on.</p>

<p>--nogssafer* Normally, if GhostScript is used to render
PostScript specials, the GhostScript interpreter is run with
the option -dSAFER. The --nogssafer option runs GhostScript
without -dSAFER. The -dSAFER option in Ghostscript disables
PostScript operators such as delete- file, to prevent
possibly malicious PostScript programs from having any
effect.</p>

<p>-o name Send output to the file name. A single
occurrence of %d or %01d, ..., %09d will be exchanged for
the physical page number (this can be changed, see the
--dvinum switch). The default output filename is file%d.png
where the input DVI file was file.dvi.</p>

<p>-O x-offset,y-offset Move the origin by
x-offset,y-offset, a comma-separated pair of dimensions such
as .1in,-.3cm. The origin of the page is shifted from the
default position (of one inch down, one inch to the right
from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.</p>

<p>-p [=]num The first page printed will be the first one
numbered num. Default is the first page in the document. If
num is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and the argument
to the -l option, if specified) is treated as a physical
(absolute) page number, rather than a value to compare with
the TeX Thus, using -p =3 will start with the third page of
the document, no matter what the pages are actually
numbered.</p>

<p>--palette* Starting from dvipng 1.8, the output PNG will
be a truecolor png when an external image is included, to
avoid unnecessary delay and quality reduction, and enable
the EPS translator to draw on a transparent background and
outside of the boundingbox. This switch will force palette
(256-color) output and make dvipng revert to the old
behaviour, where included images were opaque and always
clipped to the boundingbox. This will also override the
--truecolor switch if present.</p>

<p>--picky* No images are output when a warning occurs.
Normally, dvipng will output an image in spite of a warning,
but there may be something missing in this image. One reason
to use this option would be if you have a more complete but
slower fallback converter. Mainly, this is useful for failed
figure inclusion and unknown cial occurrences, but warnings
will also occur for missing or unknown color specs and
missing PK fonts.</p>

<p>--png* The images are output in the PNG format. This is
the default for the dvipng binary. See also the --gif
option.</p>

<p>-pp firstpage-lastpage Print pages firstpage through
lastpage; but not quite equivalent to -p firstpage -l
lastpage. For example, when rendering a book, there may be
several instances of a page in the DVI file (one in
&quot;ont- c matter&quot;, one in &quot;inmatter&quot;, and
one in &quot;ktter&quot;). In mcase of several pages
matching, -pp firstpage-lastpage will render all pages that
matches the specified range, while -p firstpage -l last-
page will render the pages from the first occurrence of
firstpage to the first occurrence of lastpage. This is the
(undocumented) behaviour of dvips. In dvipng you can give
both kinds of options, in which case you get all pages that
matches the range in -pp between the pages from -p to -l.
Also multiple -pp options accumu- late, unlike -p and -l.
The - separator can also be :. Note that -pp -1 will be
interpreted as &quot;all pages up to and including 1&quot;,
if you want a page numbered -1 (only the table of contents,
say) put -pp -1--1, or more readable, -pp -1:-1.</p>

<p>-q* Run quietly. Dont chatter about pages converted,
etc. to standard output; report no warnings (only errors) to
standard error.</p>

<p>-Q num Set the quality to num. That is, choose the
number of antialiasing levels for PK and T1lib rendering to
be num*num+1. The default value is 4 which gives 17 levels
of antialiasing for antialiased fonts from these two. If
FreeType is available, its rendering is unaffected by this
option.</p>

<p>-r* Toggle output of pages in reverse/forward order. By
default, the first page in the DVI is output first.</p>

<p>--strict* The program exits when a warning occurs.
Normally, dvipng will out- put an image in spite of a
warning, but there may be something missing in this image.
One reason to use this option would be if you have a more
complete but slower fallback converter. See the --picky
option above for a list of when warnings occur.</p>

<p>-T image_size Set the image size to image_size which can
be either of bbox, tight, or a comma-separated pair of
dimensions hsize,vsize such as .1in,.3cm. The default is
bbox which produces a PNG that includes all ink put on the
page and in addition the DVI origin, located 1in from the
top and 1in from the left edge of the paper. This usually
gives whitespace above and to the left in the produced
image. The value tight will make dvipng only include all ink
put on the page, producing neat images.</p>

<p>--t1lib* Enable/disable T1lib font rendering (default
on). This option is available if the T1lib font library was
present at compilation time. If this is the case, dvipng
will have direct support for PostScript Type1 fonts
internally, rather than using gsftopk for rendering the
fonts. If you have PostScript versions of Computer Modern
installed, there will be no need to generate bitmapped vari-
ants on disk of these. Then, you can render images at
different (and unusual) resolutions without cluttering the
disk with lots of bitmapped fonts. Note that if you have
both FreeType and T1lib on your system FreeType will be
preferred by dvipng, and if you for some reason rather want
to use T1lib, give the option --freetype0 (see above).</p>

<p>--truecolor* This will make dvipng generate truecolor
output. Note that true- color output is automatic if you
include an external image in your DVI, e.g., via a
PostScript special (i.e., the graphics or graphicx package).
This switch is overridden by the --palette switch.</p>

<p>-v* Enable verbose operation. This will currently
indicate what fonts is used, in addition to the usual
output.</p>

<p>-x num Set the x magnification ratio to num/1000.
Overrides the magnifica- tion specified in the DVI file.
Must be between 10 and 100000. It is recommended that you
use standard magstep values (1095, 1200, 1440, 1728, 2074,
2488, 2986, and so on) to help reduce the total number of PK
files generated. num may be a real number, not an integer,
for increased precision.</p>

<p>-z num Set the PNG compression level to num. This option
is enabled if your libgd is new enough. The default
compression level is 1, which selects maximum speed at the
price of slightly larger PNGs. For an older libgd, the
hard-soldered value 5 is used. The include file png.h says
&quot;Currently, valid values range from 0 - 9,
corresponding directly to the zlib compression levels 0 - 9
(0 - no compression, 9 - &quot;maximal&quot; compression).
Note that tests have shown that zlib compression levels 3-6
usually perform as well as level 9 for PNG images, and do
considerably fewer calculations. In the future, these values
may not correspond directly to the zlib compression
levels.&quot;</p>
