<p>XDrawArc(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XDrawArc(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDrawArc, XDrawArcs, XArc - draw arcs and arc
structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XDrawArc(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
int x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, int
angle1, int angle2);</p>

<p>int XDrawArcs(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XArc
*arcs, int narcs);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS angle1 Specifies the start of the arc relative
to the three-oclock position from the center, in units of
degrees * 64.</p>

<p>angle2 Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative
to the start of the arc, in units of degrees * 64.</p>

<p>arcs Specifies an array of arcs.</p>

<p>d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>narcs Specifies the number of arcs in the array.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height, which are the
major and minor axes of the arc.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
to the origin of the drawable and specify the upper-left
corner of the bounding rectangle.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XDrawArc draws a single circular or
elliptical arc, and XDrawArcs draws multiple circular or
elliptical arcs. Each arc is specified by a rect- angle and
two angles. The center of the circle or ellipse is the cen-
ter of the rectangle, and the major and minor axes are
specified by the width and height. Positive angles indicate
counterclockwise motion, and negative angles indicate
clockwise motion. If the magnitude of angle2 is greater than
360 degrees, XDrawArc or XDrawArcs truncates it to 360
degrees.</p>

<p>For an arc specified as
[x,y,width,height,angle1,angle2], the origin of the major
and minor axes is at [x+_____,y+______], and the infinitely
thin path describing the entire circle or ellipse intersects
the hori- zontal axis at [x,y+______] and [x+width,y+______]
and intersects the vertical axis at [x+_____,y] and
[x+_____,y+height]. These coordinates can be fractional and
so are not truncated to discrete coordinates. The path
should be defined by the ideal mathematical path. For a wide
line with line-width lw, the bounding outlines for filling
are given by the two infinitely thin paths consisting of all
points whose perpendic- ular distance from the path of the
circle/ellipse is equal to lw/2 (which may be a fractional
value). The cap-style and join-style are applied the same as
for a line corresponding to the tangent of the cir-
cle/ellipse at the endpoint.</p>

<p>For an arc specified as
[x,y,width,height,angle1,angle2], the angles must be
specified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of the
ellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems are
identi- cal). The relationship between these angles and
angles expressed in the normal coordinate system of the
screen (as measured with a protrac- tor) is as follows:</p>

<p>skewed-angle=atan(tan(normal-angle)*______)+adjust</p>

<p>The skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in
radians (rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range
[0,2] and where atan returns a value in the range __] and
adjust is:</p>

<p>l l. 0 for normal-angle in the range [0_] for
normal-angle in the range _,_] 2 for normal-angle in the
range [_,2]</p>

<p>For any given arc, XDrawArc and XDrawArcs do not draw a
pixel more than once. If two arcs join correctly and if the
line-width is greater than zero and the arcs intersect,
XDrawArc and XDrawArcs do not draw a pixel more than once.
Otherwise, the intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs are
drawn multiple times. Specifying an arc with one endpoint
and a clockwise extent draws the same pixels as specifying
the other end- point and an equivalent counterclockwise
extent, except as it affects joins.</p>

<p>If the last point in one arc coincides with the first
point in the fol- lowing arc, the two arcs will join
correctly. If the first point in the first arc coincides
with the last point in the last arc, the two arcs will join
correctly. By specifying one axis to be zero, a hori- zontal
or vertical line can be drawn. Angles are computed based
solely on the coordinate system and ignore the aspect
ratio.</p>

<p>Both functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, line- width, line-style, cap-style, join-style,
fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin,
and clip-mask. They also use these GC mode-dependent
components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-
stipple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin, dash-offset, and
dash-list.</p>

<p>XDrawArc and XDrawArcs can generate BadDrawable, BadGC,
and BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XArc structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { short x, y; unsigned short width,
height; short angle1, angle2; /* Degrees * 64 */ } XArc;</p>

<p>All x and y members are signed integers. The width and
height members are 16-bit unsigned integers. You should be
careful not to generate coordinates and sizes out of the
16-bit ranges, because the protocol only has 16-bit fields
for these values.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>
