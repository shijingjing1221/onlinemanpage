<p>PTHREAD_SETAFFINITY_NP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SETAFFINITY_NP(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_setaffinity_np, pthread_getaffinity_np -
set/get CPU affinity of a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_t thread, size_t
cpusetsize, const cpu_set_t *cpuset); int
pthread_getaffinity_np(pthread_t thread, size_t cpusetsize,
cpu_set_t *cpuset);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_setaffinity_np() sets the CPU
affinity mask of the thread thread to the CPU set pointed to
by cpuset. If the call is successful, and the thread is not
currently running on one of the CPUs in cpuset, then it is
migrated to one of those CPUs.</p>

<p>The pthread_getaffinity_np() function returns the CPU
affinity mask of the thread thread in the buffer pointed to
by cpuset.</p>

<p>For more details on CPU affinity masks, see
sched_setaffinity(2). For a description of a set of macros
that can be used to manipulate and inspect CPU sets, see
CPU_SET(3).</p>

<p>The argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the
buffer pointed to by cpuset. Typically, this argument would
be specified as sizeof(cpu_set_t). (It may be some other
value, if using the macros described in CPU_SET(3) for
dynamically allocating a CPU set.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT A supplied memory address was invalid.</p>

<p>EINVAL (pthread_setaffinity_np()) The affinity bit mask
mask contains no processors that are currently physically on
the system and permitted to the thread according to any
restrictions that may be imposed by the &quot;cpuset&quot;
mechanism described in cpuset(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL (pthread_setaffinity_np()) cpuset specified a CPU
that was out- side the set supported by the kernel. (The
kernel configuration option CONFIG_NR_CPUS defines the range
of the set supported by the kernel data type used to
represent CPU sets.)</p>

<p>EINVAL (pthread_getaffinity_np()) cpusetsize is smaller
than the size of the affinity mask used by the kernel.</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread with the ID thread could be found.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are provided by glibc since
version 2.3.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are non-standard GNU
extensions; hence the suffix &quot;_np&quot; (non-portable)
in the names.</p>

<p>NOTES After a call to pthread_setaffinity_np(), the set
of CPUs on which the thread will actually run is the
intersection of the set specified in the cpuset argument and
the set of CPUs actually present on the system. The system
may further restrict the set of CPUs on which the thread
runs if the &quot;cpuset&quot; mechanism described in
cpuset(7) is being used. These restrictions on the actual
set of CPUs on which the thread will run are silently
imposed by the kernel.</p>

<p>These functions are implemented on top of the
sched_setaffinity(2) and sched_getaffinity(2) system
calls.</p>

<p>In glibc 2.3.3 only, versions of these functions were
provided that did not have a cpusetsize argument. Instead
the CPU set size given to the underlying system calls was
always sizeof(cpu_set_t).</p>

<p>A new thread created by pthread_create() inherits a copy
of its cre- ators CPU affinity mask.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE In the following program, the main thread uses
pthread_setaffinity_np() to set its CPU affinity mask to
include CPUs 0 to 7 (which may not all be available on the
system), and then calls pthread_getaffinity_np() to check
the resulting CPU affinity mask of the thread.</p>

cpuset; pthread_t thread;</p>

<p>thread = pthread_self();</p>

<p>/* Set affinity mask to include CPUs 0 to 7 */</p>

<p>CPU_ZERO(&amp;cpuset); for (j = 0; j &lt; 8; j++)
CPU_SET(j, &amp;cpuset);</p>

<p>s = pthread_setaffinity_np(thread, sizeof(cpu_set_t),
&amp;cpuset); if (s != 0) handle_error_en(s,
&quot;pthread_setaffinity_np&quot;);</p>

<p>/* Check the actual affinity mask assigned to the thread
*/</p>

<p>s = pthread_getaffinity_np(thread, sizeof(cpu_set_t),
&amp;cpuset); if (s != 0) handle_error_en(s,
&quot;pthread_getaffinity_np&quot;);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Set returned by pthread_getaffinity_np()
contained:0); for (j = 0; j &lt; CPU_SETSIZE; j++) if
(CPU_ISSET(j, &amp;cpuset)) printf(&quot; CPU %d0, j);</p>
