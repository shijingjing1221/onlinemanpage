<p>SETKEYCODES(8) Keyboard Support SETKEYCODES(8)</p>

<p>NAME setkeycodes - load kernel scancode-to-keycode
mapping table entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setkeycodes scancode keycode ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setkeycodes command reads its arguments
two at a time, each pair of arguments consisting of a
scancode (given in hexadecimal) and a keycode (given in
decimal). For each such pair, it tells the kernel keyboard
driver to map the specified scancode to the specified
keycode.</p>

<p>This command is useful only for people with slightly
unusual keyboards, that have a few keys which produce
scancodes that the kernel does not recognize.</p>

<p>THEORY The usual PC keyboard produces a series of
scancodes for each key press and key release. (Scancodes are
shown by showkey -s, see showkey(1).) The kernel parses this
stream of scancodes, and converts it to a stream of keycodes
(key press/release events). (Keycodes are shown by showkey.)
Apart from a few scancodes with special meaning, and apart
from the sequence produced by the Pause key, and apart from
shiftstate related scancodes, and apart from the key up/down
bit, the stream of scancodes consists of unescaped scancodes
xx (7 bits) and escaped scan- codes e0 xx (8+7 bits). It is
hardwired in the current kernel that in the range 1-88
(0x01-0x58) keycode equals scancode. For the remaining
scancodes (0x59-0x7f) or scancode pairs (0xe0 0x00 - 0xe0
0x7f) a cor- responding keycode can be assigned (in the
range 1-127). For example, if you have a Macro key that
produces e0 6f according to showkey(1), the command
setkeycodes e06f 112 will assign the keycode 112 to it, and
then loadkeys(1) can be used to define the function of this
key.</p>

<p>USB keyboards have standardized keycodes and setkeycodes
doesnt affect them at all.</p>

<p>2.6 KERNELS In 2.6 kernels key codes lie in the range
1-255, instead of 1-127. (It might be best to confine
oneself to the range 1-239.)</p>

<p>In 2.6 kernels raw mode, or scancode mode, is not very
raw at all. The code returned by showkey -s will change
after use of setkeycodes. A kernel bug. See also
showkey(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>BUGS The keycodes of X have nothing to do with those of
Linux. Unusual keys can be made visible under Linux, but not
under X.</p>

<p>setkeycodes affects only the &quot;first&quot; input
device that has modifiable scancode-to-keycode mapping. If
there is more than one such device, setkeycodes cannot
change the mapping of other devices than the
&quot;first&quot; one.</p>
