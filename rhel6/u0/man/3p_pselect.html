<p>PSELECT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PSELECT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pselect, select - synchronous I/O multiplexing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/select.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pselect(int nfds, fd_set *restrict readfds, fd_set
*restrict writefds, fd_set *restrict errorfds, const struct
timespec *restrict timeout, const sigset_t *restrict
sigmask); int select(int nfds, fd_set *restrict readfds,
fd_set *restrict writefds, fd_set *restrict errorfds, struct
timeval *restrict timeout); void FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set
*fdset); int FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *fdset); void
FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *fdset); void FD_ZERO(fd_set
*fdset);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pselect() function shall examine the
file descriptor sets whose addresses are passed in the
readfds, writefds, and errorfds parameters to see whether
some of their descriptors are ready for reading, are ready
for writing, or have an exceptional condition pending,
respec- tively.</p>

<p>The select() function shall be equivalent to the
pselect() function, except as follows:</p>

<p>* For the select() function, the timeout period is given
in seconds and microseconds in an argument of type struct
timeval, whereas for the pselect() function the timeout
period is given in seconds and nanoseconds in an argument of
type struct timespec.</p>

<p>* The select() function has no sigmask argument; it
shall behave as pselect() does when sigmask is a null
pointer.</p>

<p>* Upon successful completion, the select() function may
modify the object pointed to by the timeout argument.</p>

<p>The pselect() and select() functions shall support
regular files, ter- minal and pseudo-terminal devices,
STREAMS-based files, FIFOs, pipes, and sockets. The behavior
of pselect() and select() on file descriptors that refer to
other types of file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The nfds argument specifies the range of descriptors to
be tested. The first nfds descriptors shall be checked in
each set; that is, the descriptors from zero through nfds-1
in the descriptor sets shall be examined.</p>

<p>If the readfds argument is not a null pointer, it points
to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies the file
descriptors to be checked for being ready to read, and on
output indicates which file descriptors are ready to
read.</p>

<p>If the writefds argument is not a null pointer, it
points to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies
the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write,
and on output indicates which file descriptors are ready to
write.</p>

<p>If the errorfds argument is not a null pointer, it
points to an object of type fd_set that on input specifies
the file descriptors to be checked for error conditions
pending, and on output indicates which file descriptors have
error conditions pending.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the pselect() or select()
function shall modify the objects pointed to by the readfds,
writefds, and errorfds arguments to indicate which file
descriptors are ready for reading, ready for writing, or
have an error condition pending, respectively, and shall
return the total number of ready descriptors in all the out-
put sets. For each file descriptor less than nfds, the
corresponding bit shall be set on successful completion if
it was set on input and the associated condition is true for
that file descriptor.</p>

<p>If none of the selected descriptors are ready for the
requested opera- tion, the pselect() or select() function
shall block until at least one of the requested operations
becomes ready, until the timeout occurs, or until
interrupted by a signal. The timeout parameter controls how
long the pselect() or select() function shall take before
timing out. If the timeout parameter is not a null pointer,
it specifies a maximum inter- val to wait for the selection
to complete. If the specified time interval expires without
any requested operation becoming ready, the function shall
return. If the timeout parameter is a null pointer, then the
call to pselect() or select() shall block indefinitely until
at least one descriptor meets the specified criteria. To
effect a poll, the timeout parameter should not be a null
pointer, and should point to a zero-valued timespec
structure.</p>

<p>The use of a timeout does not affect any pending timers
set up by alarm(), ualarm(), or setitimer().</p>

<p>Implementations may place limitations on the maximum
timeout interval supported. All implementations shall
support a maximum timeout interval of at least 31 days. If
the timeout argument specifies a timeout inter- val greater
than the implementation-defined maximum value, the maximum
value shall be used as the actual timeout value.
Implementations may also place limitations on the
granularity of timeout intervals. If the requested timeout
interval requires a finer granularity than the imple-
mentation supports, the actual timeout interval shall be
rounded up to the next supported value.</p>

<p>If sigmask is not a null pointer, then the pselect()
function shall replace the signal mask of the process by the
set of signals pointed to by sigmask before examining the
descriptors, and shall restore the sig- nal mask of the
process before returning.</p>

<p>A descriptor shall be considered ready for reading when
a call to an input function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not
block, whether or not the function would transfer data
successfully. (The function might return data, an
end-of-file indication, or an error other than one
indicating that it is blocked, and in each of these cases
the descrip- tor shall be considered ready for reading.)</p>

<p>A descriptor shall be considered ready for writing when
a call to an output function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not
block, whether or not the function would transfer data
successfully.</p>

<p>If a socket has a pending error, it shall be considered
to have an exceptional condition pending. Otherwise, what
constitutes an exceptional condition is file type-specific.
For a file descriptor for use with a socket, it is
protocol-specific except as noted below. For other file
types it is implementation-defined. If the operation is
meaningless for a particular file type, pselect() or
select() shall indicate that the descriptor is ready for
read or write operations, and shall indicate that the
descriptor has no exceptional condition pend- ing.</p>

<p>If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied input
function is the recvmsg() function with parameters
requesting normal and ancillary data, such that the presence
of either type shall cause the socket to be marked as
readable. The presence of out-of-band data shall be checked
if the socket option SO_OOBINLINE has been enabled, as
out-of- band data is enqueued with normal data. If the
socket is currently lis- tening, then it shall be marked as
readable if an incoming connection request has been
received, and a call to the accept() function shall complete
without blocking.</p>

<p>If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied output
function is the sendmsg() function supplying an amount of
normal data equal to the cur- rent value of the SO_SNDLOWAT
option for the socket. If a non-blocking call to the
connect() function has been made for a socket, and the con-
nection attempt has either succeeded or failed leaving a
pending error, the socket shall be marked as writable.</p>

<p>A socket shall be considered to have an exceptional
condition pending if a receive operation with O_NONBLOCK
clear for the open file descrip- tion and with the MSG_OOB
flag set would return out-of-band data with- out blocking.
(It is protocol-specific whether the MSG_OOB flag would be
used to read out-of-band data.) A socket shall also be
considered to have an exceptional condition pending if an
out-of-band data mark is present in the receive queue. Other
circumstances under which a socket may be considered to have
an exceptional condition pending are proto- col-specific and
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments are all
null pointers and the timeout argument is not a null
pointer, the pselect() or select() function shall block for
the time specified, or until inter- rupted by a signal. If
the readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments are all null
pointers and the timeout argument is a null pointer, the
pselect() or select() function shall block until interrupted
by a sig- nal.</p>

<p>File descriptors associated with regular files shall
always select true for ready to read, ready to write, and
error conditions.</p>

<p>On failure, the objects pointed to by the readfds,
writefds, and errorfds arguments shall not be modified. If
the timeout interval expires without the specified condition
being true for any of the spec- ified file descriptors, the
objects pointed to by the readfds, writefds, and errorfds
arguments shall have all bits set to 0.</p>

<p>File descriptor masks of type fd_set can be initialized
and tested with FD_CLR(), FD_ISSET(), FD_SET(), and
FD_ZERO(). It is unspecified whether each of these is a
macro or a function. If a macro definition is suppressed in
order to access an actual function, or a program defines an
external identifier with any of these names, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>FD_CLR(fd, fdsetp) shall remove the file descriptor fd
from the set pointed to by fdsetp. If fd is not a member of
this set, there shall be no effect on the set, nor will an
error be returned.</p>

<p>FD_ISSET(fd, fdsetp) shall evaluate to non-zero if the
file descriptor fd is a member of the set pointed to by
fdsetp, and shall evaluate to zero otherwise.</p>

<p>FD_SET(fd, fdsetp) shall add the file descriptor fd to
the set pointed to by fdsetp. If the file descriptor fd is
already in this set, there shall be no effect on the set,
nor will an error be returned.</p>

<p>FD_ZERO(fdsetp) shall initialize the descriptor set
pointed to by fdsetp to the null set. No error is returned
if the set is not empty at the time FD_ZERO() is
invoked.</p>

<p>The behavior of these macros is undefined if the fd
argument is less than 0 or greater than or equal to
FD_SETSIZE, or if fd is not a valid file descriptor, or if
any of the arguments are expressions with side effects.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the pselect()
and select() functions shall return the total number of bits
set in the bit masks. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and
errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>FD_CLR(), FD_SET(), and FD_ZERO() do not return a value.
FD_ISSET() shall return a non-zero value if the bit for the
file descriptor fd is set in the file descriptor set pointed
to by fdset, and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>ERRORS Under the following conditions, pselect() and
select() shall fail and set errno to:</p>

<p>EBADF One or more of the file descriptor sets specified
a file descriptor that is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINTR The function was interrupted before any of the
selected events occurred and before the timeout interval
expired.</p>

<p>If SA_RESTART has been set for the interrupting signal,
it is implemen- tation-defined whether the function restarts
or returns with [EINTR].</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid timeout interval was specified.</p>

<p>EINVAL The nfds argument is less than 0 or greater than
FD_SETSIZE.</p>

<p>EINVAL One of the specified file descriptors refers to a
STREAM or mul- tiplexer that is linked (directly or
indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE In previous versions of the Single UNIX
Specification, the select() function was defined in the
&lt;sys/time.h&gt; header. This is now changed to
&lt;sys/select.h&gt;. The rationale for this change was as
follows: the introduction of the pselect() function included
the &lt;sys/select.h&gt; header and the &lt;sys/select.h&gt;
header defines all the related defini- tions for the
pselect() and select() functions. Backwards-compatibility to
existing XSI implementations is handled by allowing
&lt;sys/time.h&gt; to include &lt;sys/select.h&gt;.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
