<p>NAME autofs - Format of the automounter maps</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The automounter maps are FILE, NIS, NISPLUS
or LDAP maps referred to by the master map of the
automounter (see auto.master(5)). These maps describe how
file systems below the mount point of the map (given in the
master map) are to be mounted. This page describes the sun
map format; if another map format is specified (e.g.
hesiod), this documen- tation does not apply.</p>

<p>Indirect maps can be changed on the fly and the
automouter will recog- nize those changes on the next
operation it performs on that map. Direct maps require a HUP
signal be sent to the daemon to refresh their contents as
does the master map.</p>

<p>FORMAT This is a description of the text file format.
Other methods of speci- fying these files may exist. All
empty lines or lines beginning with # are ignored. The basic
format of one line in such maps is:</p>

<p>key [-options] location</p>

<p>key For indirect mounts this is the part of the path
name between the mount point and the path into the
filesystem when it is mounted. Usually you can think about
the key as a sub-directory name below the autofs man- aged
mount point.</p>

<p>For direct mounts this is the full path of each mount
point. This map is always associated with the /- mount point
in the master map.</p>

<p>options Zero or more options may be given. Options can
also be given in the auto.master file in which case both
values are cumulative (this is a difference from SunOS). The
options are a list of comma separated options as customary
for the mount(8) command. There are two special options
-fstype= used to specify a filesystem type if the filesystem
is not of the default NFS type. This option is processed by
the auto- mounter and not by the mount command. -strict is
used to treat errors when mounting file systems as fatal.
This is important when multiple file systems should be
mounted (multi-mounts). If this option is given, no file
system is mounted at all if at least one file system cant be
mounted.</p>

<p>location The location specifies from where the file
system is to be mounted. In the most cases this will be an
NFS volume and the usual notation host:pathname is used to
indicate the remote filesystem and path to be mounted. If
the filesystem to be mounted begins with a / (such as local
/dev entries or smbfs shares) a : needs to be prefixed (e.g.
:/dev/sda1).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Indirect map:</p>

<p>kernel -ro,soft,intr ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux boot
-fstype=ext2 :/dev/hda1 windoze -fstype=smbfs ://windoze/c
removable -fstype=ext2 :/dev/hdd cd -fstype=iso9660,ro
:/dev/hdc floppy -fstype=auto :/dev/fd0 server -rw,hard,intr
/ -ro myserver.me.org:/ /usr myserver.me.org:/usr /home
myserver.me.org:/home</p>

<p>In the first line we have a NFS remote mount of the
kernel directory on ftp.kernel.org. This is mounted
read-only. The second line mounts an ext2 volume from a
local ide drive. The third makes a share exported from a
Windows machine available for automounting. The rest should
be fairly self-explanatory. The last entry (the last three
lines) is an example of a multi-map (see below).</p>

<p>If you use the automounter for a filesystem without
access permissions (like vfat), users usually cant write on
such a filesystem because it is mounted as user root. You
can solve this problem by passing the option
gid=&lt;gid&gt;, e.g. gid=floppy. The filesystem is then
mounted as group floppy instead of root. Then you can add
the users to this group, and they can write to the
filesystem. Here s an example entry for an autofs map:</p>

<p>floppy-vfat -fstype=vfat,sync,gid=floppy,umask=002
:/dev/fd0</p>

<p>Direct map:</p>

<p>/nfs/apps/mozilla bogus:/usr/local/moxill
/nfs/data/budgets tiger:/usr/local/budgets /tst/sbin
bogus:/usr/sbin</p>

<p>FEATURES Map Key Substitution An &amp; character in the
location is expanded to the value of the key field that
matched the line (which probably only makes sense together
with a wildcard key).</p>

<p>Wildcard Key A map key of * denotes a wild-card entry.
This entry is consulted if the specified key does not exist
in the map. A typical wild-card entry looks like this:</p>

<p>* server:/export/home/&amp;</p>

<p>The special character &amp; will be replaced by the
provided key. So, in the example above, a lookup for the key
foo would yield a mount of server:/export/home/foo.</p>

<p>Variable Substitution The following special variables
will be substituted in the key and location fields of an
automounter map if prefixed with $ as customary from shell
scripts (Curly braces can be used to separate the field
name):</p>

<p>ARCH Architecture (uname -m) CPU Processor Type HOST
Hostname (uname -n) OSNAME Operating System (uname -s) OSREL
Release of OS (uname -r) OSVERS Version of OS (uname -v)</p>

<p>autofs provides additional variables that are set based
on the user requesting the mount:</p>

<p>USER The user login name UID The user login ID GROUP The
user group name GID The user group ID HOME The user home
directory HOST Hostname (uname -n)</p>

<p>Additional entries can be defined with the
-Dvariable=Value map-option to automount(8).</p>

<p>Executable Maps A map can be marked as executable. A
program map will be called with the key as an argument. It
may return no lines of output if theres an error, or one or
more lines containing a map entry (with quoting line
breaks). The map entry corresponds to what would normally
follow a map key.</p>

<p>An executable map can return an error code to indicate
the failure in addition to no output at all. All output sent
to stderr is logged into the system logs.</p>

<p>Multiple Mounts A multi-mount map can be used to name
multiple filesystems to mount. It takes the form:</p>

<p>key [-options] [mount-point [-options]
location...]...</p>

<p>This may extend over multiple lines, quoting the
line-breaks with &lsquo;&acute;. If present, the
per-mountpoint mount-options are appended to the default
mount-options.</p>

<p>Replicated Server Multiple replicated hosts, same path:
&lt;path&gt; host1,host2,hostn:/path/path</p>

<p>Multiple hosts, some with same path, some with another
&lt;path&gt; host1,host2:/blah host3:/some/other/path</p>

<p>Multiple replicated hosts, different (potentially)
paths: &lt;path&gt; host1:/path/pathA host2:/path/pathB</p>

<p>Mutliple weighted, replicated hosts same path:
&lt;path&gt; host1(5),host2(6),host3(1):/path/path</p>

<p>Multiple weighted, replicated hosts different
(potentially) paths: &lt;path&gt; host1(3):/path/pathA
host2(5):/path/pathB</p>

<p>Anything else is questionable and unsupported, but these
variations will also work: &lt;path&gt;
host1(3),host:/blah</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED This version of the automounter supports
direct maps stored in FILE, NIS, NISPLUS and LDAP only.</p>
