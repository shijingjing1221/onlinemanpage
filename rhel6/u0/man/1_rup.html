<p>NAME rup - remote status display</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rup [-dshlt] [host ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rup displays a summary of the current system
status of a particular host or all hosts on the local
network. The output shows the current time of day, how long
the system has been up, and the load averages. The load
average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue
averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-d For each host, report what its local time is. This is
useful for checking time syncronization on a network.</p>

<p>-s Print time data in seconds (seconds of uptime or
seconds since the epoch), for scripts.</p>

<p>-h Sort the display alphabetically by host name.</p>

<p>-l Sort the display by load average.</p>

<p>-t Sort the display by up time.</p>

<p>The rpc.rstatd(8) daemon must be running on the remote
host for this com- mand to work. rup uses an RPC protocol
defined in /usr/include/rpcsvc/rstat.x.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE example% rup otherhost otherhost up 6 days,
16:45, load average: 0.20, 0.23, 0.18 example%</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS rup: RPC: Program not registered The
rpc.rstatd(8) daemon has not been started on the remote
host.</p>

<p>rup: RPC: Timed out A communication error occurred.
Either the network is exces- sively congested, or the
rpc.rstatd(8) daemon has terminated on the remote host.</p>

<p>rup: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Timed out The
remote host is not running the portmapper (see portmap(8) ),
and cannot accomodate any RPC-based services. The host may
be down.</p>
