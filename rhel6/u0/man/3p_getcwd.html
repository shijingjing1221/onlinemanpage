<p>GETCWD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETCWD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getcwd - get the pathname of the current working
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getcwd() function shall place an
absolute pathname of the current working directory in the
array pointed to by buf, and return buf. The pathname copied
to the array shall contain no components that are sym- bolic
links. The size argument is the size in bytes of the
character array pointed to by the buf argument. If buf is a
null pointer, the behavior of getcwd() is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getcwd() shall
return the buf argument. Otherwise, getcwd() shall return a
null pointer and set errno to indi- cate the error. The
contents of the array pointed to by buf are then
undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getcwd() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The size argument is 0.</p>

<p>ERANGE The size argument is greater than 0, but is
smaller than the length of the pathname +1.</p>

<p>The getcwd() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Read or search permission was denied for a
component of the pathname.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Determining the Absolute Pathname of the
Current Working Directory The following example returns a
pointer to an array that holds the absolute pathname of the
current working directory. The pointer is returned in the
ptr variable, which points to the buf array where the
pathname is stored.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ...
long size; char *buf; char *ptr;</p>

<p>size = pathconf(&quot;.&quot;, _PC_PATH_MAX);</p>

<p>if ((buf = (char *)malloc((size_t)size)) != NULL) ptr =
getcwd(buf, (size_t)size); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since the maximum pathname length is arbitrary
unless {PATH_MAX} is defined, an application generally
cannot supply a buf with size {{PATH_MAX}+1}.</p>

<p>Having getcwd() take no arguments and instead use the
malloc() function to produce space for the returned argument
was considered. The advan- tage is that getcwd() knows how
big the working directory pathname is and can allocate an
appropriate amount of space. But the programmer would have
to use the free() function to free the resulting object, or
each use of getcwd() would further reduce the available
memory. Also, malloc() and free() are used nowhere else in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Finally, getcwd() is
taken from the SVID where it has the two arguments used in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The older function getwd() was rejected for use in this
context because it had only a buffer argument and no size
argument, and thus had no way to prevent overwriting the
buffer, except to depend on the programmer to provide a
large enough buffer.</p>

<p>On some implementations, if buf is a null pointer,
getcwd() may obtain size bytes of memory using malloc(). In
this case, the pointer returned by getcwd() may be used as
the argument in a subsequent call to free(). Invoking
getcwd() with buf as a null pointer is not recommended in
con- forming applications.</p>

<p>If a program is operating in a directory where some
(grand)parent directory does not permit reading, getcwd()
may fail, as in most imple- mentations it must read the
directory to determine the name of the file. This can occur
if search, but not read, permission is granted in an
intermediate directory, or if the program is placed in that
direc- tory by some more privileged process (for example,
login). Including the [EACCES] error condition makes the
reporting of the error consis- tent and warns the
application writer that getcwd() can fail for rea- sons
beyond the control of the application writer or user. Some
imple- mentations can avoid this occurrence (for example, by
implementing getcwd() using pwd, where pwd is a
set-user-root process), thus the error was made optional.
Since this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 per- mits the
addition of other errors, this would be a common addition
and yet one that applications could not be expected to deal
with without this addition.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
