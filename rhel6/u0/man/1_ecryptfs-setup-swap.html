<p>NAME ecryptfs-setup-swap - ensure that any swap space is
encrypted</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ecryptfs-setup-swap [-f|--force]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This script will detect existing swap
partitions or swap files, and encrypt them, using
cryptsetup.</p>

<p>Encrypted swap is essential to securing any system using
eCryptfs, since decrypted file contents will exist in the
systems memory, which may be swapped to disk at any time. If
the system swap space is not also encrypted, it is possible
that decrypted files could be written to disk in clear
text.</p>

<p>Note that most Linux distributions do not yet support
resuming from an encrypted swap space, and thus
hibernate/resume will not work. Sus- pend/resume is
unaffected.</p>

<p>Upon running the utility, the user will be informed of
the hiber- nate/resume break, and asked to confirm the
behavior. The -f|--force option can be used to bypass this
interactive prompt.</p>
