<p>MQ_UNLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
MQ_UNLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mq_unlink - remove a message queue (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mq_unlink(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mq_unlink() function shall remove the
message queue named by the pathname name. After a successful
call to mq_unlink() with name, a call to mq_open() with name
shall fail if the flag O_CREAT is not set in flags. If one
or more processes have the message queue open when
mq_unlink() is called, destruction of the message queue
shall be post- poned until all references to the message
queue have been closed.</p>

<p>Calls to mq_open() to recreate the message queue may
fail until the message queue is actually removed. However,
the mq_unlink() call need not block until all references
have been closed; it may return immedi- ately.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the function
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, the named message
queue shall be unchanged by this function call, and the
function shall return a value of -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mq_unlink() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Permission is denied to unlink the named message
queue.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the name argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT The named message queue does not exist.</p>
