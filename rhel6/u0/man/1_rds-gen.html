<p>RDS-GEN-SINK(1) BSD General Commands Manual
RDS-GEN-SINK(1)</p>

<p>NAME rds-gen - write data from a file to an RDS
socket</p>

<p>rds-sink - write data from an RDS socket to a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rds-gen [-s source_address:source_port] [-d
destination_address:destination_port] [-f input_file] [-m
message_size] [-l total_bytes] [-i interval]</p>

<p>rds-sink [-s listen_address:listen_port] [-f
output_file] [-i interval]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rds-gen and rds-sink utilities are used
to stream data through RDS sockets. rds-gen reads data from
a file descriptor and sends it as mes- sages down an RDS
socket. rds-sink receives messages from an RDS socket and
writes it to a file descriptor.</p>

<p>The following options are shared between rds-gen and
rds-sink:</p>

<p>-s address:port Binds the RDS socket to the given
address and port. rds-gen will send messages from this
address and port. rds-sink will receive messages sent to
this address and port.</p>

<p>-f file rds-gen will read data from this file and
rds-sink will write data to this file. If - is given as the
filename then rds-gen will use standard input and rds-sink
will use standard output.</p>

<p>-i interval_seconds An iterative summary of the number
and size of messages that are sent and received is written
to standard error at this interval.</p>

<p>In addition, rds-gen supports the following options:</p>

<p>-d address:port Messages are sent to this destination
address and port. If this option is specified multiple times
then the messages are sent to each destination address in a
round-robin fashion.</p>

<p>-m message_size Specifies the size of the messages that
are sent down the RDS socket. The default message size is
4k. The message size must not be greater than the buffer
size.</p>

<p>-l total_bytes Specifies the number of bytes that will
be sent out the socket before rds-gen exits. If this is not
specified and rds-gen was given a source file then it will
run until it gets EOF from the file. If no file was given
and this option is not specified then rds-gen will send data
indefinitely.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES rds-gen on host src sends infinite data to
rds-sink on dest who prints out the amount of data it
receives every second.</p>

<p>$ rds-sink -s dest:22222 -i 1 $ rds-gen -s src:11111 -d
dest:22222</p>

<p>Read 100M from /dev/zero on src and write it to
/dev/null on dest, print- ing stats on both sides every
minute.</p>

<p>$ rds-sink -s dest:22222 -f /dev/null -i 60 $ rds-gen -s
src:11111 -f /dev/zero -d dest:22222 -i 60</p>

<p>Watch rds-gen write data as fast as it can into a local
black hole because there is no bound receiving socket.</p>

<p>$ rds-gen -s src:11111 -d localhost:31337 -i 1</p>
