<p>sane-kodak(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-kodak(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-kodak - SANE backend for big Kodak flatbed and
ADF scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-kodak library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
large Kodak flatbed and ADF scanners.</p>

<p>This document describes backend version 7, which shipped
with SANE 1.0.21.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This version should support models
which speak the Kodak SCSI and Firewire protocols. The i1860
was used to develop the backend, but other models may work
with only minimal modifications. Please see the list at
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html for
an updated list.</p>

<p>If you have a machine not on that list, or reported as
untested: the best way to determine level of support is to
test the scanner directly, or to collect a trace of the
windows driver in action. Please contact the author for help
or with test results.</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE Most of the recent Kodak consumer
or workgroup level machines are based on other chipsets and
are not supported by this backend. Some of these scanners
may be supported by another backend.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Effort has been made to expose the basic
hardware options, including:</p>

<p>source s Selects the source for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Flatbed&quot;, &quot;ADF Front&quot;,
&quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Lineart&quot;, &quot;Halftone&quot;,
&quot;Gray&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>resolution Controls scan resolution. Available choices
may be limited by mode.</p>

<p>tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y Sets scan area upper left and
lower right coordinates. These are renamed t, l, x, y by
some frontends.</p>

<p>page-width, page-height Sets paper size. Used by scanner
to determine centering of scan coordinates when using ADF
and to detect double feed errors.</p>

<p>Other options will be available based on the
capabilities of the scan- ner. Use scanimage --help to get a
list, but be aware that some options may be settable only
when another option has been set, and that advanced options
may be hidden by some frontend programs.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;kodak.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the
frontend asks the backend for a list of scanners, generally
only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults,
which are identical to the default configuration file
shipped with SANE.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2
ways:</p>

<p>&quot;scsi KODAK&quot; Requests backend to search all
scsi busses in the system for a device which reports itself
to be a scanner made by KODAK.</p>

<p>&quot;scsi /dev/sg0&quot; (or other scsi device file)
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful
if you have multiple compatible scanners connected to your
system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used
with the other &quot;scsi&quot; line above.</p>

<p>The only configuration option supported is
&quot;buffer-size=xxx&quot;, allowing you to set the number
of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the
compiled-in default, 32768 (32K). Some users report that
their scanner will &quot;hang&quot; mid-page, or fail to
transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.</p>

<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the
configuration file. It only applies to scanners discovered
by scsi/usb lines that follow this option.</p>

<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this
value, as some users required it to be quite large. Values
above the default are not recommended, and may crash your OS
or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been warned.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_KODAK, which enables debugging output
to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 SCSI trace 30 SCSI detail 35 Useless noise</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES Most hardware options are either not
supported or not exposed for con- trol by the user,
including: multifeed detection, image compression,
autocropping, endorser, iThresholding, multi-stream,
etc.</p>

<p>CREDITS The various authors of the sane-fujitsu backend
provided useful code. Kodak provided access to hardware,
documentation and personnel.</p>
