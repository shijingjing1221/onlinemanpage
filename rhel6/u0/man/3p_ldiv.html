<p>LDIV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LDIV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ldiv, lldiv - compute quotient and remainder of a
long division</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>ldiv_t ldiv(long numer, long denom); lldiv_t lldiv(long
long numer, long long denom);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the quotient
and remainder of the divi- sion of the numerator numer by
the denominator denom. If the division is inexact, the
resulting quotient is the long integer (for the ldiv()
function) or long long integer (for the lldiv() function) of
lesser magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic
quotient. If the result cannot be represented, the behavior
is undefined; otherwise, quot * denom+rem shall equal
numer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ldiv() function shall return a
structure of type ldiv_t, comprising both the quotient and
the remainder. The structure shall include the following
members, in any order:</p>

<p>long quot; /* Quotient */ long rem; /* Remainder */</p>

<p>The lldiv() function shall return a structure of type
lldiv_t, compris- ing both the quotient and the remainder.
The structure shall include the following members, in any
order:</p>

<p>long long quot; /* Quotient */ long long rem; /*
Remainder */</p>
