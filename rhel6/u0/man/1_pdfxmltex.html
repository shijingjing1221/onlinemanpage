<p>NAME xmltex, pdfxmltex - xml non-validating parser in
TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmltex xml file pdfxmltex xml file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
xmltex, and pdfxmltex commands. This manual page was written
for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has
documentation in HTML and PS format in the
/usr/share/doc/xmltex directory.</p>

<p>xmltex and pdfxmltex is a TeX XML parser able to
transform XML docu- ments into .dvi files. xmltex knows
nothing about your XML files. It needs to load some special
macros files, usually with the .xmt exten- sion. A
configuration file, either named xmltex.cfg or jobname.cfg,
is parsed. An especially useful configuration command is
xmltraceoff which disables XML elements tracing.</p>

<p>xmltex already knows about many XML schemata, such as
TEI, TEI.2, MathML, SEC, HTML and XSL-FO, the support for
the latest being provided by the passivetex package.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO The programs are documented fully in their own
manual in the /usr/share/doc/xmltex directory. latex(1),
tex(1)</p>

<p>AUTHOR This manual page was written by Fabien
Ni&ntilde;oles &lt;fabien@debian.org&gt;, for the Debian
GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).</p>
