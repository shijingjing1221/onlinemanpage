<p>NAME kerberos - introduction to the Kerberos system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Kerberos system authenticates individual
users in a network envi- ronment. After authenticating
yourself to Kerberos, you can use net- work utilities such
as rlogin, rcp, and rsh without having to present passwords
to remote hosts and without having to bother with .rhosts
files. Note that these utilities will work without passwords
only if the remote machines you deal with support the
Kerberos system.</p>

<p>If you enter your username and kinit responds with this
message:</p>

<p>kinit(v5): Client not found in Kerberos database while
getting initial credentials</p>

<p>you havent been registered as a Kerberos user. See your
system admin- istrator.</p>

<p>A Kerberos name usually contains three parts. The first
is the pri- mary, which is usually a users or service s
name. The second is the instance, which in the case of a
user is usually null. Some users may have privileged
instances, however, such as root or admin . In the case of a
service, the instance is the fully qualified name of the
machine on which it runs; i.e. there can be an rlogin
service running on the machine ABC, which is different from
the rlogin service running on the machine XYZ. The third
part of a Kerberos name is the realm. The realm corresponds
to the Kerberos service providing authentication for the
principal.</p>

<p>When writing a Kerberos name, the principal name is
separated from the instance (if not null) by a slash, and
the realm (if not the local realm) follows, preceded by an @
sign. The following are examples of valid Kerberos
names:</p>

<p>david jennifer/admin joeuser@BLEEP.COM
cbrown/root@FUBAR.ORG</p>

<p>When you authenticate yourself with Kerberos you get an
initial Ker- beros ticket. (A Kerberos ticket is an
encrypted protocol message that provides authentication.)
Kerberos uses this ticket for network utili- ties such as
rlogin and rcp. The ticket transactions are done trans-
parently, so you don t have to worry about their
management.</p>

<p>Note, however, that tickets expire. Privileged tickets,
such as those with the instance root, expire in a few
minutes, while tickets that carry more ordinary privileges
may be good for several hours or a day, depending on the
installation s policy. If your login session extends beyond
the time limit, you will have to re-authenticate yourself to
Kerberos to get new tickets. Use the kinit command to
re-authenticate yourself.</p>

<p>If you use the kinit command to get your tickets, make
sure you use the kdestroy command to destroy your tickets
before you end your login ses- sion. You should put the
kdestroy command in your .logout file so that your tickets
will be destroyed automatically when you logout. For more
information about the kinit and kdestroy commands, see the
kinit(1) and kdestroy(1) manual pages.</p>

<p>Kerberos tickets can be forwarded. In order to forward
tickets, you must request forwardable tickets when you
kinit. Once you have for- wardable tickets, most Kerberos
programs have a command line option to forward them to the
remote host.</p>

<p>Currently, Kerberos support is available for the
following network ser- vices: rlogin, rsh, rcp, telnet, ftp,
krdist (a Kerberized version of rdist), ksu (a Kerberized
version of su), login, and Xdm.</p>
