<p>DESCRIPTION Mutt is a small but very powerful text based
program for reading and sending electronic mail under unix
operating systems, including support for color terminals,
MIME, OpenPGP, and a threaded sorting mode.</p>

<p>Note: This manual page gives a brief overview of mutts
command line options. You should find a copy of the full
manual in /usr/share/doc/mutt-1.5.20, in text, HTML, and/or
PDF format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A alias An expanded version of the given alias
is passed to stdout.</p>

<p>-a file [...] Attach a file to your message using MIME.
When attaching single or multiple files, separating
filenames and recipient addresses with &quot;--&quot; is
mandatory, e.g. mutt -a image.jpg -- addr1 or mutt -a
img.jpg *.png -- addr1 addr2. The -a option must be placed
at the end of command line options.</p>

<p>-b address Specify a blind-carbon-copy (BCC)
recipient</p>

<p>-c address Specify a carbon-copy (CC) recipient</p>

<p>-d level If mutt was complied with +DEBUG log debugging
output to ~/.muttdebug0. Level can range from 1-5 and
effects verbosity. A value of 2 is recommended.</p>

<p>-D Print the value of all configuration options to
stdout.</p>

<p>-n Causes Mutt to bypass the system configuration
file.</p>

<p>-Q query Query a configuration variables value. The
query is executed after all configuration files have been
parsed, and any commands given on the command line have been
executed.</p>

<p>-R Open a mailbox in read-only mode.</p>

<p>-s subject Specify the subject of the message.</p>

<p>-v Display the Mutt version number and compile-time
definitions.</p>

<p>-vv Display license and copyright information.</p>

<p>-x Emulate the mailx compose mode.</p>

<p>-y Start Mutt with a listing of all mailboxes specified
by the mailboxes command.</p>

<p>-z When used with -f, causes Mutt not to start if there
are no mes- sages in the mailbox.</p>

<p>-Z Causes Mutt to open the first mailbox specified by
the mailboxes command which contains new mail.</p>

<p>BUGS None. Mutts have fleas, not bugs.</p>

<p>FLEAS Suspend/resume while editing a file with an
external editor does not work under SunOS 4.x if you use the
curses lib in /usr/5lib. It does work with the S-Lang
library, however.</p>

<p>Resizing the screen while using an external pager causes
Mutt to go haywire on some systems.</p>

<p>Suspend/resume does not work under Ultrix.</p>

<p>The help line for the index menu is not updated if you
change the bind- ings for one of the functions listed while
Mutt is running.</p>
