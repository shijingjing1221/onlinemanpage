<p>GETCWD(2) Linux Programmer s Manual GETCWD(2)</p>

<p>NAME getcwd - get current working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /* * This page documents the getcwd(2) system
call, which * is not defined in any user-space header files;
you should * use getcwd(3) defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;
instead in applications. */</p>

<p>long getcwd(char *buf, unsigned long size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getcwd() function copies an absolute
pathname of the current work- ing directory to the array
pointed to by buf, which is of length size.</p>

<p>If the current absolute path name would require a buffer
longer than size elements, -1 is returned, and errno is set
to ERANGE; an applica- tion should check for this error, and
allocate a larger buffer if nec- essary.</p>

<p>If buf is NULL, the behaviour of getcwd() is
undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE -1 on failure (for example, if the current
directory is not readable), with errno set accordingly, and
the number of characters stored in buf on success. The
contents of the array pointed to by buf is undefined on
error.</p>

<p>Note that this return value differs from the getcwd(3)
library func- tion, which returns NULL on failure and the
address of buf on success.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOMEM if user memory cannot be mapped</p>

<p>ENOENT if directory does not exist (i.e. it has been
deleted)</p>

<p>ERANGE if not enough space available for storing the
path</p>

<p>EFAULT if memory access violation occurs while
copying</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The getcwd system call is Linux specific,
use the getcwd C library function for portability.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getcwd(3)</p>
