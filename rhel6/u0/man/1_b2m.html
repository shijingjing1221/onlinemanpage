<p>NAME b2m - convert old Emacs Rmail Babyl format to mbox
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS b2m &lt; babyl-file &gt; mbox-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION b2m accepts Babyl format mail (as used by
older versions of Rmail in GNU Emacs) on standard input, and
converts it to mbox format on stan- dard output. Babyl was
the storage format used by Rmail prior to Emacs 23.1. Since
then, it uses standard mbox format. This program is dis-
tributed with GNU Emacs.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The program accepts unambiguous abbreviations
for long option names.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display basic usage information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO The Babyl format is described in the file
etc/BABYL in the Emacs dis- tribution. Rmail is documented
in the GNU Emacs manual, which you can read using Info,
either from Emacs or as a standalone program.</p>

<p>AUTHORS b2m was originally written by Ed Wilkinson.
Francesco Potorti updated it according to the GNU coding
standards.</p>
