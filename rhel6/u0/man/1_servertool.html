<p>NAME servertool - The Java(TM) IDL Server Tool</p>

<p>servertool provides a command-line interface for
application program- mers to register, unregister, startup,
and shutdown a persistent server.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS servertool -ORBInitialPort nameserverport
options [ commands ]</p>

<p>If you did not enter a command when starting servertool,
the com- mand-line tool displays with a servertool &gt;
prompt. Enter commands at the servertool &gt; prompt.</p>

<p>If you enter a command when starting servertool, the
Java IDL Server Tool starts, runs the command, and
exits.</p>

<p>The -ORBInitialPort nameserverport option is required.
The value for nameserverport must specify the port on which
orbd is running and lis- tening for incoming requests. When
using Solaris software, you must become root to start a
process on a port under 1024. For this reason, we recommend
that you use a port number greater than or equal to 1024 for
the nameserverport.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The servertool provides the command-line
interface for the application programmers to register,
unregister, startup, and shutdown a persistent server. Other
commands are provided to obtain various statistical
information about the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost Specifies the
host machine on which the name server is running and
listening for incoming requests. The nameserverhost defaults
to localhost if this option is not specified. If orbd and
servertool are running on different machines, you must
specify the name or IP address of the host on which orbd is
running.</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java a pplication launcher @
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html.
For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48
megabytes. It is a common convention for -J to pass options
to the underlying vir- tual machine.</p>

<p>COMMANDS register -server &lt;server class name&gt;
-classpath &lt;classpath to server&gt; [ -applicationName
&lt;applica- tion name&gt; -args &lt;args to server&gt;
-vmargs &lt;flags to be passed to Java VM&gt; ] Register a
new persistent server with the Object Request Broker Daemon
(ORBD). If the server is not already registered, it is
registered and activated. This com- mand causes an install
method to be invoked in the main class of the server
identified by the -server option. The install method must be
public static void install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The install
method is optional and enables the developer to provide
their own server installation behavior (for example,
creating database schema).</p>

<p>unregister -serverid &lt;server id &gt; |
-applicationName &lt;application name&gt; Unreg- ister a
server from the ORBD by using either its server id or its
application name. This command causes an uninstall method to
be invoked in the main class of the server identified by the
-server option. The uninstall method must be public static
void unin- stall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The uninstall method is
optional and enables the developer to provide their own
server uninstall behavior (for example, undoing the behavior
of the install method).</p>

<p>getserverid -applicationName &lt;application name&gt;
Return the server id that corre- sponds with an
application.</p>

<p>list List information about all persistent servers
registered with the ORBD.</p>

<p>listappnames List the application names for all servers
currently registered with the ORBD.</p>

<p>listactive List information about all persistent servers
that have been launched by the ORBD and are currently
running.</p>

<p>locate -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName
&lt;application name&gt; [-endpointType &lt;endpointType&gt;
] Locate the endpoints (ports) of a specific type for all
ORBs created by a registered server. If a server is not
already running, it is activated. If an endpoint type is not
specified, then the plain/non-protected endpoint associated
with each ORB in a server is returned.</p>

<p>locateperorb -serverid &lt;server id &gt; |
-applicationName &lt;application name&gt; [-orbid &lt;ORB
name&gt; ] Locate all the endpoints (ports) registered by a
specific ORB of registered server. If a server is not
already run- ning, then it is activated. If an orbid is not
specified, the default value of &quot;&quot; is assigned to
the orbid. If any ORBs are cre- ated with an orbid of empty
string, all ports registered by it are returned.</p>

<p>orblist -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName
&lt;application name&gt; Lists the ORBId of the ORBs defined
on a server. An ORBId is the string name for the ORB created
by the server. If the server is not already running, it is
acti- vated.</p>

<p>shutdown -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName
&lt;application name&gt; Shutdown an active server that is
registered with ORBD. During execution of this command, the
shut- down() method defined in the class specified by either
the -serverid or -applicationName parameter is also invoked
to shutdown the server process appropriately.</p>

<p>startup -serverid &lt;server id &gt; | -applicationName
&lt;application name&gt; Startup or activate a server that
is registered with ORBD. If the server is not running, this
command launches the server. If the server is already
running, an error message is returned to the user.</p>

<p>help List all the commands available to the server
through the server tool.</p>

<p>quit Exit the server tool.</p>
