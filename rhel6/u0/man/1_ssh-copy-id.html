<p>NAME ssh-copy-id - install your public key in a remote
machines autho- rized_keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ssh-copy-id [-i [identity_file]]
[user@]machine</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh to log
into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so
password authentication should be enabled, unless youve done
some clever use of multiple identities)</p>

<p>It also changes the permissions of the remote users
home, ~/.ssh, and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to remove group
writability (which would other- wise prevent you from
logging in, if the remote sshd has StrictModes set in its
configuration).</p>

<p>If the -i option is given then the identity file
(defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) is used, regardless of
whether there are any keys in your ssh-agent. Otherwise, if
this:</p>

<p>ssh-add -L</p>

<p>provides any output, it uses that in preference to the
identity file.</p>

<p>If the -i option is used, or the ssh-add produced no
output, then it uses the contents of the identity file. Once
it has one or more fin- gerprints (by whatever means) it
uses ssh to append them to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the
remote machine (creating the file, and directory, if
necessary)</p>
