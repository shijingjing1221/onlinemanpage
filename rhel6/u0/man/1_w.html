<p>W(1) Linux User s Manual W(1)</p>

<p>NAME w - Show who is logged on and what they are
doing.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS w - [husfV] [user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION w displays information about the users
currently on the machine, and their processes. The header
shows, in this order, the current time, how long the system
has been running, how many users are currently logged on,
and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 min-
utes.</p>

<p>The following entries are displayed for each user: login
name, the tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time,
JCPU, PCPU, and the com- mand line of their current
process.</p>

<p>The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached
to the tty. It does not include past background jobs, but
does include currently running background jobs.</p>

<p>The PCPU time is the time used by the current process,
named in the &quot;what&quot; field.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS -h Dont print the header.</p>

<p>-u Ignores the username while figuring out the current
process and cpu times. To demonstrate this, do a
&quot;su&quot; and do a &quot;w&quot; and a &quot;w
-u&quot;.</p>

<p>-s Use the short format. Dont print the login time, JCPU
or PCPU times.</p>

<p>-f Toggle printing the from (remote hostname) field. The
default as released is for the from field to not be printed,
although your system administrator or distribution
maintainer may have compiled a version in which the from
field is shown by default.</p>

<p>-V Display version information.</p>

<p>user Show information about the specified user only.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/utmp information about who is currently
logged on</p>

<p>/proc process information</p>

<p>SEE ALSO free(1), ps(1), top(1), uptime(1), utmp(5),
who(1)</p>

<p>AUTHORS w was re-written almost entirely by Charles
Blake, based on the version by Larry Greenfield
&lt;greenfie@gauss.rutgers.edu&gt; and Michael K. Johnson
&lt;johnsonm@redhat.com&gt;.</p>
