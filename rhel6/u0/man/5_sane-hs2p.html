<p>sane-hs2p(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-hs2p(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-hs2p - SANE backend for Ricoh SCSI flatbed/ADF
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-hs2p library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
the Ricoh IS450 family of scanners. Should also work with
the IS420, IS410, and IS430 scanners, but these are
untested. Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel
mailing list if you own such a scanner.</p>

<p>This backend is alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some
scanners havent been tested at all. Be careful and pull the
plug if the scanner causes unusual noise.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. The program
sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct device.
Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sg0 or
/dev/sga, for example. See sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the hs2p.conf file is a
list of device names that cor- respond to SCSI scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a
valid device name.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/hs2p.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hs2p.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hs2p.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_HS2P If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. A value of 255 prints all
debug output. Smaller values reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>CURRENT STATUS The hs2p backend is now in version 1.00.
All major scanning-related features are supported, except
for those features requiring the optional IPU. Scanning from
the flatbed or ADF (either simplex or duplex) is supported.
Lineart, halftone, 4-bit gray, and 8-bit gray are supported.
Pre-set gamma tables and halftone patterns are supported, as
well as brightness, threshold, contrast. Also supported is
scan wait mode, binary and gray filtering, negative
scanning, and absolute or relative white setting. Printing
with the optional endorser also is supported.</p>

<p>PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY This scanner can scan from the ADF
in continuous simplex mode. Sur- prisingly, many scanners
scan an entire document from the ADF into mem- ory before
ejecting the sheet. Thus if the document is too long, the
scanner cannot hold the entire image data in memory. But if
the scan- ner would send its image data when its memory got
full, and then read the next buffers worth of data,
continuous scanning could be achieved.</p>

<p>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY The SCSI commands for uploading
(2AH) or downloading (28H) custom halftone patterns (02H)
and gamma vectors (03H) should work, but require
implementing the SANE Option-Value code to allow the user to
create the tables to be uploaded to the scanner. No support
for Mainte- nance Data (80H) is planned as this
functionality is more suited to a stand-alone utility to be
used by a technician when replacing the lamp or ADF unit.
Nor is support for reading or changing IPU (93H) paramters
and adjustments planned, since my IS450 lacks such a unit.
The 31-byte Auto Photo/Letter struct and 21-byte Dynamic
threshold struct are docu- mented in the hs2p-scsi.h file
should someone wish to use their IPU for image data
processing.</p>
