<p>AMCLEANUP(8) System Administration Commands
AMCLEANUP(8)</p>

<p>NAME amcleanup - run the Amanda cleanup process after a
failure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amcleanup [-k] [-p] [-v] config</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amcleanup generates the Amanda Mail Report
and updates the Amanda databases after a system failure on a
tape server host. This cleanup process is normally done
automatically as part of the amdump program, but if amdump
cannot complete for some reason (usually because of a tape
server host crash), amcleanup must be run some time later
(usually during system boot).</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -k Kill all process listed in the log file are
their child. if there is no log file, then kill all amdump
and amflush process and their child.</p>

<p>-p Do the cleanup only if all process listed in the log
file are already terminated.</p>

<p>-v Generate verbose output.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example runs the Amanda cleanup process by
hand after a failure. % amcleanup daily</p>

<p>Putting the following line in a system boot script (e.g.
/etc/rc.local) runs the Amanda cleanup process as part of
the reboot, eliminating the need to run it by hand.
/usr/local/sbin/amcleanup daily</p>

<p>If nothing needs to be done, amcleanup exits normally
with the message: amcleanup: no unprocessed logfile to clean
up.</p>
