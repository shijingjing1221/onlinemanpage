<p>NAME sieved - Sieve script binary dump tool for the
Dovecot secure IMAP server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sieved [-x &quot;extension extension ...&quot;]
sieve-binary [out-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sieved command is part of the Pigeonhole
Sieve implementation for the Dovecot secure IMAP server.
Sieve (RFC 5228) is a simple and highly extensible language
for filtering e-mail messages. It can be imple- mented for
any type of mail access protocol, mail architecture and
operating system. The language cannot execute external
programs and in its basic form it does not provide the means
to cause infinite loops, making it suitable for running
securely on mail servers where mail users have no permission
run arbitrary programs.</p>

<p>Using the sieved command, Sieve binaries, which are
produced for instance by sievec(1), can be transformed into
a human-readable textual representation. This can provide
valuable insight in how the Sieve script is executed. This
is also particularly useful to view corrupt binaries that
can result from bugs in the Sieve implementation. This tool
is intended mainly for development purposes, so normally
system administrators and users will not need to use this
tool.</p>

<p>The sieve-binary argument specifies the Sieve binary
file that needs to be dumped. The optional out-file argument
specifies where the output must be written. If omitted, the
output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>The format of the output is not explained here in
detail, but it should be relatively easy to understand. The
Sieve binaries comprise a set of data blocks, each of which
can contain arbitrary data. For the base language
implementation two blocks are used: the first containing a
specification of all required language extensions and the
second con- taining the main Sieve program. Compiled Sieve
programs are represented as flat byte code and therefore the
dump of the main program is a dis- assembly listing of the
interpreter operations. Extensions can define new operations
and use additional blocks. Therefore, the output of sieved
depends greatly on the language extensions used when
compiling the binary.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -x &quot;extension extension ...&quot; Set the
available extensions. The parameter is a space-separated
list of the active extensions. By prepending the extension
iden- tifiers with + or -, extensions can be included or
excluded rel- ative to the default set of extensions. If no
extensions have a + or - prefix, only those extensions that
are explicitly listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions
are ignored and a warning is produced. By default, all
supported extensions are available, except for deprecated
extensions or those that are still under development.</p>

<p>For example -x &quot;+imapflags -enotify&quot; will
enable the deprecated imapflags extension along with all
extensions that are available by default, except for the
enotify extension.</p>
