<p>XmStringByteCompare(library call)
XmStringByteCompare(library call)</p>

<p>NAME XmStringByteCompare A compound string function that
indicates the results of a byte-by-byte comparison</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; Boolean
XmStringByteCompare( XmString s1, XmString s2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function is obsolete and exists for
compatibility with previous releases. XmStringByteCompare
returns a Boolean indicating the results of a byte-by-byte
comparison of two compound strings.</p>

<p>In general, if two compound strings are created with the
same (char *) string using XmStringCreateLocalized in the
same language environment, the compound strings compare as
equal. If two compound strings are created with the same
(char *) string and the same font list element tag set other
than XmFONTLIST_DEFAULT_TAG using XmStringCreate, the
strings compare as equal.</p>

<p>In some cases, once a compound string is put into a
widget, that string is converted into an internal form to
allow faster processing. Part of the conversion process
strips out unnecessary or redundant information. If an
application then does an XtGetValues to retrieve a compound
string from a widget (specifically, Label and all of its
subclasses), it is not guaranteed that the compound string
returned is byte-for-byte the same as the string given to
the widget originally.</p>

<p>s1 Specifies a compound string to be compared with
s2</p>

<p>s2 Specifies a compound string to be compared with
s1</p>

<p>RETURN Returns True if two compound strings are
identical byte-by-byte.</p>
