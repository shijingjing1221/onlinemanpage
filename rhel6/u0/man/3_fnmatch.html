<p>FNMATCH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FNMATCH(3)</p>

<p>NAME fnmatch - match filename or pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fnmatch.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fnmatch() function checks whether the
string argument matches the pattern argument, which is a
shell wildcard pattern.</p>

<p>The flags argument modifies the behavior; it is the
bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:</p>

<p>FNM_NOESCAPE If this flag is set, treat backslash as an
ordinary character, instead of an escape character.</p>

<p>FNM_PATHNAME If this flag is set, match a slash in
string only with a slash in pattern and not by an asterisk
(*) or a question mark (?) metacharacter, nor by a bracket
expression ([]) containing a slash.</p>

<p>FNM_PERIOD If this flag is set, a leading period in
string has to be matched exactly by a period in pattern. A
period is considered to be leading if it is the first
character in string, or if both FNM_PATHNAME is set and the
period immediately follows a slash.</p>

<p>FNM_FILE_NAME This is a GNU synonym for
FNM_PATHNAME.</p>

<p>FNM_LEADING_DIR If this flag (a GNU extension) is set,
the pattern is considered to be matched if it matches an
initial segment of string which is followed by a slash. This
flag is mainly for the internal use of glibc and is only
implemented in certain cases.</p>

<p>FNM_CASEFOLD If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the
pattern is matched case-insensitively.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Zero if string matches pattern, FNM_NOMATCH
if there is no match or another non-zero value if there is
an error.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.2. The FNM_FILE_NAME,
FNM_LEADING_DIR, and FNM_CASEFOLD flags are GNU
extensions.</p>
