<p>XtGetSelectionValue(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtGetSelectionValue(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtGetSelectionValue, XtGetSelectionValues - obtain
selection values</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtGetSelectionValue(Widget w, Atom
selection, Atom target, XtSe- lectionCallbackProc callback,
XtPointer client_data, Time time);</p>

<p>void XtGetSelectionValues(Widget w, Atom selection, Atom
*targets, int count, XtSelectionCallbackProc callback,
XtPointer client_data, Time time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS callback Specifies the callback procedure that
is to be called when the selection value has been
obtained.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies the argument that is to be passed
to the specified procedure when it is called.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies the client data (one for each
target type) that is passed to the callback procedure when
it is called for that target.</p>

<p>count Specifies the length of the targets and
client_data lists.</p>

<p>selection Specifies the particular selection desired
(that is, primary or secondary).</p>

<p>target Specifies the type of the information that is
needed about the selection.</p>

<p>targets Specifies the types of information that is
needed about the selection.</p>

<p>time Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
selection value is desired.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget that is making the request.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtGetSelectionValue function requests
the value of the selection that has been converted to the
target type. The specified callback will be called some time
after XtGetSelectionValue is called; in fact, it may be
called before or after XtGetSelectionValue returns.</p>

<p>The XtGetSelectionValues function is similar to
XtGetSelectionValue except that it takes a list of target
types and a list of client data and obtains the current
value of the selection converted to each of the targets. The
effect is as if each target were specified in a separate
call to XtGetSelectionValue. The callback is called once
with the cor- responding client data for each target.
XtGetSelectionValues does guarantee that all the conversions
will use the same selection value because the ownership of
the selection cannot change in the middle of the list, as
would be when calling XtGetSelectionValue repeatedly.</p>
