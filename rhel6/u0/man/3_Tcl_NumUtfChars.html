<p>DESCRIPTION These routines convert between UTF-8 strings
and Tcl_UniChars. A Tcl_UniChar is a Unicode character
represented as an unsigned, fixed- size quantity. A UTF-8
character is a Unicode character represented as a
varying-length sequence of up to TCL_UTF_MAX bytes. A
multibyte UTF-8 sequence consists of a lead byte followed by
some number of trail bytes.</p>

<p>TCL_UTF_MAX is the maximum number of bytes that it takes
to represent one Unicode character in the UTF-8
representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharToUtf stores the Tcl_UniChar ch as a UTF-8
string in start- ing at buf. The return value is the number
of bytes stored in buf.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfToUniChar reads one UTF-8 character starting at
src and stores it as a Tcl_UniChar in *chPtr. The return
value is the number of bytes read from src. The caller must
ensure that the source buffer is long enough such that this
routine does not run off the end and dereference
non-existent or random memory; if the source buffer is known
to be null-terminated, this will not happen. If the input is
not in proper UTF-8 format, Tcl_UtfToUniChar will store the
first byte of src in *chPtr as a Tcl_UniChar between 0x0000
and 0x00ff and return 1.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharToUtfDString converts the given Unicode
string to UTF-8, storing the result in a previously
initialized Tcl_DString. You must specify uniLength, the
length of the given Unicode string. The return value is a
pointer to the UTF-8 representation of the Unicode string.
Storage for the return value is appended to the end of the
Tcl_DString.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString converts the given UTF-8 string
to Unicode, storing the result in the previously initialized
Tcl_DString. In the argument length, you may either specify
the length of the given UTF-8 string in bytes or -1 , in
which case Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString uses strlen to calculate
the length. The return value is a pointer to the Unicode
representation of the UTF-8 string. Storage for the return
value is appended to the end of the Tcl_DString. The Unicode
string is terminated with a Unicode null character.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharLen corresponds to strlen for Unicode
characters. It accepts a null-terminated Unicode string and
returns the number of Uni- code characters (not bytes) in
that string.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharNcmp and Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp correspond to
strncmp and strn- casecmp, respectively, for Unicode
characters. They accept two null- terminated Unicode strings
and the number of characters to compare. Both strings are
assumed to be at least numChars characters long.
Tcl_UniCharNcmp compares the two strings
character-by-character according to the Unicode character
ordering. It returns an integer greater than, equal to, or
less than 0 if the first string is greater than, equal to,
or less than the second string respectively.
Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp is the Unicode case insensitive
version.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharCaseMatch is the Unicode equivalent to
Tcl_StringCaseMatch. It accepts a null-terminated Unicode
string, a Unicode pattern, and a boolean value specifying
whether the match should be case sensitive and returns
whether the string matches the pattern.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfNcmp corresponds to strncmp for UTF-8 strings. It
accepts two null-terminated UTF-8 strings and the number of
characters to compare. (Both strings are assumed to be at
least numChars characters long.) Tcl_UtfNcmp compares the
two strings character-by-character according to the Unicode
character ordering. It returns an integer greater than,
equal to, or less than 0 if the first string is greater
than, equal to, or less than the second string
respectively.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfNcasecmp corresponds to strncasecmp for UTF-8
strings. It is similar to Tcl_UtfNcmp except comparisons
ignore differences in case when comparing upper, lower or
title case characters.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfCharComplete returns 1 if the source UTF-8 string
src of length bytes is long enough to be decoded by
Tcl_UtfToUniChar, or 0 otherwise. This function does not
guarantee that the UTF-8 string is properly formed. This
routine is used by procedures that are operating on a byte
at a time and need to know if a full Tcl_UniChar has been
seen.</p>

<p>Tcl_NumUtfChars corresponds to strlen for UTF-8 strings.
It returns the number of Tcl_UniChars that are represented
by the UTF-8 string src. The length of the source string is
length bytes. If the length is negative, all bytes up to the
first null byte are used.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfFindFirst corresponds to strchr for UTF-8
strings. It returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the
Tcl_UniChar ch in the null-ter- minated UTF-8 string src.
The null terminator is considered part of the UTF-8
string.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfFindLast corresponds to strrchr for UTF-8
strings. It returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the
Tcl_UniChar ch in the null-termi- nated UTF-8 string src.
The null terminator is considered part of the UTF-8
string.</p>

<p>Given src, a pointer to some location in a UTF-8 string,
Tcl_UtfNext returns a pointer to the next UTF-8 character in
the string. The caller must not ask for the next character
after the last character in the string if the string is not
terminated by a null character.</p>

<p>Given src, a pointer to some location in a UTF-8 string
(or to a null byte immediately following such a string),
Tcl_UtfPrev returns a pointer to the closest preceding byte
that starts a UTF-8 character. This function will not back
up to a position before start, the start of the UTF-8
string. If src was already at start, the return value will
be start.</p>

<p>Tcl_UniCharAtIndex corresponds to a C string array
dereference or the Pascal Ord() function. It returns the
Tcl_UniChar represented at the specified character (not
byte) index in the UTF-8 string src. The source string must
contain at least index characters. Behavior is undefined if
a negative index is given.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfAtIndex returns a pointer to the specified
character (not byte) index in the UTF-8 string src. The
source string must contain at least index characters. This
is equivalent to calling Tcl_UtfNext index times. If a
negative index is given, the return pointer points to the
first character in the source string.</p>

<p>Tcl_UtfBackslash is a utility procedure used by several
of the Tcl com- mands. It parses a backslash sequence and
stores the properly formed UTF-8 character represented by
the backslash sequence in the output buffer dst. At most
TCL_UTF_MAX bytes are stored in the buffer. Tcl_UtfBackslash
modifies *readPtr to contain the number of bytes in the
backslash sequence, including the backslash character. The
return value is the number of bytes stored in the output
buffer.</p>

<p>See the Tcl manual entry for information on the valid
backslash sequences. All of the sequences described in the
Tcl manual entry are supported by Tcl_UtfBackslash.</p>
