<p>TPM Management - tpm_setenable</p>

<p>NAME tpm_setenable - change TPM enable states</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_setenable [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_setenable reports the status of the TPM
s flags regarding the enable state of the TPM. This is the
default behavior and also accessible via the --status
option. Requesting a report of this status prompts for the
owner password. The --enable option changes the system s TPM
to the enabled state (via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API). This
operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent.
The --disable option (via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API)
changes the systems TPM to the disabled state. This
operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent.
A disabled TPM is essentially off and does not allow a
tpm_takeownership to occur. The --force option overrides the
owner password prompt and relies on physical presence for
the operation authorization (via the TPM_PhysicalEnable and
TPM_PhysicalDisable APIs). The --enable, --disable, and
--status options are mutually exclusive and the last one on
the command line will be carried out.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command usage info.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display command version info.</p>

<p>-l, --log [none|error|info|debug] Set logging level.</p>

<p>-u, --unicode Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to
comply with applications using TSS popup boxes</p>

<p>-s, --status Report the status of flags regarding the
TPM enable states.</p>

<p>-e, --enable Make the TPM enabled. Operation is
persistent and prompts for owner authorization.</p>

<p>-d, --disable Make the TPM disabled. Operation is
persistent and prompts for owner authorization.</p>

<p>-f, --force Overrides the prompt for owner authorization
and uses physical presence to authorize the action.</p>

<p>-z, --well-known Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as
owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead
of prompting for an owner password.</p>
