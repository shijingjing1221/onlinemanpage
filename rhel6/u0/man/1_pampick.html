<p>NAME pampick - pick images out of a multi-image Netpbm
image stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pampick</p>

<p>image_sequence_number ...</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pampick reads a PNM or PAM image stream as input. It
picks certain images from the stream and copies them to a
new image stream on Stan- dard Output.</p>

<p>You identify the images to pick by sequence number
within the stream. Each image_sequence_number is a decimal
sequence number, with zero meaning the first image.</p>

<p>The arguments must be in increasing order, without
duplicates. The results are undefined if they are not.
(There are a number of enhance- ments that might be made in
future releases that would make whatever pampick does today
when you break this rule change). pampick outputs the images
in the same order as they appear in the input. If you spec-
ify no sequence numbers, pampick outputs nothing. If you
specify a sequence number that is beyond what is in the
input, pampick fails with an error message to that
effect.</p>

<p>pampick always reads the entire input stream. (This is
helpful when the input stream is a pipe and whatever is
feeding the pipe would be upset if it filled up or
broke).</p>

<p>To see how many images, and what kind, are in a stream,
use pamfile.</p>

<p>To extract all the images in a stream into separate
named files, use pamsplit.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pamfile(1), pamsplit(1), pnm(1), pam(1), cat
man page</p>

2005);</p>
