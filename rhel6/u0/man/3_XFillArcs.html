<p>XFillRectangle(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XFillRectangle(3)</p>

<p>NAME XFillRectangle, XFillRectangles, XFillPolygon,
XFillArc, XFillArcs - fill rectangles, polygons, or arcs</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XFillRectangle(Display *display, Drawable d,
GC gc, int x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int
height);</p>

<p>int XFillRectangles(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
XRectangle *rectangles, int nrectangles);</p>

<p>int XFillPolygon(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc,
XPoint *points, int npoints, int shape, int mode);</p>

<p>int XFillArc(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int x,
int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, int angle1,
int angle2);</p>

<p>int XFillArcs(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, XArc
*arcs, int narcs);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS angle1 Specifies the start of the arc relative
to the three-oclock position from the center, in units of
degrees * 64.</p>

<p>angle2 Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative
to the start of the arc, in units of degrees * 64.</p>

<p>arcs Specifies an array of arcs.</p>

<p>d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the coordinate mode. You can pass
CoordModeOrigin or CoordModePrevious.</p>

<p>narcs Specifies the number of arcs in the array.</p>

<p>npoints Specifies the number of points in the array.</p>

<p>nrectangles Specifies the number of rectangles in the
array.</p>

<p>points Specifies an array of points.</p>

<p>rectangles Specifies an array of rectangles.</p>

<p>shape Specifies a shape that helps the server to improve
perfor- mance. You can pass Complex, Convex, or
Nonconvex.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height, which are the
dimensions of the rectangle to be filled or the major and
minor axes of the arc.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
to the origin of the drawable and specify the upper-left
corner of the rectangle.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles
functions fill the specified rectangle or rectangles as if a
four-point FillPolygon protocol request were specified for
each rectangle:</p>

<p>[x,y] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height]</p>

<p>Each function uses the x and y coordinates, width and
height dimen- sions, and GC you specify.</p>

<p>XFillRectangles fills the rectangles in the order listed
in the array. For any given rectangle, XFillRectangle and
XFillRectangles do not draw a pixel more than once. If
rectangles intersect, the intersecting pix- els are drawn
multiple times.</p>

<p>Both functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fill- style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin,
clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. They also use these GC
mode-dependent components: foreground, back- ground, tile,
stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-ori-
gin.</p>

<p>XFillRectangle and XFillRectangles can generate
BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>XFillPolygon fills the region closed by the specified
path. The path is closed automatically if the last point in
the list does not coincide with the first point.
XFillPolygon does not draw a pixel of the region more than
once. CoordModeOrigin treats all coordinates as relative to
the origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordinates
after the first as relative to the previous point.</p>

<p>Depending on the specified shape, the following
occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; If shape is Complex, the path may
self-intersect. Note that con- tiguous coincident points in
the path are not treated as self- intersection.</p>

<p>&middot; If shape is Convex, for every pair of points
inside the polygon, the line segment connecting them does
not intersect the path. If known by the client, specifying
Convex can improve performance. If you specify Convex for a
path that is not convex, the graphics results are
undefined.</p>

<p>&middot; If shape is Nonconvex, the path does not
self-intersect, but the shape is not wholly convex. If known
by the client, specifying Nonconvex instead of Complex may
improve performance. If you specify Nonconvex for a
self-intersecting path, the graphics results are
undefined.</p>

<p>The fill-rule of the GC controls the filling behavior of
self-inter- secting polygons.</p>

<p>This function uses these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fill- style, fill-rule, subwindow-mode,
clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It also uses
these GC mode-dependent components: fore- ground,
background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-
stipple-y-origin.</p>

<p>XFillPolygon can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch,
and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>For each arc, XFillArc or XFillArcs fills the region
closed by the infinitely thin path described by the
specified arc and, depending on the arc-mode specified in
the GC, one or two line segments. For Arc- Chord, the single
line segment joining the endpoints of the arc is used. For
ArcPieSlice, the two line segments joining the endpoints of
the arc with the center point are used. XFillArcs fills the
arcs in the order listed in the array. For any given arc,
XFillArc and XFil- lArcs do not draw a pixel more than once.
If regions intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn
multiple times.</p>

<p>Both functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fill- style, arc-mode, subwindow-mode,
clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. They also use
these GC mode-dependent components: fore- ground,
background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-
stipple-y-origin.</p>

<p>XFillArc and XFillArcs can generate BadDrawable, BadGC,
and BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
