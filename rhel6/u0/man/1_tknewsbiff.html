<p>TKNEWSBIFF(1) TKNEWSBIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME tknewsbiff - pop up a window when news appears</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tknewsbiff [ server or config-file ]</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION tknewsbiff pops up a window when there is
unread news in your favorite newsgroups and removes the
window after youve read the news. tknewsb- iff can
optionally play a sound, start your newsreader, etc.</p>

<p>SELECTING NEWSGROUPS By default, the configuration file
~/.tknewsbiff describes how tknewsb- iff behaves. The syntax
observes the usual Tcl rules - however, even if you don t
know Tcl, all but the most esoteric configurations will be
obvious.</p>

<p>Each newsgroup (or set of newsgroups) to be watched is
described by using the &quot;watch&quot; command. For
example:</p>

<p>watch dc.dining watch nist.* watch comp.unix.wizard
-threshold 3 watch *.sources.* -threshold 20</p>

<p>For each newsgroup pattern, any newsgroup that matches
it and which you are subscribed to (according to your newsrc
file) is eligible for reporting. By default, tknewsbiff
reports on the newsgroup if there is at least one unread
article. The &quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the thresh-
old to the following number. For example, &quot;-threshold
3&quot; means there must be at least three articles unread
before tknewsbiff will report the newsgroup.</p>

<p>If no watch commands are given (or no configuration file
exists), all groups which are subscribed to are watched.</p>

<p>To suppress newsgroups that would otherwise be reported,
use the &quot;ignore&quot; command. For example, the
following matches all comp.* and nist.* newgroups except for
nist.posix or .d (discussion) groups:</p>

<p>watch comp.* watch nist.* ignore nist.posix.* ignore
*.d</p>

<p>The flag &quot;-new&quot; describes a command to be
executed when the newsgroup is first reported as having
unread news. For example, the following lines invoke the
UNIX command &quot;play&quot; to play a sound.</p>

<p>watch dc.dining -new &quot;exec play
/usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot; watch rec.auto* -new
&quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;</p>

<p>You can cut down on the verbosity of actions by defining
procedures. For example, if you have many -new flags that
all play sound files, you could define a sound procedure.
This would allow the -new specification to be much
shorter.</p>

<p>proc play {sound} { exec play
/usr/local/sounds/$sound.au }</p>

<p>watch dc.dining -new &quot;play yumyum&quot; watch
rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;</p>

<p>As an aside, you can put an &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end
of an &quot;exec&quot; command to get commands to execute
asynchronously. However, its probably not a good idea to do
this when playing sound files anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;newsgroup&quot; is a read-only variable which
contains the name of the newsgroup that is being reported.
This is useful when the action is triggered by a pattern.
For example, the following line could run the newsgroup name
through a speech synthesizer:</p>

<p>watch * -new { exec play herald.au exec speak &quot;New
news has arrived in $newsgroup.&quot; }</p>

<p>The flag &quot;-display&quot; describes a command to be
executed every time the newsgroup is reported as having
unread news. The special command &quot;dis- play&quot; is
the default command. It schedules $newsgroup to be written
to tknewsbiffs display when it is rewritten. For example, by
explicitly providing a -display flag that omits the display
command, you can dis- able the display of newsgroups that
are already reported via -new.</p>

<p>watch dc.dining -new {exec play yumyum.au} -display
{}</p>

<p>If you want to execute an action repeatedly and still
display the news- group in the default manner, explicitly
invoke the display command via the -display flag. For
example:</p>

<p>watch *security* -display { exec play red-alert.au
display }</p>

<p>Actions associated with the -new and -display flags are
executed only once for each matching newsgroup. The command
executed is the one associated with the first pattern in the
configuration file that matches and observes the given
threshold.</p>

<p>Any command that is simply listed in the configuration
file is executed each time before the update loop in
tknewsbiff. The reserved (but user-defined) procedure
&quot;user&quot; is run immediately after the newsgroups are
scheduled to be written to the display and before they are
actually written.</p>

<p>For example, suppose unread articles appear in several
rec.auto groups and you play the same sound for each one. To
prevent playing the sound several times in a row, make the
-new command simply set a flag. In the user procedure, play
the sound if the flag is set (and then reset the flag).</p>

<p>The user procedure could also be used to start a
newsreader. This would avoid the possibility of starting
multiple newsreaders just because multiple newsgroups
contained unread articles. (A check should, of course, be
made to make sure that a newsreader is not already
running.)</p>

<p>MORE VARIABLES The following example lines show
variables that can affect the behavior of tknewsbiff</p>

<p>set delay 120 set server news.nist.gov set
server_timeout 60 set newsrc ~/.newsrc set width 40 set
height 20 set active_file /usr/news/lib/active</p>

<p>tknewsbiff alternates between checking for unread news
and sleeping (kind of like many undergraduates). The
&quot;delay&quot; variable describes how many seconds to
sleep.</p>

<p>The &quot;server&quot; variable names an NNTP
news-server. The default is &quot;news&quot;. The
&quot;server&quot; variable is only used if the
&quot;active_file&quot; vari- able is not set.</p>

<p>The &quot;server_timeout&quot; variable describes how
how many seconds to wait for a response from the server
before giving up. -1 means wait forever or until the server
itself times out. The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>The &quot;newsrc&quot; variable describes the name of
your .newsrc file. By default, tknewsbiff looks in your home
directory for a newsrc file. A server-specific newsrc is
used if found. For example, if you have set server to
&quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then tknewsbiff looks for
~/.newsrc- cubit.nist.gov. (This is the Emacs gnus
convention - which is very convenient when you read news
from multiple servers.) If there is no server-specific
newsrc, tknewsbiff uses ~/.newsrc.</p>

<p>The &quot;width&quot; variable describes the width that
tknewsbiff will use to display information. If any newsgroup
names are long enough, they will be truncated so that the
article counts can still be shown. You can manually resize
the window to see what was truncated. However, if your
configuration file sets the width variable, the window will
be restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff
checks for unread news and updates its display.</p>

<p>The &quot;height&quot; variable describes the maximum
height that tknewsbiff will use to display information. If
fewer newsgroups are reported, tknewsb- iff will shrink the
window appropriately. You can manually resize the window but
if your configuration file sets the height variable, the
window will be restored to that size the next time that
tknewsbiff checks for unread news and updates its
display.</p>

<p>The &quot;active_file&quot; variable describes the name
of the news active file. If set, the active file is read
directly in preference to using NNTP (even if the
&quot;server&quot; variable is set). This is particularly
useful for testing out new configuration files since you can
edit a fake active file and then click button 2 to
immediately see how tknewsbiff responds (see BUTTONS
below).</p>

<p>If the environment variable DOTDIR is set, then its
value is used as a directory in which to find all dotfiles
instead of from the home direc- tory. In particular, this
affects the tknewsbiff configuration file and the .newsrc
file (assuming the newsrc variable is not set explic-
itly).</p>

<p>WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS To watch multiple
servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times. (Since you need
different .newsrc files and the servers have different
newsgroups and article numbers anyway, there is no point in
trying to do this in a single process.)</p>

<p>You can point tknewsbiff at a different server with an
appropriate argument. The argument is tried both as a
configuration file name and as a suffix to the string
&quot;~/.tknewsbiff-&quot;. So if you want to watch the
server &quot;kidney&quot;, store the tknewsbiff
configuration information in ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;. The
following two commands will both use that configuration
file.</p>

<p>tknewsbiff kidney tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney</p>

<p>In both cases, the actual server to contact is set by
the value of the server variable in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>If no configuration file is found, the argument is used
as the server to contact. This allows tknewsbiff to be run
with no preparation what- soever.</p>

<p>If the argument is the special keyword
&quot;active&quot; (or ends in &quot;/active&quot;), it is
used as the name of an active file. This is in turn used to
ini- tialize the variable &quot;active_file&quot; so that
tknewsbiff reads from the active file directly rather than
using NNTP.</p>

<p>Creating your own active file is a convenient way of
testing your con- figuration file. For example, after
running the following command, you can repeatedly edit your
active file and trigger the update-now command (either by
pressing button 2 or setting the delay variable very low) to
see how tknewsbiff responds.</p>

<p>The active file must follow the format of a real active
file. The for- mat is one newsgroup per line. After the
newsgroup name is the number of the highest article, the
lowest article. Lastly is the letter y or m. m means the
newsgroup is moderated. y means posting is allowed.</p>

<p>WINDOW When unread news is found, a window is popped up.
The window lists the names of the newsgroups and the number
of unread articles in each (unless suppressed by the
-display flag). When there is no longer any unread news, the
window disappears (although the process continues to
run).</p>

<p>BUTTONS Button or key bindings may be assigned by bind
commands. Feel free to change them. The default bind
commands are:</p>

<p>bind .list &lt;1&gt; help bind .list &lt;2&gt;
update-now bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow</p>

<p>By default button 1 (left) is bound to &quot;help&quot;.
The help command causes tknewsbiff to pop up a help
window.</p>

<p>By default, button 2 (middle) is bound to
&quot;update-now&quot;. The update-now command causes
tknewsbiff to immediately check for unread news. If your
news server is slow or maintains a very large number of
news- groups, or you have a large number of patterns in your
configuration file, tknewsbiff can take considerable time
before actually updating the window.</p>

<p>By default, button 3 (right) is bound to
&quot;unmapwindow&quot;. The unmapwin- dow command causes
tknewsbiff to remove the window from the display until the
next time it finds unread news. (The mapwindow command
causes tknewsbiff to restore the window.)</p>

<p>As an example, here is a binding to pop up an xterm and
run rn when you hold down the shift key and press button 1
in the listing window.</p>

<p>bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; { exec xterm -e rn &amp;
}</p>

<p>Here is a similar binding. However it tells rn to look
only at the newsgroup that is under the mouse when you
pressed it. (The &quot;dis- play_list&quot; variable is
described later in this man page.)</p>

<p>bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; { exec xterm -e rn [lindex
$display_list [.list nearest %y]] &amp; }</p>

<p>OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES Built-in commands already
mentioned are: watch, ignore, display, help, update-now,
unmapwindow, and mapwindow.</p>

<p>Any Tcl and Tk command can also be given. In particular,
the list of newsgroups is stored in the list widget
&quot;.list&quot;, and the scroll bar is stored in the
scrollbar widget &quot;.scroll&quot;. So for example, if you
want to change the foreground and background colors of the
newsgroup list, you can say:</p>

<p>.list config -bg honeydew1 -fg orchid2</p>

<p>These can also be controlled by the X resource database
as well. How- ever, the configuration file allows
arbitrarily complex commands to be evaluated rather than
simple assignments.</p>

<p>Certain Tcl/Tk commands can disrupt proper function of
tknewsbiff. These will probably be obvious to anyone who
knows enough to give these commands in the first place. As a
simple example, the program assumes the font in the list box
is of fixed width. The newsgroups will likely not align if
you use a variable-width font.</p>

<p>The following variables are accessible and can be used
for esoteric uses. All other variables are private. Private
variables and commands begin with &quot;_&quot; so you dont
need to worry about accidental collisions.</p>

<p>The array &quot;db&quot; is a database which maintains
information about read and unread news. db($newsgroup,hi) is
the highest article that exists. db($newsgroup,seen) is the
highest article that you have read.</p>

<p>A number of lists maintain interesting information.
&quot;active_list&quot; is a list of known newsgroups.
&quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of newsgroups that have been
seen so far as the -new and -display flags are being pro-
cessed. &quot;previous_seen_list&quot; is
&quot;seen_list&quot; from the previous cycle.
&quot;ignore_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup patterns to
ignore. &quot;watch_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup
patterns to watch. &quot;dis- play_list&quot; is the list of
newsgroup will be displayed at the next opportunity.</p>

<p>UPDATING YOUR FILES tknewsbiff automatically rereads
your configuration file each time it wakes up to check for
unread news. To force tknewsbiff to reread the file
immediately (such as if you are testing a new configuration
or have just modified your newsrc file), press button 2 in
the display (see BUTTONS above).</p>

<p>CAVEATS tknewsbiff defines the number of unread articles
as the highest exist- ing article minus the highest article
that youve read. So if youve read the last article in the
newsgroup but no others, tknewsbiff thinks there are no
unread articles. (Its impossible to do any better by reading
the active file and it would be very time consuming to do
this more accurately via NNTP since servers provide no
efficient way of reporting their own holes in the
newsgroups.) Fortunately, this defi- nition is considered a
feature by most people. It allows you to read articles and
then mark them &quot;unread&quot; but not have tknewsbiff
continue telling you that they are unread.</p>

<p>UNWARRANTED CONCERNS Your news administrator may wonder
if many people using tknewsbiff severely impact an NNTP
server. In fact, the impact is negligible even when the
delay is very low. To gather all the information it needs,
tknewsbiff uses a single NNTP query - it just asks for the
active file. The NNTP server does no computation,
formatting, etc, it just sends the file. All the interesting
processing happens locally in the tknewsbiff program
itself.</p>
