<p>NAME sg_verify - invoke SCSI VERIFY command(s) on a
block device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_verify [--bpc=BPC] [--count=COUNT] [--dpo]
[--help] [--lba=LBA] [--verbose] [--version]
[--vrprotect=VRP] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends one or more SCSI VERIFY commands to
DEVICE. It is the 10 byte VERIFY command defined for block
devices (see SBC-2 at http://www.t10.org). Verify starts at
the logical block address given by the --lba=LBA option and
continues for --count=COUNT blocks. No more than --bpc=BPC
blocks are verified by each VERIFY command so if neces- sary
multiple VERIFY commands are sent. No news is good news
(i.e. if there are no verify errors detected no messages are
sent to stderr and the Unix return status is 0).</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The options are arranged in
alphabetical order based on the long option name.</p>

<p>-b, --bpc=BPC where BPC specifies the maximum number of
blocks that will be verified by a single SCSI VERIFY
command. The default value is 128 blocks which equates to 64
KB for a disk with 512 byte blocks. If BPC is less than
COUNT then multiple SCSI VERIFY com- mands are sent to the
device. For recent block devices (disks) this value may be
constrained by the maximum transfer length field in the
block limits VPD page.</p>

<p>-c, --count=COUNT where COUNT specifies the number of
blocks to verify. The default value is 1 . If COUNT is
greater than BPC (or its default value of 128) then multiple
SCSI VERIFY commands are sent to the device. The sg_readcap
utility can be used to find the maximum number of blocks
that a block device (e.g. a disk) has.</p>

<p>-d, --dpo disable page out changes the cache retention
priority of blocks read on the device s cache to the lowest
priority. This means that blocks read by other commands are
more likely to remain in the devices cache.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --lba=LBA where LBA specifies the logical block
address of the first block to start the verify operation.
LBA is assumed to be decimal unless prefixed by 0x or a
trailing h (see below). The default value is 0 (i.e. the
start of the device).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>-P, --vrprotect=VRP where VRP is the value in the
vrprotect field in the VERIFY com- mand cdb. It must be a
value between 0 and 7 inclusive. The default value is
zero.</p>

<p>NOTES Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suf- fixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>The amount of error correction and the number of retries
attempted before a block is considered defective are
controlled in part by the Verify Error Recovery mode page. A
note in the SBC-2 (draft) standard advises that to minimize
the number of checks (and hence have the most
&quot;sensitive&quot; verify check) do the following in that
mode page. Set the EER bit to 0, the PER bit to 1, the DTE
bit to 1, the DCR bit to 1, the verify retry count to 0 and
the verify error recovery timeout to 0. Mode pages can be
modified with the sginfo utility.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_verify is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
