<p>QSELECT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QSELECT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qselect - select batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qselect [-a [op]date_time][-A
account_string][-c [op]interval] [-h hold_list][-l
resource_list][-N name][-p [op]priority] [-q destination][-r
y|n][-s states][-u user_list]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To select a set of batch jobs is to return
the batch job_identifiers for each batch job that meets a
list of selection criteria. A set of batch jobs is selected
by a request to a batch server. The qselect utility is a
user-accessible batch client that requests the selection of
batch jobs.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the qselect utility shall
have returned a list of zero or more batch job_identifiers
that meet the criteria spec- ified by the options and
option-arguments presented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select batch jobs by sending a
Select Jobs Request to a batch server. The qselect utility
shall not exit until the server replies to each request
generated.</p>

<p>For each option presented to the qselect utility, the
utility shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as
described in the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall not restrict selection of
batch jobs except by authorization and as required by the
options presented to the util- ity.</p>

<p>When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional
op component to the option-argument, then op shall specify a
relation between the value of a certain batch job attribute
and the value component of the option-argument. If an op is
allowable on an option, then the descrip- tion of the option
letter indicates the op as either mandatory or optional.
Acceptable strings for the op component, and the relation
the string indicates, are shown in the following list:</p>

<p>.eq. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is equal to the value represented by the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.ge. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is greater than or equal to the value represented by the
option- argument.</p>

<p>.gt. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is greater than the value represented by the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.lt. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is less than the value represented by the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.le. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is less than or equal to the value represented by the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.ne. The value represented by the attribute of the batch
job is not equal to the value represented by the
option-argument.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qselect utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-a [op]date_time</p>

<p>Restrict selection to a specific time, or a range of
times.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Execution_Time attribute is related
to the Epoch equivalent of the local time expressed by the
value of the date_time component of the option-argument in
the manner indicated by the value of the op compo- nent of
the option-argument.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept a date_time component
of the option- argument that conforms to the syntax of the
time operand of the touch utility.</p>

<p>If the op component of the option-argument is not
presented to the qse- lect utility, the utility shall select
batch jobs for which the Execu- tion_Time attribute is equal
to the date_time component of the option- argument.</p>

<p>When comparing times, the qselect utility shall use the
following defi- nitions for the op component of the
option-argument:</p>

<p>.eq. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is equal to the time represented
by the date_time component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.ge. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is after or equal to the time
represented by the date_time component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.gt. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is after the time represented by
the date_time component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.lt. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is before the time represented by
the date_time component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.le. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is before or equal to the time
represented by the date_time component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.ne. The time represented by value of the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job is not equal to the time
represented by the date_time component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept the defined character
strings for the op component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>-A account_string</p>

<p>Restrict selection to the batch jobs charging a
specified account.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Account_Name attribute of the batch
job matchs the value of the account_string
option-argument.</p>

<p>The syntax of the account_string option-argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>-c [op]interval</p>

<p>Restrict selection to batch jobs within a range of
checkpoint intervals.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Checkpoint attribute relates to the
value of the interval component of the option-argument in
the manner indicated by the value of the op component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the op component of the option-argument is omitted,
the qselect utility shall select batch jobs for which the
value of the Checkpoint attribute is equal to the value of
the interval component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>When comparing checkpoint intervals, the qselect utility
shall use the following definitions for the op component of
the option-argument:</p>

<p>.eq. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job equals the value of the interval component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.ge. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job is greater than or equal to the value of the interval
component option-argument.</p>

<p>.gt. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job is greater than the value of the interval component
option-argu- ment.</p>

<p>.lt. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job is less than the value of the interval component
option-argument.</p>

<p>.le. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job is less than or equal to the value of the interval
component option- argument.</p>

<p>.ne. The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job does not equal the value of the interval component
option-argument.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept the defined character
strings for the op component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>The ordering relationship for the values of the interval
option-argu- ment is defined to be:</p>

<p>n.gt.s.gt.c=minutes.ge.c When comparing Checkpoint
attributes with an interval having the value of the single
character, only equality or inequality are valid com-
parisons.</p>

<p>-h hold_list Restrict selection to batch jobs that have
a specific type of hold.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Hold_Types attribute matches the
value of the hold_list option- argument.</p>

<p>The qselect -h option shall accept a value for the
hold_list option- argument that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable character set (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept a value for the
hold_list option-argu- ment that is a string of one or more
of the characters , s , or , or the single charactern.</p>

<p>Each unique character in the hold_list option-argument
of the qselect utility is defined as follows, each
representing a different hold type:</p>

<p>u USER</p>

<p>s SYSTEM</p>

<p>o OPERATOR</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
hold_list option-argu- ment, the duplicates shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall consider it an error if any
hold type other thannis combined with hold typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters ,,, ornwithin the hold_list option-argument.
The qselect utility shall permit the repetition of
characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to the
repeated characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other hold types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional hold types, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>-l resource_list</p>

<p>Restrict selection to batch jobs with specified resource
limits and attributes.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept a resource_list
option-argument with the following syntax:</p>

<p>resource_name op value [,,resource_name op value,,
...]</p>

<p>When comparing resource values, the qselect utility
shall use the fol- lowing definitions for the op component
of the option-argument:</p>

<p>.eq. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job equals the value of
the value compo- nent of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.ge. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job is greater than or
equal to the value of the value component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.gt. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job is greater than the
value of the value component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.lt. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job is less than the
value of the value component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.ne. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job does not equal the
value of the value component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>.le. The value of the resource of the same name in the
Resource_List attribute of the batch job is less than or
equal to the value of the value component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>When comparing the limit of a Resource_List attribute
with the value component of the option-argument, if the
limit, the value, or both are non-numeric, only equality or
inequality are valid comparisons.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the values of the resource_names listed in the
resource_list option-argument match the corresponding limits
of the Resource_List attribute of the batch job.</p>

<p>Limits of resource_names present in the Resource_List
attribute of the batch job that have no corresponding values
in the resource_list option-argument shall not be considered
when selecting batch jobs.</p>

<p>-N name Restrict selection to batch jobs with a
specified name.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Job_Name attribute matches the value
of the name option-argument. The string specified in the
name option-argument shall be passed, unin- terpreted, to
the server. This allows an implementation to match
&quot;wild- card&quot; patterns against batch job names.</p>

<p>An implementation shall describe in the conformance
document the format it supports for matching against the
Job_Name attribute.</p>

<p>-p [op]priority</p>

<p>Restrict selection to batch jobs of the specified
priority or range of priorities.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Priority attribute of the batch job
relates to the value of the priority component of the
option-argument in the manner indicated by the value of the
op component of the option-argument.</p>

<p>If the op component of the option-argument is omitted,
the qselect utility shall select batch jobs for which the
value of the Priority attribute of the batch job is equal to
the value of the priority compo- nent of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>When comparing priority values, the qselect utility
shall use the fol- lowing definitions for the op component
of the option-argument:</p>

<p>.eq. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job equals the value of the priority component of the
option-argument.</p>

<p>.ge. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job is greater than or equal to the value of the priority
component option- argument.</p>

<p>.gt. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job is greater than the value of the priority component
option-argument.</p>

<p>.lt. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job is less than the value of the priority component
option-argument.</p>

<p>.lt. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job is less than or equal to the value of the priority
component option- argument.</p>

<p>.ne. The value of the Priority attribute of the batch
job does not equal the value of the priority component
option-argument.</p>

<p>-q destination</p>

<p>Restrict selection to the specified batch queue or
server, or both.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs that
are located at the destination indicated by the value of the
destination option-argu- ment.</p>

<p>The destination defines a batch queue, a server, or a
batch queue at a server.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept an option-argument for
the -q option that conforms to the syntax for a destination.
If the -q option is not presented to the qselect utility,
the utility shall select batch jobs from all batch queues at
the default batch server.</p>

<p>If the option-argument describes only a batch queue, the
qselect util- ity shall select only batch jobs from the
batch queue of the specified name at the default batch
server. The means by which qselect determines the default
server is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If the option-argument describes only a batch server,
the qselect util- ity shall select batch jobs from all the
batch queues at that batch server.</p>

<p>If the option-argument describes both a batch queue and
a batch server, the qselect utility shall select only batch
jobs from the specified batch queue at the specified
server.</p>

<p>-r y|n Restrict selection to batch jobs with the
specified rerunability status.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
which the value of the Rerunable attribute of the batch job
matches the value of the option-argument.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept a value for the
option-argument that consists of either the single
characteryor the single charactern . The character
yrepresents the value TRUE, and the charactern represents
the value FALSE.</p>

<p>-s states Restrict selection to batch jobs in the
specified states.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept an option-argument that
consists of any combination of the characters,,,,, andt.</p>

<p>Conforming applications shall not repeat any character
in the option- argument. The qselect utility shall permit
the repetition of charac- ters in the option-argument, but
shall not assign additional meaning to repeated
characters.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall interpret the characters in
the states option-argument as follows:</p>

<p>e Represents the EXITING state.</p>

<p>q Represents the QUEUED state.</p>

<p>r Represents the RUNNING state.</p>

<p>t Represents the TRANSITING state.</p>

<p>h Represents the HELD state.</p>

<p>w Represents the WAITING state.</p>

<p>For each character in the states option-argument, the
qselect utility shall select batch jobs in the corresponding
state.</p>

<p>-u user_list Restrict selection to batch jobs owned by
the specified user names.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall select only the batch jobs of
those users specified in the user_list option-argument.</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept a user_list
option-argument that con- forms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>username[@host][,,username[@host],, ...]</p>

<p>The qselect utility shall accept only one user name that
is missing a corresponding host name. The qselect utility
shall accept only one user name per named host.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qse- lect:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example shows how a user might
use the qselect utility in conjunction with the qdel utility
to delete all of his or her jobs in the queued state without
affecting any jobs that are already running:</p>

<p>qdel $(qselect -s q)</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>qselect -s q || xargs qdel</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qselect utility allows users to acquire a
list of job identifiers that match user-specified selection
criteria. The list of identifiers returned by the qselect
utility conforms to the syntax of the batch job identifier
list processed by a utility such as qmove, qdel, and qrls.
The qselect utility is thus a powerful tool for causing
another batch system utility to act upon a set of jobs that
match a list of selection criteria.</p>

<p>The options of the qselect utility let the user apply a
number of use- ful filters for selecting jobs. Each option
further restricts the selection of jobs. Many of the
selection options allow the specifica- tion of a relational
operator. The FORTRAN-like syntax of the operator- that is,
&quot;.lt.&quot; - was chosen rather than the C-like
&quot;&lt;=&quot; meta-charac- ters.</p>

<p>The -a option allows users to restrict the selected jobs
to those that have been submitted (or altered) to wait until
a particular time. The time period is determined by the
argument of this option, which includes both a time and an
operator-it is thus possible to select jobs waiting until a
specific time, jobs waiting until after a certain time, or
those waiting for a time before the specified time.</p>

<p>The -A option allows users to restrict the selected jobs
to those that have been submitted (or altered) to charge a
particular account.</p>

<p>The -c option allows users to restrict the selected jobs
to those whose checkpointing interval falls within the
specified range.</p>

<p>The -l option allows users to select those jobs whose
resource limits fall within the range indicated by the value
of the option. For exam- ple, a user could select those jobs
for which the CPU time limit is greater than two hours.</p>

<p>The -N option allows users to select jobs by job name.
For instance, all the parts of a task that have been divided
in parallel jobs might be given the same name, and thus
manipulated as a group by means of this option.</p>

<p>The -q option allows users to select jobs in a specified
queue.</p>

<p>The -r option allows users to select only those jobs
with a specified rerun criteria. For instance, a user might
select only those jobs that can be rerun for use with the
qrerun utility.</p>

<p>The -s option allows users to select only those jobs
that are in a cer- tain state.</p>

<p>The -u option allows users to select jobs that have been
submitted to execute under a particular account.</p>

<p>The selection criteria provided by the options of the
qselect utility allow users to select jobs based on all the
appropriate attributes that can be assigned to jobs by the
qsub utility.</p>

<p>Historically, the qselect utility has not been a part of
existing prac- tice; it is an improvement that has been
introduced in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
