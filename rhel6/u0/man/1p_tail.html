<p>TAIL(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TAIL(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tail - copy the last part of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tail [-f][ -c number| -n number][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tail utility shall copy its input file
to the standard output beginning at a designated place.</p>

<p>Copying shall begin at the point in the file indicated
by the -c number or -n number options. The option-argument
number shall be counted in units of lines or bytes,
according to the options -n and -c. Both line and byte
counts start from 1.</p>

<p>Tails relative to the end of the file may be saved in an
internal buffer, and thus may be limited in length. Such a
buffer, if any, shall be no smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10
bytes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The tail utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c number The application shall ensure that the number
option-argument is a decimal integer whose sign affects the
location in the file, measured in bytes, to begin the
copying:</p>

<p>Sign Copying Starts + Relative to the beginning of the
file. - Relative to the end of the file. none Relative to
the end of the file.</p>

<p>The origin for counting shall be 1; that is, -c +1
represents the first byte of the file, -c -1 the last.</p>

<p>-f If the input file is a regular file or if the file
operand spec- ifies a FIFO, do not terminate after the last
line of the input file has been copied, but read and copy
further bytes from the input file when they become
available. If no file operand is specified and standard
input is a pipe, the -f option shall be ignored. If the
input file is not a FIFO, pipe, or regular file, it is
unspecified whether or not the -f option shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>-n number This option shall be equivalent to -c number,
except the start- ing location in the file shall be measured
in lines instead of bytes. The origin for counting shall be
1; that is, -n +1 repre- sents the first line of the file,
-n -1 the last.</p>

<p>If neither -c nor -n is specified, -n 10 shall be
assumed.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES If the -c option is specified, the input
file can contain arbitrary data; otherwise, the input file
shall be a text file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of tail:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The designated portion of the input file shall be
written to standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -c option should be used with
caution when the input is a text file containing multi-byte
characters; it may produce output that does not start on a
character boundary.</p>

<p>Although the input file to tail can be any type, the
results might not be what would be expected on some
character special device files or on file types not
described by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Since this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does
not specify the block size used when doing input, tail need
not read all of the data from devices that only perform
block transfers.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The -f option can be used to monitor the growth
of a file that is being written by some other process. For
example, the command:</p>

<p>tail -f fred</p>

<p>prints the last ten lines of the file fred, followed by
any lines that are appended to fred between the time tail is
initiated and killed. As another example, the command:</p>

<p>tail -f -c 15 fred</p>

<p>prints the last 15 bytes of the file fred, followed by
any bytes that are appended to fred between the time tail is
initiated and killed.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This version of tail was created to allow
conformance to the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The historical
-b option was omitted because of the general non-portability
of block-sized units of text. The -c option historically
meant &quot;characters&quot;, but this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 indicates that it means &quot;bytes&quot;. This
was selected to allow reasonable implementations when
multi-byte characters are pos- sible; it was not named -b to
avoid confusion with the historical -b.</p>

<p>The origin of counting both lines and bytes is 1,
matching all widespread historical implementations.</p>

<p>The restriction on the internal buffer is a compromise
between the his- torical System V implementation of 4096
bytes and the BSD 32768 bytes.</p>

<p>The -f option has been implemented as a loop that sleeps
for 1 second and copies any bytes that are available. This
is sufficient, but if more efficient methods of determining
when new data are available are developed, implementations
are encouraged to use them.</p>

<p>Historical documentation indicates that tail ignores the
-f option if the input file is a pipe (pipe and FIFO on
systems that support FIFOs). On BSD-based systems, this has
been true; on System V-based systems, this was true when
input was taken from standard input, but it did not ignore
the -f flag if a FIFO was named as the file operand. Since
the -f option is not useful on pipes and all historical
implementations ignore -f if no file operand is specified
and standard input is a pipe, this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires this behavior. However, since the -f
option is useful on a FIFO, this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 also requires that if standard input is a FIFO
or a FIFO is named, the -f option shall not be ignored.
Although histori- cal behavior does not ignore the -f option
for other file types, this is unspecified so that
implementations are allowed to ignore the -f option if it is
known that the file cannot be extended.</p>

<p>This was changed to the current form based on comments
noting that -c was almost never used without specifying a
number and that there was no need to specify -l if -n number
was given.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
