<p>NAME lvm - LVM2 tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvm [command | file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvm provides the command-line tools for
LVM2. A separate manual page describes each command in
detail.</p>

<p>If lvm is invoked with no arguments it presents a
readline prompt (assuming it was compiled with readline
support). LVM commands may be entered interactively at this
prompt with readline facilities including history and
command name and option completion. Refer to readline(3) for
details.</p>

<p>If lvm is invoked with argv[0] set to the name of a
specific LVM com- mand (for example by using a hard or soft
link) it acts as that com- mand.</p>

<p>On invocation, lvm requires that only the standard file
descriptors stdin, stdout and stderr are available. If
others are found, they get closed and messages are issued
warning about the leak.</p>

<p>Where commands take VG or LV names as arguments, the
full path name is optional. An LV called &quot;lvol0&quot;
in a VG called &quot;vg0&quot; can be specified as
&quot;vg0/lvol0&quot;. Where a list of VGs is required but
is left empty, a list of all VGs will be substituted. Where
a list of LVs is required but a VG is given, a list of all
the LVs in that VG will be substi- tuted. So &quot;lvdisplay
vg0&quot; will display all the LVs in &quot;vg0&quot;. Tags
can also be used - see addtag below.</p>

<p>One advantage of using the built-in shell is that
configuration infor- mation gets cached internally between
commands.</p>

<p>A file containing a simple script with one command per
line can also be given on the command line. The script can
also be executed directly if the first line is #! followed
by the absolute path of lvm.</p>

<p>BUILT-IN COMMANDS The following commands are built into
lvm without links normally being created in the filesystem
for them.</p>

<p>dumpconfig Display the configuration information after
loading lvm.conf (5) and any other configuration files.</p>

<p>formats Display recognised metadata formats.</p>

<p>help Display the help text.</p>

<p>pvdata Not implemented in LVM2.</p>

<p>segtypes Display recognised logical volume segment
types.</p>

<p>The following commands are not implemented in LVM2 but
might be in the future: lvmsadc, lvmsar, pvdata.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available for many of
the commands. They are implemented generically and
documented here rather than repeated on individual manual
pages.</p>

<p>-h | --help Display the help text.</p>

<p>--version Display version information.</p>

<p>-v | --verbose Set verbose level. Repeat from 1 to 3
times to increase the detail of messages sent to stdout and
stderr. Overrides config file setting.</p>

<p>-d | --debug Set debug level. Repeat from 1 to 6 times
to increase the detail of messages sent to the log file
and/or syslog (if configured). Overrides config file
setting.</p>

<p>--quiet Suppress output and log messages. Overrides -d
and -v.</p>

<p>-t | --test Run in test mode. Commands will not update
metadata. This is implemented by dis- abling all metadata
writing but nevertheless returning success to the calling
function. This may lead to unusual error mes- sages in
multi-stage operations if a tool relies on reading back
metadata it believes has changed but hasnt.</p>

<p>--driverloaded { y | n } Whether or not the
device-mapper kernel driver is loaded. If you set this to n,
no attempt will be made to contact the driver.</p>

<p>-A | --autobackup { y | n } Whether or not to metadata
should be backed up automatically after a change. You are
strongly advised not to disable this! See vgcfgbackup
(8).</p>

<p>-P | --partial When set, the tools will do their best to
provide access to vol- ume groups that are only partially
available (one or more physi- cal volumes belonging to the
volume group are missing from the system). Where part of a
logical volume is missing, /dev/ioer- ror will be
substituted, and you could use dmsetup (8) to set this up to
return I/O errors when accessed, or create it as a large
block device of nulls. Metadata may not be changed with this
option. To insert a replacement physical volume of the same
or large size use pvcreate -u to set the uuid to match the
orig- inal followed by vgcfgrestore (8).</p>

<p>-M | --metadatatype type Specifies which type of on-disk
metadata to use, such as lvm1 or lvm2, which can be
abbreviated to 1 or 2 respectively. The default (lvm2) can
be changed by setting format in the global section of the
config file.</p>

<p>--ignorelockingfailure This lets you proceed with
read-only metadata operations such as lvchange -ay and
vgchange -ay even if the locking module fails. One use for
this is in a system init script if the lock direc- tory is
mounted read-only when the script runs.</p>

<p>--addtag tag Add the tag tag to a PV, VG or LV. A tag is
a word that can be used to group LVM2 objects of the same
type together. Tags can be given on the command line in
place of PV, VG or LV arguments. Tags should be prefixed
with @ to avoid ambiguity. Each tag is expanded by replacing
it with all objects possessing that tag which are of the
type expected by its position on the command line. PVs can
only possess tags while they are part of a Volume Group: PV
tags are discarded if the PV is removed from the VG. As an
example, you could tag some LVs as database and others as
userdata and then activate the database ones with lvchange
-ay @database. Objects can possess multiple tags
simultaneously. Only the new LVM2 metadata format supports
tagging: objects using the LVM1 metadata format cannot be
tagged because the on- disk format does not support it.
Snapshots cannot be tagged. Characters allowed in tags are:
A-Z a-z 0-9 _ + . -</p>

<p>--deltag tag Delete the tag tag from a PV, VG or LV, if
its present.</p>

<p>--alloc AllocationPolicy The allocation policy to use:
contiguous, cling, normal, any- where or inherit. When a
command needs to allocate physical extents from the volume
group, the allocation policy controls how they are chosen.
Each volume group and logical volume has an allocation
policy. The default for a volume group is normal which
applies common-sense rules such as not placing parallel
stripes on the same physical volume. The default for a
logical volume is inherit which applies the same policy as
for the vol- ume group. These policies can be changed using
lvchange (8) and vgchange (8) or over-ridden on the command
line of any command that performs allocation. The contiguous
policy requires that new extents be placed adjacent to
existing extents. The cling policy places new extents on the
same physical volume as exist- ing extents in the same
stripe of the Logical Volume. If there are sufficient free
extents to satisfy an allocation request but normal doesnt
use them, anywhere will - even if that reduces performance
by placing two stripes on the same physical volume.</p>

<p>N.B. The policies described above are not implemented
fully yet. In particular, contiguous free space cannot be
broken up to sat- isfy allocation attempts.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LVM_SYSTEM_DIR Directory
containing lvm.conf and other LVM system files. Defaults to
&quot;/etc/lvm&quot;.</p>

<p>HOME Directory containing .lvm_history if the internal
readline shell is invoked.</p>

<p>LVM_VG_NAME The volume group name that is assumed for
any reference to a logical volume that doesnt specify a
path. Not set by default.</p>

<p>VALID NAMES The following characters are valid for VG
and LV names: a-z A-Z 0-9 + _ . -</p>

<p>VG and LV names cannot begin with a hyphen. There are
also various reserved names that are used internally by lvm
that can not be used as LV or VG names. A VG cannot be
called anything that exists in /dev/ at the time of
creation, nor can it be called . or ... A LV cannot be
called . .. snapshot or pvmove. The LV name may also not
con- tain the strings _mlog or _mimage</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All tools return a status code of zero on
success or non-zero on fail- ure.</p>
