<p>NAME tabs - set tabs on a terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tabs [-v[n]] [-ahuUV] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tabs program clears and sets tab-stops
on the terminal. This uses the terminfo clear_all_tabs and
set_tab capabilities. If either is absent, tabs is unable to
clear/set tab-stops. The terminal should be configured to
use hard tabs, e.g.,</p>

<p>stty tab0</p>

<p>OPTIONS General Options -Tname Tell tabs which terminal
type to use. If this option is not given, tabs will use the
$TERM environment variable. If that is not set, it will use
the ansi+tabs entry.</p>

<p>-d The debugging option shows a ruler line, followed by
two data lines. The first data line shows the expected
tab-stops marked with asterisks. The second data line shows
the actual tab-stops, marked with asterisks.</p>

<p>-n This option tells tabs to check the options and run
any debugging option, but not to modify the terminal
settings.</p>

<p>The tabs program processes a single list of tab stops.
The last option to be processed which defines a list is the
one that determines the list to be processed.</p>

<p>Implicit Lists Use a single number as an option, e.g.,
&quot;-5&quot; to set tabs at the given interval (in this
case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.). Tabs are repeated up to the
right margin of the screen.</p>

<p>Explicit Lists An explicit list can be defined after the
options (this does not use a &quot;-&quot;). The values in
the list must be in increasing numeric order, and greater
than zero. They are separated by a comma or a blank, for
exam- ple,</p>

<p>tabs 1,6,11,16,21 tabs 1 6 11 16 21 Use a + to treat a
number as an increment relative to the previous value,
e.g.,</p>

<p>tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5 which is equivalent to the
1,6,11,16,21 example.</p>

<p>Predefined Tab-Stops X/Open defines several predefined
lists of tab stops.</p>

<p>-a Assembler, IBM S/370, first format</p>

<p>-a2 Assembler, IBM S/370, second format</p>

<p>-c COBOL, normal format</p>

<p>-c2 COBOL compact format</p>

<p>-c3 COBOL compact format extended</p>

<p>-f FORTRAN</p>

<p>-p PL/I</p>

<p>-s SNOBOL</p>

<p>-u UNIVAC 1100 Assembler</p>

<p>PORTABILITY X/Open describes a +m option, to set a
terminal s left-margin. None of the entries in the terminal
database provide this capability.</p>

<p>The -d (debug) and -n (no-op) options are extensions not
provided by other implementations.</p>

<p>Documentation for other implementations states that
there is a limit on the number of tab stops. While some
terminals may not accept an arbi- trary number of tab stops,
this implementation will attempt to set tab stops up to the
right margin of the screen, if the given list happens to be
that long.</p>
