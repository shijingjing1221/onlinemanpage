<p>NAME lvreduce - reduce the size of a logical volume</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvreduce [-A|--autobackup y|n] [-d|--debug]
[-f|--force] [-h|-?|--help] [--noudevsync] {-l|--extents
[-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|FREE|ORI- GIN}] | -L|--size
[-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]} [-n|--nofsck]
[-r|--resizefs] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose]
LogicalVolume[Path]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a
logical volume. Be careful when reducing a logical volumes
size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!! You should
therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is
resized before running lvreduce so that the extents that are
to be removed are not in use. Shrinking snapshot logical
volumes (see lvcreate(8) for information to create
snapshots) is supported as well. But to change the number of
copies in a mirrored logical volume use lvconvert (8). Sizes
will be rounded if necessary - for example, the volume size
must be an exact number of extents and the size of a striped
segment must be a multiple of the number of stripes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force size reduction without prompting even
when it may cause data loss.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
[-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|FREE|ORIGIN}] Reduce or set
the logical volume size in units of logical extents. With
the - sign the value will be subtracted from the logical
volumes actual size and without it the value will be taken
as an absolute size. The number can also be expressed as a
percentage of the total space in the Volume Group with the
suffix %VG, relative to the existing size of the Logical
Volume with the suffix %LV, as a percentage of the remaining
free space in the Volume Group with the suffix %FREE, or
(for a snapshot) as a percentage of the total space in the
Origin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.</p>

<p>-L, --size [-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Reduce
or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes. A size
suffix of k for kilobyte, m for megabyte, g for gigabytes, t
for terabytes, p for petabytes or e for exabytes is
optional. With the - sign the value will be subtracted from
the logical volumes actual size and without it it will be
taken as an abso- lute size.</p>

<p>-n, --nofsck Do not perform fsck before resizing
filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need to use
--force to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>-r, --resizefs Resize underlying filesystem together
with the logical volume using fsadm(8).</p>

<p>Example &quot;lvreduce -l -3 vg00/lvol1&quot; reduces
the size of logical volume lvol1 in volume group vg00 by 3
logical extents.</p>
