<p>NAME getopt - parse command options (enhanced)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getopt optstring parameters getopt [options]
[--] optstring parameters getopt [options] -o|--options
optstring [options] [--] parameters</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getopt is used to break up (parse) options
in command lines for easy parsing by shell procedures, and
to check for legal options. It uses the GNU getopt(3)
routines to do this.</p>

<p>The parameters getopt is called with can be divided into
two parts: options which modify the way getopt will parse
(options and -o|--options optstring in the SYNOPSIS), and
the parameters which are to be parsed (parameters in the
SYNOPSIS). The second part will start at the first
non-option parameter that is not an option argument, or
after the first occurrence of --. If no -o or --options
option is found in the first part, the first parameter of
the second part is used as the short options string.</p>

<p>If the environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, or
if its first parameter is not an option (does not start with
a -, this is the first format in the SYNOPSIS), getopt will
generate output that is com- patible with that of other
versions of getopt(1). It will still do parameter shuffling
and recognize optional arguments (see section COM-
PATIBILITY for more information).</p>

<p>Traditional implementations of getopt(1) are unable to
cope with whitespace and other (shell-specific) special
characters in arguments and non-option parameters. To solve
this problem, this implementation can generate quoted output
which must once again be interpreted by the shell (usually
by using the eval command). This has the effect of pre-
serving those characters, but you must call getopt in a way
that is no longer compatible with other versions (the second
or third format in the SYNOPSIS). To determine whether this
enhanced version of getopt(1) is installed, a special test
option (-T) can be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --alternative Allow long options to start
with a single -.</p>

<p>-h, --help Output a small usage guide and exit
successfully. No other out- put is generated.</p>

<p>-l, --longoptions longopts The long (multi-character)
options to be recognized. More than one option name may be
specified at once, by separating the names with commas. This
option may be given more than once, the longopts are
cumulative. Each long option name in longopts may be
followed by one colon to indicate it has a required
argument, and by two colons to indicate it has an optional
argument.</p>

<p>-n, --name progname The name that will be used by the
getopt(3) routines when it reports errors. Note that errors
of getopt(1) are still reported as coming from getopt.</p>

<p>-o, --options shortopts The short (one-character)
options to be recognized. If this option is not found, the
first parameter of getopt that does not start with a - (and
is not an option argument) is used as the short options
string. Each short option character in shortopts may be
followed by one colon to indicate it has a required argu-
ment, and by two colons to indicate it has an optional
argument. The first character of shortopts may be + or - to
influence the way options are parsed and output is generated
(see section SCANNING MODES for details).</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Disable error reporting by getopt(3).</p>

<p>-Q, --quiet-output Do not generate normal output. Errors
are still reported by getopt(3), unless you also use -q.</p>

<p>-s, --shell shell Set quoting conventions to those of
shell. If no -s argument is found, the BASH conventions are
used. Valid arguments are cur- rently sh bash, csh, and
tcsh.</p>

<p>-u, --unquoted Do not quote the output. Note that
whitespace and special (shell-dependent) characters can
cause havoc in this mode (like they do with other getopt(1)
implementations).</p>

<p>-T, --test Test if your getopt(1) is this enhanced
version or an old ver- sion. This generates no output, and
sets the error status to 4. Other implementations of
getopt(1), and this version if the environment variable
GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, will return -- and error status
0.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output version information and exit
successfully. No other out- put is generated.</p>

<p>PARSING This section specifies the format of the second
part of the parameters of getopt (the parameters in the
SYNOPSIS). The next section (OUTPUT) describes the output
that is generated. These parameters were typically the
parameters a shell function was called with. Care must be
taken that each parameter the shell function was called with
corresponds to exactly one parameter in the parameter list
of getopt (see the EXAM- PLES). All parsing is done by the
GNU getopt(3) routines.</p>

<p>The parameters are parsed from left to right. Each
parameter is classi- fied as a short option, a long option,
an argument to an option, or a non-option parameter.</p>

<p>A simple short option is a - followed by a short option
character. If the option has a required argument, it may be
written directly after the option character or as the next
parameter (ie. separated by whites- pace on the command
line). If the option has an optional argument, it must be
written directly after the option character if present.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify several short options after
one -, as long as all (except possibly the last) do not have
required or optional arguments.</p>

<p>A long option normally begins with -- followed by the
long option name. If the option has a required argument, it
may be written directly after the long option name,
separated by =, or as the next argument (ie. separated by
whitespace on the command line). If the option has an
optional argument, it must be written directly after the
long option name, separated by =, if present (if you add the
= but nothing behind it, it is interpreted as if no argument
was present; this is a slight bug, see the BUGS). Long
options may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation is
not ambiguous.</p>

<p>Each parameter not starting with a -, and not a required
argument of a previous option, is a non-option parameter.
Each parameter after a -- parameter is always interpreted as
a non-option parameter. If the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, or if the short option string
started with a +, all remaining parameters are interpreted
as non-option parameters as soon as the first non-option
parameter is found.</p>

<p>OUTPUT Output is generated for each element described in
the previous section. Output is done in the same order as
the elements are specified in the input, except for
non-option parameters. Output can be done in compati- ble
(unquoted) mode, or in such way that whitespace and other
special characters within arguments and non-option
parameters are preserved (see QUOTING). When the output is
processed in the shell script, it will seem to be composed
of distinct elements that can be processed one by one (by
using the shift command in most shell languages). This is
imperfect in unquoted mode, as elements can be split at
unexpected places if they contain whitespace or special
characters.</p>

<p>If there are problems parsing the parameters, for
example because a required argument is not found or an
option is not recognized, an error will be reported on
stderr, there will be no output for the offending element,
and a non-zero error status is returned.</p>

<p>For a short option, a single - and the option character
are generated as one parameter. If the option has an
argument, the next parameter will be the argument. If the
option takes an optional argument, but none was found, the
next parameter will be generated but be empty in quoting
mode, but no second parameter will be generated in unquoted
(compatible) mode. Note that many other getopt(1)
implementations do not support optional arguments.</p>

<p>If several short options were specified after a single -
, each will be present in the output as a separate
parameter.</p>

<p>For a long option, -- and the full option name are
generated as one parameter. This is done regardless whether
the option was abbreviated or specified with a single - in
the input. Arguments are handled as with short options.</p>

<p>Normally, no non-option parameters output is generated
until all options and their arguments have been generated.
Then -- is generated as a single parameter, and after it the
non-option parameters in the order they were found, each as
a separate parameter. Only if the first character of the
short options string was a - , non-option parameter output
is generated at the place they are found in the input (this
is not supported if the first format of the SYNOPSIS is
used; in that case all preceding occurrences of - and + are
ignored).</p>

<p>QUOTING In compatible mode, whitespace or special
characters in arguments or non-option parameters are not
handled correctly. As the output is fed to the shell script,
the script does not know how it is supposed to break the
output into separate parameters. To circumvent this problem,
this implementation offers quoting. The idea is that output
is gener- ated with quotes around each parameter. When this
output is once again fed to the shell (usually by a shell
eval command), it is split cor- rectly into separate
parameters.</p>

<p>Quoting is not enabled if the environment variable
GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, if the first form of the SYNOPSIS
is used, or if the option -u is found.</p>

<p>Different shells use different quoting conventions. You
can use the -s option to select the shell you are using. The
following shells are currently supported: sh, bash, csh and
tcsh. Actually, only two flavors are distinguished: sh-like
quoting conventions and csh-like quoting conventions.
Chances are that if you use another shell script language,
one of these flavors can still be used.</p>

<p>SCANNING MODES The first character of the short options
string may be a - or a + to indicate a special scanning
mode. If the first calling form in the SYNOPSIS is used they
are ignored; the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
still examined, though.</p>

<p>If the first character is + , or if the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, parsing stops as soon as
the first non-option parameter (ie. a parameter that does
not start with a -) is found that is not an option argument.
The remaining parameters are all inter- preted as non-option
parameters.</p>

<p>If the first character is a -, non-option parameters are
outputted at the place where they are found; in normal
operation, they are all col- lected at the end of output
after a -- parameter has been generated. Note that this --
parameter is still generated, but it will always be the last
parameter in this mode.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY This version of getopt(1) is written to be
as compatible as possible to other versions. Usually you can
just replace them with this version without any
modifications, and with some advantages.</p>

<p>If the first character of the first parameter of getopt
is not a -, getopt goes into compatibility mode. It will
interpret its first param- eter as the string of short
options, and all other arguments will be parsed. It will
still do parameter shuffling (ie. all non-option param-
eters are outputted at the end), unless the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.</p>

<p>The environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE forces getopt
into compati- bility mode. Setting both this environment
variable and POSIXLY_CORRECT offers 100% compatibility for
difficult programs. Usually, though, neither is needed.</p>

<p>In compatibility mode, leading - and + characters in the
short options string are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES getopt returns error code 0 for successful
parsing, 1 if getopt(3) returns errors, 2 if it does not
understand its own parameters, 3 if an internal error occurs
like out-of-memory, and 4 if it is called with -T.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example scripts for (ba)sh and (t)csh are
provided with the getopt(1) distribution, and are optionally
installed in /usr/share/getopt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT POSIXLY_CORRECT This environment variable is
examined by the getopt(3) routines. If it is set, parsing
stops as soon as a parameter is found that is not an option
or an option argument. All remaining parameters are also
interpreted as non-option parameters, regardless whether
they start with a -.</p>

<p>GETOPT_COMPATIBLE Forces getopt to use the first calling
format as specified in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p>BUGS getopt(3) can parse long options with optional
arguments that are given an empty optional argument (but can
not do this for short options). This getopt(1) treats
optional arguments that are empty as if they were not
present.</p>

<p>The syntax if you do not want any short option variables
at all is not very intuitive (you have to set them
explicitly to the empty string).</p>
