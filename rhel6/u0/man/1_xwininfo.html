<p>NAME xwininfo - window information utility for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xwininfo [-help] [-id id] [-root] [-name name]
[-int] [-children] [-tree] [-stats] [-bits] [-events]
[-size] [-wm] [-shape] [-frame] [-all] [-english] [-metric]
[-display display]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xwininfo is a utility for displaying
information about windows. Vari- ous information is
displayed depending on which options are selected. If no
options are chosen, -stats is assumed.</p>

<p>The user has the option of selecting the target window
with the mouse (by clicking any mouse button in the desired
window) or by specifying its window id on the command line
with the -id option. Or instead of specifying the window by
its id number, the -name option may be used to specify which
window is desired by name. There is also a special -root
option to quickly obtain information on the screens root
window.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -help Print out the Usage: command syntax
summary.</p>

<p>-id id This option allows the user to specify a target
window id on the command line rather than using the mouse to
select the tar- get window. This is very useful in debugging
X applications where the target window is not mapped to the
screen or where the use of the mouse might be impossible or
interfere with the application.</p>

<p>-name name This option allows the user to specify that
the window named name is the target window on the command
line rather than using the mouse to select the target
window.</p>

<p>-root This option specifies that Xs root window is the
target win- dow. This is useful in situations where the root
window is completely obscured.</p>

<p>-int This option specifies that all X window ids should
be displayed as integer values. The default is to display
them as hexadeci- mal values.</p>

<p>-children This option causes the root, parent, and
children windows ids and names of the selected window to be
displayed.</p>

<p>-tree This option is like -children but displays all
children recur- sively.</p>

<p>-stats This option causes the display of various
attributes pertaining to the location and appearance of the
selected window. Infor- mation displayed includes the
location of the window, its width and height, its depth,
border width, visual id and class, col- ormap id if any, map
state, backing-store hint, and location of the corners.</p>

<p>-bits This option causes the display of various
attributes pertaining to the selected windows raw bits and
how the selected window is to be stored. Displayed
information includes the selected windows bit gravity,
window gravity, backing-store hint, back- ing-planes value,
backing pixel, and whether or not the window has save-under
set.</p>

<p>-events This option causes the selected window s event
masks to be dis- played. Both the event mask of events
wanted by some client and the event mask of events not to
propagate are displayed.</p>

<p>-size This option causes the selected windows sizing
hints to be displayed. Displayed information includes: for
both the normal size hints and the zoom size hints, the user
supplied location if any; the program supplied location if
any; the user supplied size if any; the program supplied
size if any; the minimum size if any; the maximum size if
any; the resize increments if any; and the minimum and
maximum aspect ratios if any.</p>

<p>-wm This option causes the selected window s window
manager hints to be displayed. Information displayed may
include whether or not the application accepts input, what
the windows icon win- dow # and name is, where the windows
icon should go, and what the windows initial state should
be.</p>

<p>-shape This option causes the selected window s window
and border shape extents to be displayed.</p>

<p>-frame This option causes window manager frames to be
considered when manually selecting windows.</p>

<p>-metric This option causes all individual height, width,
and x and y positions to be displayed in millimeters as well
as number of pixels, based on what the server thinks the
resolution is. Geometry specifications that are in +x+y form
are not changed.</p>

<p>-english This option causes all individual height,
width, and x and y positions to be displayed in inches (and
feet, yards, and miles if necessary) as well as number of
pixels. -metric and -english may both be enabled at the same
time.</p>

<p>-all This option is a quick way to ask for all
information possible.</p>

<p>-display display This option allows you to specify the
server to connect to; see X(7).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is a sample summary taken with no
options specified:</p>

<p>xwininfo: Window id: 0x60000f &quot;xterm&quot;</p>

<p>Absolute upper-left X: 2 Absolute upper-left Y: 85
Relative upper-left X: 0 Relative upper-left Y: 25 Width:
579 Height: 316 Depth: 8 Visual: 0x1e Visual Class:

Gravity State: NorthWestGravity Backing Store State:

Override Redirect State: no Corners: +2+85 -699+85 -699-623
+2-623 -geometry 80x24+0+58</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY To get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xprop(1), xdpyinfo(1), xdriinfo(1),
xvinfo(1), glxinfo(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Using -stats -bits shows some redundant
information.</p>

<p>The -geometry string displayed must make assumptions
about the windows border width and the behavior of the
application and the window man- ager. As a result, the
location given is not always correct.</p>
