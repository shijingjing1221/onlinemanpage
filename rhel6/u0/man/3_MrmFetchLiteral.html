<p>NAME MrmFetchLiteral Fetches a literal from a UID
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Mrm/MrmPublic.h&gt; Cardinal
MrmFetchLiteral( MrmHierarchy hierarchy_id, String index,
Display *display, XtPointer *value, MrmCode *type);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmFetchLiteral function reads and
returns the value and type of a literal (named value) that
is stored as a public resource in a single UID file. This
function returns a pointer to the value of the literal. For
example, an integer is always returned as a pointer to an
integer, and a string is always returned as a pointer to a
string.</p>

<p>Applications should not use MrmFetchLiteral for fetching
icon or color literals. If this is attempted,
MrmFetchLiteral returns an error.</p>

<p>hierarchy_id Specifies the ID of the UID hierarchy that
contains the spec- ified literal. The value of hierarchy_id
was returned in a previous call to
MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay.</p>

<p>index Specifies the UIL name of the literal (pixmap) to
fetch. You must define this name in UIL as an exported
value.</p>

<p>display Specifies the display used for the pixmap. The
display argu- ment specifies the connection to the X server.
For more information on the Display structure, see the Xlib
function XOpenDisplay.</p>

<p>value Returns the ID of the named literal s value. The
function allocates space for the returned value. The
application is responsible for managing the allocated space
by calling the appropriate deallocation function. For
example, if the returned ID symbolizes a pixmap, then the
application can recover the allocated space by calling
XmDestroyPixmap.</p>

<p>type Returns the named literals data type. Types are
defined in the include file Mrm/MrmPublic.h.</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns one of the following status
return constants:</p>

<p>MrmSUCCESS The function executed successfully.</p>

<p>MrmBAD_HIERARCHY The hierarchy ID was invalid.</p>

<p>MrmNOT_FOUND The literal was not found in the UIL
file.</p>

<p>MrmWRONG_TYPE The caller tried to fetch a literal of a
type not supported by this function.</p>

<p>MrmFAILURE The function failed.</p>

MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay(3), MrmFetchIcon- Literal(3),
MrmFetchColorLiteral(3), and XOpenDisplay(3).</p>
