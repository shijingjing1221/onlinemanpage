<p>NAME ntp-keygen - generate public and private keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ntp-keygen [ -deGgHIMPT ] [ -c [RSA-MD2 |
RSA-MD5 | RSA-SHA | RSA-SHA1 | RSA-MDC2 | RSA-RIPEMD160 |
DSA-SHA | DSA-SHA1 ] ] [ -i name ] [ -m modulus ] [ -p
password ] [ -q password ] [ -S [ RSA | DSA ] ] [ -s name ]
[ -v nkeys ] [ -V params ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program generates cryptographic data
files used by the NTPv4 authentication and identification
schemes. It generates MD5 key files used in symmetric key
cryptography. In addition, if the OpenSSL soft- ware library
has been installed, it generates keys, certificate and
identity files used in public key cryptography. These files
are used for cookie encryption, digital signature and
challenge/response identi- fication algorithms compatible
with the Internet standard security infrastructure.</p>

<p>By default, files are not encrypted by ntp-keygen. The
-p password option specifies the write password and -q
password option the read password for previously encrypted
files. The ntp-keygen program prompts for the password if it
reads an encrypted file and the password is missing or
incorrect. If an encrypted file is read successfully and no
write password is specified, the read password is used as
the write password by default.</p>

<p>The ntpd configuration command crypto pw password
specifies the read password for previously encrypted files.
The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing or
incorrect. For convenience, if a file has been previously
encrypted, the default read password is the name of the host
running the program. If the previous write password is
specified as the host name, these files can be read by that
host with no explicit password.</p>

<p>All files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format, so
they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to other
sites and certificate authorities. File names begin with the
prefix ntpkey_ and end with the postfix _hostname.filestamp,
where hostname is usually the string returned by the Unix
gethostname() routine, and filestamp is the NTP seconds when
the file was generated, in decimal digits. This both guar-
antees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance procedures,
since all files can be quickly removed by a rm ntpkey*
command or all files gen- erated at a specific time can be
removed by a rm *filestamp command. To further reduce the
risk of misconfiguration, the first two lines of a file
contain the file name and generation date and time as
comments.</p>

<p>All files are installed by default in the keys directory
/etc/ntp/crypto. The actual location of the keys directory
and each file can be overridden by configuration commands,
but this is not rec- ommended. Normally, the files for each
host are generated by that host and used only by that host,
although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.</p>

<p>Normally, files containing private values, including the
host key, sign key and identification parameters, are
permitted root read/write-only; while others containing
public values are permitted world readable. Alternatively,
files containing private values can be encrypted and these
files permitted world readable, which simplifies maintenance
in shared file systems. Since uniqueness is insured by the
hostname and file name extensions, the files for a NFS
server and dependent clients can all be installed in the
same shared directory.</p>

<p>The recommended practice is to keep the file name
extensions when installing a file and to install a soft link
from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page to
the generated files. This allows new file generations to be
activated simply by changing the link. If a link is present,
ntpd follows it to the file name to extract the filestamp.
If a link is not present, ntpd extracts the filestamp from
the file itself. This allows clients to verify that the file
and gener- ation times are always current. The ntp-keygen
program uses the same extension for all files generated at
one time, so each generation is distinct and can be readily
recognized in monitoring data.</p>

<p>RUNNING THE PROGRAM The safest way to run the ntp-keygen
program is logged in directly as root. The recommended
procedure is change to the keys directory, usu- ally
/etc/ntp/crypto, then run the program. When run for the
first time, or if all ntpkey files have been removed, the
program generates a RSA host key file and matching RSA-MD5
certificate file, which is all that is necessary in many
cases. The program also generates soft links from the
generic names to the respective files. If run again, the
pro- gram uses the same host key file, but generates a new
certificate file and link.</p>

<p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required
and so must be RSA type. By default, the host key is also
the sign key used to encrypt signatures. When necessary, a
different sign key can be specified and this can be either
RSA or DSA type. By default, the message digest type is MD5,
but any combination of sign key type and message digest type
supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified, including
those using the MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, MDC2 and RIPE160
message digest algo- rithms. However, the scheme specified
in the certificate must be com- patible with the sign key.
Certificates using any digest algorithm are compatible with
RSA sign keys; however, only SHA and SHA1 certificates are
compatible with DSA sign keys.</p>

<p>Private/public key files and certificates are compatible
with other OpenSSL applications and very likely other
libraries as well. Certifi- cates or certificate requests
derived from them should be compatible with extant industry
practice, although some users might find the interpretation
of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the
identification parameter files, although encoded as the
other files, are probably not compatible with anything other
than Autokey.</p>

<p>Running the program as other than root and using the
Unix su command to assume root may not work properly, since
by default the OpenSSL library looks for the random seed
file .rnd in the user home directory. How- ever, there
should be only one .rnd, most conveniently in the root
directory, so it is convenient to define the $RANDFILE
environment variable used by the OpenSSL library as the path
to /.rnd.</p>

<p>Installing the keys as root might not work in
NFS-mounted shared file systems, as NFS clients may not be
able to write to the shared keys directory, even as root. In
this case, NFS clients can specify the files in another
directory such as /etc using the keysdir command. There is
no need for one client to read the keys and certificates of
other clients or servers, as these data are obtained
automatically by the Autokey protocol.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, cryptographic files are generated by the
host that uses them, but it is possible for a trusted agent
(TA) to generate these files for other hosts; however, in
such cases files should always be encrypted. The subject
name and trusted name default to the hostname of the host
generating the files, but can be changed by command line
options. It is convenient to designate the owner name and
trusted name as the subject and issuer fields, respectively,
of the certificate. The owner name is also used for the host
and sign key files, while the trusted name is used for the
identity files.</p>

<p>TRUSTED HOSTS AND GROUPS Each cryptographic
configuration involves selection of a signature scheme and
identification scheme, called a cryptotype, as explained in
the Authentication Options page. The default cryptotype uses
RSA encryption, MD5 message digest and TC identification.
First, configure a NTP subnet including one or more
low-stratum trusted hosts from which all other hosts derive
synchronization directly or indirectly. Trusted hosts have
trusted certificates; all other hosts have nontrusted cer-
tificates. These hosts will automatically and dynamically
build author- itative certificate trails to one or more
trusted hosts. A trusted group is the set of all hosts that
have, directly or indirectly, a cer- tificate trail ending
at a trusted host. The trail is defined by static
configuration file entries or dynamic means described on the
Automatic NTP Configuration Options page.</p>

<p>On each trusted host as root, change to the keys
directory. To insure a fresh fileset, remove all ntpkey
files. Then run ntp-keygen -T to gen- erate keys and a
trusted certificate. On all other hosts do the same, but
leave off the -T flag to generate keys and nontrusted
certificates. When complete, start the NTP daemons beginning
at the lowest stratum and working up the tree. It may take
some time for Autokey to instanti- ate the certificate
trails throughout the subnet, but setting up the environment
is completely automatic.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to use a different sign key or
different digest/sig- nature scheme than the default, run
ntp-keygen with the -S type option, where type is either RSA
or DSA. The most often need to do this is when a DSA-signed
certificate is used. If it is necessary to use a different
certificate scheme than the default, run ntp-keygen with the
-c scheme option and selected scheme as needed. If
ntp-keygen is run again with- out these options, it
generates a new certificate using the same scheme and sign
key.</p>

<p>After setting up the environment it is advisable to
update certificates from time to time, if only to extend the
validity interval. Simply run ntp-keygen with the same flags
as before to generate new certificates using existing keys.
However, if the host or sign key is changed, ntpd should be
restarted. When ntpd is restarted, it loads any new files
and restarts the protocol. Other dependent hosts will
continue as usual until signatures are refreshed, at which
time the protocol is restarted.</p>

<p>IDENTITY SCHEMES As mentioned on the Autonomous
Authentication page, the default TC identity scheme is
vulnerable to a middleman attack. However, there are more
secure identity schemes available, including PC, IFF, GQ and
MV described on the Identification Schemes page. These
schemes are based on a TA, one or more trusted hosts and
some number of nontrusted hosts. Trusted hosts prove
identity using values provided by the TA, while the
remaining hosts prove identity using values provided by a
trusted host and certificate trails that end on that host.
The name of a trusted host is also the name of its sugroup
and also the subject and issuer name on its trusted
certificate. The TA is not necessarily a trusted host in
this sense, but often is.</p>

<p>In some schemes there are separate keys for servers and
clients. A server can also be a client of another server,
but a client can never be a server for another client. In
general, trusted hosts and non- trusted hosts that operate
as both server and client have parameter files that contain
both server and client keys. Hosts that operate only as
clients have key files that contain only client keys.</p>

<p>The PC scheme supports only one trusted host in the
group. On trusted host alice run ntp-keygen -P -p password
to generate the host key file ntpkey_RSAkey_alice.filestamp
and trusted private certificate file ntp-
key_RSA-MD5_cert_alice.filestamp. Copy both files to all
group hosts; they replace the files which would be generated
in other schemes. On each host bob install a soft link from
the generic name ntpkey_host_bob to the host key file and
soft link ntpkey_cert_bob to the private cer- tificate file.
Note the generic links are on bob, but point to files
generated by trusted host alice. In this scheme it is not
possible to refresh either the keys or certificates without
copying them to all other hosts in the group.</p>

<p>For the IFF scheme proceed as in the TC scheme to
generate keys and certificates for all group hosts, then for
every trusted host in the group, generate the IFF parameter
file. On trusted host alice run ntp- keygen -T -I -p
password to produce her parameter file ntpkey_IFF-
par_alice.filestamp, which includes both server and client
keys. Copy this file to all group hosts that operate as both
servers and clients and install a soft link from the generic
ntpkey_iff_alice to this file. If there are no hosts
restricted to operate only as clients, there is nothing
further to do. As the IFF scheme is independent of keys and
certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.</p>

<p>If a rogue client has the parameter file, it could
masquerade as a legitimate server and present a middleman
threat. To eliminate this threat, the client keys can be
extracted from the parameter file and distributed to all
restricted clients. After generating the parameter file, on
alice run ntp-keygen -e and pipe the output to a file or
mail program. Copy or mail this file to all restricted
clients. On these clients install a soft link from the
generic ntpkey_iff_alice to this file. To further protect
the integrity of the keys, each file can be encrypted with a
secret password.</p>

<p>For the GQ scheme proceed as in the TC scheme to
generate keys and cer- tificates for all group hosts, then
for every trusted host in the group, generate the IFF
parameter file. On trusted host alice run ntp- keygen -T -G
-p password to produce her parameter file ntp-
key_GQpar_alice.filestamp, which includes both server and
client keys. Copy this file to all group hosts and install a
soft link from the generic ntpkey_gq_alice to this file. In
addition, on each host bob install a soft link from generic
ntpkey_gq_bob to this file. As the GQ scheme updates the GQ
parameters file and certificate at the same time, keys and
certificates can be regenerated as needed.</p>

<p>For the MV scheme, proceed as in the TC scheme to
generate keys and certificates for all group hosts. For
illustration assume trish is the TA, alice one of several
trusted hosts and bob one of her clients. On TA trish run
ntp-keygen -V n -p password, where n is the number of
revokable keys (typically 5) to produce the parameter file
ntp- keys_MVpar_trish.filestamp and client key files ntp-
keys_MVkeyd_trish.filestamp where d is the key number (0
&lt; d &lt; n). Copy the parameter file to alice and install
a soft link from the generic ntpkey_mv_alice to this file.
Copy one of the client key files to alice for later
distribution to her clients. It doesnt matter which client
key file goes to alice, since they all work the same way.
Alice copies the client key file to all of her cliens. On
client bob install a soft link from generic ntpkey_mvkey_bob
to the client key file. As the MV scheme is independent of
keys and certificates, these files can be refreshed as
needed.</p>

Mu-Varadharajan (MV) iden- tification scheme.</p>

<p>RANDOM SEED FILE All cryptographically sound key
generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy
seed used to initialize the internal pseudo-ran- dom number
generator used by the library routines. The OpenSSL library
uses a designated random seed file for this purpose. The
file must be available when starting the NTP daemon and
ntp-keygen program. If a site supports OpenSSL or its
companion OpenSSH, it is very likely that means to do this
are already available.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that entropy must be
evolved for each generation, for otherwise the random number
sequence would be predictable. Various means dependent on
external events, such as keystroke intervals, can be used to
do this and some systems have built-in entropy sources.
Suitable means are described in the OpenSSL software
documentation, but are outside the scope of this page.</p>

<p>The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is
contained in a file, usually called .rnd, which must be
available when starting the NTP dae- mon or the ntp-keygen
program. The NTP daemon will first look for the file using
the path specified by the randfile subcommand of the crypto
configuration command. If not specified in this way, or when
starting the ntp-keygen program, the OpenSSL library will
look for the file using the path specified by the RANDFILE
environment variable in the user home directory, whether
root or some other user. If the RANDFILE environment
variable is not present, the library will look for the .rnd
file in the user home directory. If the file is not
available or cannot be written, the daemon exits with a
message to the system log and the program exits with a
suitable error message.</p>

<p>On systems that provide /dev/urandom, the randomness
device is used instead and the file specified by the
randfile subcommand or the RAND- FILE environment variable
is ignored.</p>

<p>CRYPTOGRAPHIC DATA FILES All other file formats begin
with two lines. The first contains the file name, including
the generated host name and filestamp. The second contains
the datestamp in conventional Unix date format. Lines begin-
ning with # are considered comments and ignored by the
ntp-keygen pro- gram and ntpd daemon. Cryptographic values
are encoded first using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted if
necessary, and finally written PEM- encoded printable ASCII
format preceded and followed by MIME content identifier
lines.</p>

<p>The format of the symmetric keys file is somewhat
different than the other files in the interest of backward
compatibility. Since DES-CBC is deprecated in NTPv4, the
only key format of interest is MD5 alphanu- meric strings.
Following hte heard the keys are entered one per line in the
format</p>

<p>keyno type key</p>

<p>where keyno is a positive integer in the range 1-65,535,
type is the string MD5 defining the key format and key is
the key itself, which is a printable ASCII string 16
characters or less in length. Each charac- ter is chosen
from the 93 printable characters in the range 0x21 through
0x7f excluding space and the # character.</p>

<p>Note that the keys used by the ntpq and ntpdc programs
are checked against passwords requested by the programs and
entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify
these keys in human readable ASCII format.</p>

<p>The ntp-keygen program generates a MD5 symmetric keys
file ntp- key_MD5key_hostname.filestamp. Since the file
contains private shared keys, it should be visible only to
root and distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts.
The NTP daemon loads the file ntp.keys, so ntp- keygen
installs a soft link from this name to the generated file.
Sub- sequently, similar soft links must be installed by
manual or automated means on the other subnet hosts. While
this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol,
it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration
commands used by the ntpq and ntpdc utilities.</p>

<p>BUGS It can take quite a while to generate some
cryptographic values, from one to several minutes with
modern architectures such as UltraSPARC and up to tens of
minutes to an hour with older architectures such as SPARC
IPC.</p>
