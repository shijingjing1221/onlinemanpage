<p>GETRUSAGE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETRUSAGE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getrusage - get information about resource
utilization</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *r_usage);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getrusage() function shall provide
measures of the resources used by the current process or its
terminated and waited-for child pro- cesses. If the value of
the who argument is RUSAGE_SELF, information shall be
returned about resources used by the current process. If the
value of the who argument is RUSAGE_CHILDREN, information
shall be returned about resources used by the terminated and
waited-for children of the current process. If the child is
never waited for (for example, if the parent has
SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the resource
information for the child process is discarded and not
included in the resource information provided by
getrusage().</p>

<p>The r_usage argument is a pointer to an object of type
struct rusage in which the returned information is
stored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getrusage()
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getrusage() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the who argument is not valid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Using getrusage() The following example returns
information about the resources used by the current
process.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt; ... int who =
RUSAGE_SELF; struct rusage usage; int ret;</p>

<p>ret = getrusage(who, &amp;usage);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
