<p>SEND(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SEND(2)</p>

<p>NAME send, sendto, sendmsg - send a message on a
socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len,
int flags);</p>

<p>ssize_t sendto(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len,
int flags, const struct sockaddr *dest_addr, socklen_t
addrlen);</p>

<p>ssize_t sendmsg(int sockfd, const struct msghdr *msg,
int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system calls send(), sendto(), and
sendmsg() are used to transmit a message to another
socket.</p>

<p>The send() call may be used only when the socket is in a
connected state (so that the intended recipient is known).
The only difference between send() and write(2) is the
presence of flags. With zero flags argument, send() is
equivalent to write(2). Also, the following call</p>

<p>send(sockfd, buf, len, flags);</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>sendto(sockfd, buf, len, flags, NULL, 0);</p>

<p>The argument sockfd is the file descriptor of the
sending socket.</p>

<p>If sendto() is used on a connection-mode (SOCK_STREAM,
SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket, the arguments dest_addr and addrlen
are ignored (and the error EISCONN may be returned when they
are not NULL and 0), and the error ENOTCONN is returned when
the socket was not actually connected. Oth- erwise, the
address of the target is given by dest_addr with addrlen
specifying its size. For sendmsg(), the address of the
target is given by msg.msg_name, with msg.msg_namelen
specifying its size.</p>

<p>For send() and sendto(), the message is found in buf and
has length len. For sendmsg(), the message is pointed to by
the elements of the array msg.msg_iov. The sendmsg() call
also allows sending ancillary data (also known as control
information).</p>

<p>If the message is too long to pass atomically through
the underlying protocol, the error EMSGSIZE is returned, and
the message is not trans- mitted.</p>

<p>No indication of failure to deliver is implicit in a
send(). Locally detected errors are indicated by a return
value of -1.</p>

<p>When the message does not fit into the send buffer of
the socket, send() normally blocks, unless the socket has
been placed in non-block- ing I/O mode. In non-blocking mode
it would fail with the error EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK in this
case. The select(2) call may be used to deter- mine when it
is possible to send more data.</p>

<p>The flags argument is the bitwise OR of zero or more of
the following flags.</p>

<p>MSG_CONFIRM (Since Linux 2.3.15) Tell the link layer
that forward progress happened: you got a successful reply
from the other side. If the link layer doesnt get this it
will regularly reprobe the neighbor (e.g., via a unicast
ARP). Only valid on SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets and
currently only implemented for IPv4 and IPv6. See arp(7) for
details.</p>

<p>MSG_DONTROUTE Don t use a gateway to send out the
packet, only send to hosts on directly connected networks.
This is usually used only by diagnostic or routing programs.
This is only defined for proto- col families that route;
packet sockets dont.</p>

<p>MSG_DONTWAIT (since Linux 2.2) Enables non-blocking
operation; if the operation would block, EAGAIN or
EWOULDBLOCK is returned (this can also be enabled using the
O_NONBLOCK flag with the F_SETFL fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>MSG_EOR (since Linux 2.2) Terminates a record (when this
notion is supported, as for sock- ets of type
SOCK_SEQPACKET).</p>

<p>MSG_MORE (Since Linux 2.4.4) The caller has more data to
send. This flag is used with TCP sockets to obtain the same
effect as the TCP_CORK socket option (see tcp(7)), with the
difference that this flag can be set on a per-call
basis.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6, this flag is also supported for UDP
sockets, and informs the kernel to package all of the data
sent in calls with this flag set into a single datagram
which is only trans- mitted when a call is performed that
does not specify this flag. (See also the UDP_CORK socket
option described in udp(7).)</p>

<p>MSG_NOSIGNAL (since Linux 2.2) Requests not to send
SIGPIPE on errors on stream oriented sock- ets when the
other end breaks the connection. The EPIPE error is still
returned.</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support
this notion (e.g., of type SOCK_STREAM); the underlying
protocol must also support out-of-band data.</p>

<p>The definition of the msghdr structure follows. See
recv(2) and below for an exact description of its
fields.</p>

<p>struct msghdr { void *msg_name; /* optional address */
socklen_t msg_namelen; /* size of address */ struct iovec
*msg_iov; /* scatter/gather array */ size_t msg_iovlen; /* #
elements in msg_iov */ void *msg_control; /* ancillary data,
see below */ socklen_t msg_controllen; /* ancillary data
buffer len */ int msg_flags; /* flags on received message */
};</p>

<p>You may send control information using the msg_control
and msg_con- trollen members. The maximum control buffer
length the kernel can pro- cess is limited per socket by the
value in /proc/sys/net/core/opt- mem_max; see socket(7).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these calls return the number
of characters sent. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS These are some standard errors generated by the
socket layer. Addi- tional errors may be generated and
returned from the underlying protocol modules; see their
respective manual pages.</p>

<p>EACCES (For Unix domain sockets, which are identified by
pathname) Write permission is denied on the destination
socket file, or search permission is denied for one of the
directories the path prefix. (See path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The socket is marked non-blocking
and the requested operation would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows
either error to be returned for this case, and does not
require these constants to have the same value, so a
portable application should check for both pos-
sibilities.</p>

<p>EBADF An invalid descriptor was specified.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET Connection reset by peer.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ The socket is not connection-mode, and no
peer address is set.</p>

<p>EFAULT An invalid user space address was specified for
an argument.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal occurred before any data was transmitted;
see sig- nal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid argument passed.</p>

<p>EISCONN The connection-mode socket was connected already
but a recipient was specified. (Now either this error is
returned, or the recipient specification is ignored.)</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The socket type requires that message be sent
atomically, and the size of the message to be sent made this
impossible.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS The output queue for a network interface was
full. This gener- ally indicates that the interface has
stopped sending, but may be caused by transient congestion.
(Normally, this does not occur in Linux. Packets are just
silently dropped when a device queue overflows.)</p>

<p>ENOMEM No memory available.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is not connected, and no target has
been given.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The argument sockfd is not a socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP Some bit in the flags argument is
inappropriate for the socket type.</p>

<p>EPIPE The local end has been shut down on a connection
oriented socket. In this case the process will also receive
a SIGPIPE unless MSG_NOSIGNAL is set.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. These function
calls appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 only describes the MSG_OOB and MSG_EOR
flags. The MSG_CONFIRM flag is a Linux extension.</p>

<p>NOTES The prototypes given above follow the Single Unix
Specification, as glibc2 also does; the flags argument was
int in 4.x BSD, but unsigned int in libc4 and libc5; the len
argument was int in 4.x BSD and libc4, but size_t in libc5;
the addrlen argument was int in 4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5.
See also accept(2).</p>

<p>According to POSIX.1-2001, the msg_controllen field of
the msghdr structure should be typed as socklen_t, but glibc
currently (2.4) types it as size_t.</p>

<p>BUGS Linux may return EPIPE instead of ENOTCONN.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of sendto() is shown in
getaddrinfo(3).</p>
