<p>POSIX_FADVISE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_FADVISE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_fadvise - file advisory information (ADVANCED
REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_fadvise(int fd, off_t offset, size_t len, int
advice);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_fadvise() function shall advise
the implementation on the expected behavior of the
application with respect to the data in the file associated
with the open file descriptor, fd, starting at offset and
continuing for len bytes. The specified range need not
currently exist in the file. If len is zero, all data
following offset is speci- fied. The implementation may use
this information to optimize handling of the specified data.
The posix_fadvise() function shall have no effect on the
semantics of other operations on the specified data,
although it may affect the performance of other
operations.</p>

<p>The advice to be applied to the data is specified by the
advice parame- ter and may be one of the following
values:</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NORMAL</p>

<p>Specifies that the application has no advice to give on
its behavior with respect to the specified data. It is the
default characteristic if no advice is given for an open
file.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified data sequentially from lower offsets to higher
offsets.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_RANDOM</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified data in a random order.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified data in the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects that it will not
access the specified data in the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified data once and then not reuse it thereafter.</p>

<p>These values are defined in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, posix_fadvise()
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_fadvise() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of advice is invalid.</p>

<p>ESPIPE The fd argument is associated with a pipe or
FIFO.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The posix_fadvise() function is part
of the Advisory Information option and need not be provided
on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
