<p>curl_easy_recv(3) libcurl Manual curl_easy_recv(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_easy_recv - receives raw data on an
&quot;easy&quot; connection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/easy.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLcode curl_easy_recv( CURL *curl, void *buffer,
size_t buflen, size_t *n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function receives raw data from the
established connection. You may use it together with
curl_easy_send(3) to implement custom proto- cols using
libcurl. This functionality can be particularly useful if
you use proxies and/or SSL encryption: libcurl will take
care of proxy negotiation and connection set-up.</p>

<p>buffer is a pointer to your buffer that will get the
received data. buflen is the maximum amount of data you can
get in that buffer. The variable n points to will receive
the number of received bytes.</p>

<p>To establish the connection, set CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY
option before calling curl_easy_perform(3). Note that
curl_easy_recv(3) does not work on connections that were
created without this option.</p>

<p>You must ensure that the socket has data to read before
calling curl_easy_recv(3), otherwise the call will return
CURLE_AGAIN - the socket is used in non-blocking mode
internally. Use curl_easy_get- info(3) with
CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to obtain the socket; use your operat-
ing system facilities like select(2) to check if it has any
data you can read.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY Added in 7.18.2.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, returns CURLE_OK, stores the
received data into buffer, and the number of bytes it
actually read into *n.</p>

<p>On failure, returns the appropriate error code.</p>

<p>If there is no data to read, the function returns
CURLE_AGAIN. Use your operating system facilities to wait
until the data is ready, and retry.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See sendrecv.c in docs/examples directory for
usage example.</p>
