<p>SPU_CREATE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SPU_CREATE(2)</p>

<p>NAME spu_create - create a new spu context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/spu.h&gt;</p>

<p>int spu_create(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t
mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The spu_create system call is used on
PowerPC machines that implement the Cell Broadband Engine
Architecture in order to access Synergistic Processor Units
(SPUs). It creates a new logical context for an SPU in
pathname and returns a handle to associated with it.
pathname must point to a non-existing directory in the mount
point of the SPU file system (spufs). When spu_create is
successful, a directory gets cre- ated on pathname and it is
populated with files.</p>

<p>The returned file handle can only be passed to
spu_run(2) or closed, other operations are not defined on
it. When it is closed, all associ- ated directory entries in
spufs are removed. When the last file handle pointing either
inside of the context directory or to this file descriptor
is closed, the logical SPU context is destroyed.</p>

<p>The parameter flags can be zero or any bitwise or d
combination of the following constants:</p>

<p>SPU_RAWIO Allow mapping of some of the hardware
registers of the SPU into user space. This flag requires the
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability, see capabilities(7).</p>

<p>The mode parameter specifies the permissions used for
creating the new directory in spufs. mode is modified with
the user s umask(2) value and then used for both the
directory and the files contained in it. The file
permissions mask out some more bits of mode because they
typically support only read or write access. See stat(2) for
a full list of the possible mode values.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE spu_create returns a new file descriptor.
It may return -1 to indicate an error condition and set
errno to one of the error codes listed below.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCESS The current user does not have write
access on the spufs mount point.</p>

<p>EEXIST An SPU context already exists at the given path
name.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname is not a valid string pointer in the
current address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL pathname is not a directory in the spufs mount
point.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symlinks were found while resolving
pathname.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process has reached its maximum open file
limit.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system has reached the global open file
limit.</p>

<p>ENOENT Part of pathname could not be resolved.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate all resources
required.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There are not enough SPU resources available to
create a new context or the user specific limit for the
number of SPU con- texts has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOSYS the functionality is not provided by the current
system, because either the hardware does not provide SPUs or
the spufs module is not loaded.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A part of pathname is not a directory.</p>

<p>NOTES spu_create is meant to be used from libraries that
implement a more abstract interface to SPUs, not to be used
from regular applications. See
http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/ for
the rec- ommended libraries.</p>

<p>FILES pathname must point to a location beneath the
mount point of spufs. By convention, it gets mounted in
/spu.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This call is Linux specific and only
implemented by the ppc64 architec- ture. Programs using this
system call are not portable.</p>

<p>BUGS The code does not yet fully implement all features
lined out here.</p>
