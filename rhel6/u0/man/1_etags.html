<p>DESCRIPTION The etags program is used to create a tag
table file, in a format un- derstood by emacs(1); the ctags
program is used to create a similar ta- ble in a format
understood by vi(1). Both forms of the program under- stand
the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada,
Cobol, Er- lang, Forth, HTML, LaTeX, Emacs Lisp/Common Lisp,
Lua, Makefile, Pas- cal, Perl, PHP, Postscript, Python,
Prolog, Scheme and most assem- bler-like syntaxes. Both
forms read the files specified on the command line, and
write a tag table (defaults: TAGS for etags, tags for ctags)
in the current working directory. Files specified with
relative file names will be recorded in the tag table with
file names relative to the directory where the tag table
resides. If the tag table is in /dev or is the standard
output, however, the file names are made relative to the
working directory. Files specified with absolute file names
will be recorded with absolute file names. Files generated
from a source file--like a C file generated from a source
Cweb file--will be recorded with the name of the source
file. Compressed files are supported using gzip and bzip2.
The programs recognize the language used in an input file
based on its file name and contents. The --language switch
can be used to force parsing of the file names following the
switch according to the given language, overriding guesses
based on filename extensions.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Some options make sense only for the vi style
tag files produced by ctags; etags does not recognize them.
The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long
option names.</p>

<p>-a, --append Append to existing tag file. (For vi-format
tag files, see also --update.)</p>

<p>-B, --backward-search Tag files written in the format
expected by vi contain regular expression search
instructions; the -B option writes them using the delimiter
?, to search backwards through files. The de- fault is to
use the delimiter / , to search forwards through files. Only
ctags accepts this option.</p>

<p>--declarations In C and derived languages, create tags
for function declara- tions, and create tags for extern
variables unless --no-globals is used.</p>

<p>-D, --no-defines Do not create tag entries for C
preprocessor constant defini- tions and enum constants. This
may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are
tagged.</p>

<p>--globals Create tag entries for global variables in
Perl and Makefile. This is the default in C and derived
languages.</p>

<p>--no-globals Do not tag global variables in C and
derived languages. Typi- cally this reduces the file size by
one fourth.</p>

<p>-i file, --include=file Include a note in the tag file
indicating that, when searching for a tag, one should also
consult the tags file file after checking the current file.
Only etags accepts this option.</p>

<p>-I, --ignore-indentation Dont rely on indentation as
much as we normally do. Currently, this means not to assume
that a closing brace in the first col- umn is the final
brace of a function or structure definition in C and
C++.</p>

<p>-l language, --language=language Parse the following
files according to the given language. More than one such
options may be intermixed with filenames. Use --help to get
a list of the available languages and their de- fault
filename extensions. The auto language can be used to
restore automatic detection of language based on the file
name. The none language may be used to disable language
parsing al- together; only regexp matching is done in this
case (see the --regex option).</p>

<p>--members Create tag entries for variables that are
members of structure- like constructs in PHP. This is the
default for C and derived languages.</p>

<p>--no-members Do not tag member variables.</p>

<p>--packages-only Only tag packages in Ada files.</p>

<p>--parse-stdin=file May be used (only once) in place of a
file name on the command line. etags will read from standard
input and mark the produced tags as belonging to the file
FILE.</p>

<p>-o tagfile, --output=tagfile Explicit name of file for
tag table; for etags only, a file name of - means standard
output; overrides default TAGS or tags. (But ignored with -v
or -x.)</p>

<p>-r regexp, --regex=regexp</p>

<p>Make tags based on regexp matching for the files
following this option, in addition to the tags made with the
standard parsing based on language. May be freely intermixed
with filenames and the -R option. The regexps are
cumulative, i.e. each such op- tion will add to the previous
ones. The regexps are of one of the forms:
[{language}]/tagregexp/[nameregexp/]modifiers @regexfile</p>

<p>where tagregexp is used to match the tag. It should not
match useless characters. If the match is such that more
characters than needed are unavoidably matched by tagregexp,
it may be use- ful to add a nameregexp, to narrow down the
tag scope. ctags ignores regexps without a nameregexp. The
syntax of regexps is the same as in emacs. The following
character escape sequences , , hich respec- are supported: ,
\, 0 tively stand for the ASCII characters BEL, BS, DEL,
ESC, FF, NL, CR, TAB, VT. The modifiers are a sequence of 0
or more characters among i, which means to ignore case when
matching; m, which means that the tagregexp will be matched
against the whole file contents at once, rather than line by
line, and the matching sequence can match multiple lines;
and s, which implies m and means that the dot character in
tagregexp matches the newline char as well. The separator,
which is / in the examples, can be any character different
from space, tab, braces and @. If the separator char- acter
is needed inside the regular expression, it must be quoted
by preceding it with. The optional {language} prefix means
that the tag should be cre- ated only for files of language
language, and ignored otherwise. This is particularly useful
when storing many predefined regexps in a file. In its
second form, regexfile is the name of a file that con- tains
a number of arguments to the --regex= option, one per line.
Lines beginning with a space or tab are assumed to be
comments, and ignored.</p>

<p>Here are some examples. All the regexps are quoted to
protect them from shell interpretation.</p>

<p>Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
--regex=/[ t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_
t(]+&quot;([^&quot;]+)&quot;/_</p>

<p>Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line,
broken here for formatting reasons): --language=none
--regex=_ /[ t]*(ARCHITECTURE|_ CONFIGURA- TION) +[^ ]*
+OF/_ --regex=_ /[ t]*_(ATTRIBUTE|ENTITY|FUNC- TION|PACKAGE(
BODY)?_ |PROCEDURE|PRO- CESS|TYPE)[ t]+([^ t(]+)/3/_</p>

<p>Tag TCL files (this last example shows the usage of a
tagreg- exp): --lang=none --regex=/proc[ t]+([^ t]+)/1/_</p>

<p>A regexp can be preceded by {lang}, thus restricting it
to match lines of files of the specified language. Use etags
--help to obtain a list of the recognized languages. This
feature is par- ticularly useful inside regex files. A regex
file contains one regex per line. Empty lines, and those
lines beginning with space or tab are ignored. Lines
beginning with @ are references to regex files whose name
follows the @ sign. Other lines are considered regular
expressions like those following --regex. For example, the
command etags --regex=@regex.file *.c reads the regexes
contained in the file regex.file.</p>

<p>-R, --no-regex Dont do any more regexp matching on the
following files. May be freely intermixed with filenames and
the --regex option.</p>

<p>-u, --update Update tag entries for files specified on
command line, leaving tag entries for other files in place.
Currently, this is imple- mented by deleting the existing
entries for the given files and then rewriting the new
entries at the end of the tags file. It is often faster to
simply rebuild the entire tag file than to use this. Only
ctags accepts this option.</p>

<p>-v, --vgrind Instead of generating a tag file, write
index (in vgrind format) to standard output. Only ctags
accepts this option.</p>

<p>-x, --cxref Instead of generating a tag file, write a
cross reference (in cxref format) to standard output. Only
ctags accepts this op- tion.</p>

<p>-h, -H, --help Print usage information. Followed by one
or more --lan- guage=LANG prints detailed information about
how tags are creat- ed for LANG.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the current version of the program
(same as the version of the emacs etags is shipped
with).</p>
