<p>NAME telinit - change system runlevel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS telinit [OPTION]... RUNLEVEL</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION telinit may be used to change the system
runlevel.</p>

<p>The RUNLEVEL argument should be one of the multi-user
runlevels 2-5, 0 to halt the system, 6 to reboot the system
or 1 to bring the system down into single-user mode.</p>

<p>Normally you would use the shutdown(8) tool to halt or
reboot the sys- tem, or to bring it down to single-user
mode.</p>

<p>RUNLEVEL may also be S or s which will place the system
directly into single-user mode without actually stopping
processes first, you proba- bly wont want that.</p>

<p>The runlevel is changed by emitting the runlevel(7)
event, which includes the new runlevel in the RUNLEVEL
environment variable as well as the previous runlevel
(obtained from the environment or from /var/run/utmp) in the
PREVLEVEL variable.</p>

<p>telinit will write the new runlevel to /var/run/utmp and
append a new entry to /var/log/wtmp.</p>

<p>Other commands telinit may be also used to send basic
commands to the init(8) daemon for compatibility with System
V. These are:</p>

<p>Q or q to request that init(8) reload its configuration.
This is rarely necessary since Upstart watches its
configuration with inotify(7) and is deprecated by the
initctl(8) reload-configura- tion command.</p>

<p>U or u to request that the init(8) daemon re-execute
itself. This is not recommended since Upstart is currently
unable to preserve its state, but is necessary when
upgrading system libraries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e KEY=VALUE This specifies an additional
environment variable to be included in the event along with
RUNLEVEL and PREVLEVEL.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RUNLEVEL telinit will read the current
runlevel from this environment variable if set in preference
to reading from /var/run/utmp</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/utmp Where the current runlevel will be
read from; this file will also be updated with the new
runlevel.</p>

<p>/var/log/wtmp A new runlevel record will be appended to
this file for the new runlevel.</p>

<p>NOTES The Upstart init(8) daemon does not keep track of
runlevels itself, instead they are implemented entirely by
its userspace tools.</p>

<p>See runlevel(7) for more details.</p>
