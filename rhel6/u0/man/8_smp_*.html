<p>NAME smp_read_gpio - invoke READ GPIO REGISTER SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_read_gpio [--count=CO] [--help] [--hex]
[--index=IN] [--inter- face=PARAMS] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR]
[--type=TY] [--verbose] [--ver- sion] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) READ
GPIO REGISTER request to a SMP target. The SMP target is
identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on
the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the
SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE per
machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>This function is defined in SFF-8485 ( see
www.sffcommittee.com ) together with its corresponding WRITE
GPIO REGISTER SMP function. The other SMP functions are
defined in SAS documents at www.t10.org . SFF-8485 defines a
curious device called a &quot;virtual SMP port&quot; that
lives in a host bus adapter (HBA) and allows SMP to
manipulate the sideband signals on wide internal cables. To
stop other initiators in a multi-initiator domain from
accessing those sideband signals, the vir- tual SMP (target)
port is not indicated in a DISCOVER response.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --count=CO where CO is the register count. This is
the number of (4 byte) registers to request. The default
value is 1.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --index=IN where IN is the register index. This
value is origin zero and its default value is 0. If the
request succeeds, then --count=CO registers starting from
--index=IN of the given --type=TY should be in the
response.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-t, --type=TY where TY is the register type. The default
value is 0 (GPIO_CFG). If the request succeeds, then
--count=CO registers starting from --index=IN of the given
--type=TY should be in the response.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP READ GPIO REGISTER function is
defined in SFF-8485 (see www.sffcommittee.com ) together
with its corresponding WRITE GPIO REG- ISTER SMP
function.</p>
