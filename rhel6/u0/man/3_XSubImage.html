<p>XCreateImage(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XCreateImage(3)</p>

<p>NAME XInitImage, XCreateImage, XGetPixel, XPutPixel,
XSubImage, XAddPixel, XDestroyImage - image utilities</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XInitImage(XImage *image);</p>

<p>XImage *XCreateImage(Display *display, Visual *visual,
unsigned int depth, int format, int offset, char *data,
unsigned int width, unsigned int height, int bitmap_pad, int
bytes_per_line);</p>

<p>unsigned long XGetPixel(XImage *ximage, int x, int
y);</p>

<p>int XPutPixel(XImage *ximage, int x, int y, unsigned
long pixel);</p>

<p>XImage *XSubImage(XImage *ximage, int x, int y, unsigned
int subim- age_width, unsigned int subimage_height);</p>

<p>int XAddPixel(XImage *ximage, long value);</p>

<p>int XDestroyImage(XImage *ximage);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS bitmap_pad Specifies the quantum of a scanline
(8, 16, or 32). In other words, the start of one scanline is
separated in client mem- ory from the start of the next
scanline by an integer multi- ple of this many bits.</p>

<p>bytes_per_line Specifies the number of bytes in the
client image between the start of one scanline and the start
of the next.</p>

<p>data Specifies the image data.</p>

<p>depth Specifies the depth of the image.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>format Specifies the format for the image. You can pass
XYBitmap, XYPixmap, or ZPixmap.</p>

<p>height Specifies the height of the image, in pixels.</p>

<p>offset Specifies the number of pixels to ignore at the
beginning of the scanline.</p>

<p>pixel Specifies the new pixel value.</p>

<p>subimage_height Specifies the height of the new
subimage, in pixels.</p>

<p>subimage_width Specifies the width of the new subimage,
in pixels.</p>

<p>value Specifies the constant value that is to be
added.</p>

<p>visual Specifies the Visual structure.</p>

<p>width Specifies the width of the image, in pixels.</p>

<p>ximage Specifies the image.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XInitImage function initializes the
internal image manipulation routines of an image structure,
based on the values of the various structure members. All
fields other than the manipulation routines must already be
initialized. If the bytes_per_line member is zero,
XInitImage will assume the image data is contiguous in
memory and set the bytes_per_line member to an appropriate
value based on the other members; otherwise, the value of
bytes_per_line is not changed. All of the manipulation
routines are initialized to functions that other Xlib image
manipulation functions need to operate on the type of image
spec- ified by the rest of the structure.</p>

<p>This function must be called for any image constructed
by the client before passing it to any other Xlib function.
Image structures created or returned by Xlib do not need to
be initialized in this fashion.</p>

<p>This function returns a nonzero status if initialization
of the struc- ture is successful. It returns zero if it
detected some error or inconsistency in the structure, in
which case the image is not changed.</p>

<p>The XCreateImage function allocates the memory needed
for an XImage structure for the specified display but does
not allocate space for the image itself. Rather, it
initializes the structure byte-order, bit- order, and
bitmap-unit values from the display and returns a pointer to
the XImage structure. The red, green, and blue mask values
are defined for Z format images only and are derived from
the Visual structure passed in. Other values also are passed
in. The offset permits the rapid displaying of the image
without requiring each scanline to be shifted into position.
If you pass a zero value in bytes_per_line, Xlib assumes
that the scanlines are contiguous in memory and calculates
the value of bytes_per_line itself.</p>

<p>Note that when the image is created using XCreateImage,
XGetImage, or XSubImage, the destroy procedure that the
XDestroyImage function calls frees both the image structure
and the data pointed to by the image structure.</p>

<p>The basic functions used to get a pixel, set a pixel,
create a subim- age, and add a constant value to an image
are defined in the image object. The functions in this
section are really macro invocations of the functions in the
image object and are defined in &lt;X11/Xutil.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The XGetPixel function returns the specified pixel from
the named image. The pixel value is returned in normalized
format (that is, the least significant byte of the long is
the least significant byte of the pixel). The image must
contain the x and y coordinates.</p>

<p>The XPutPixel function overwrites the pixel in the named
image with the specified pixel value. The input pixel value
must be in normalized format (that is, the least significant
byte of the long is the least significant byte of the
pixel). The image must contain the x and y coordinates.</p>

<p>The XSubImage function creates a new image that is a
subsection of an existing one. It allocates the memory
necessary for the new XImage structure and returns a pointer
to the new image. The data is copied from the source image,
and the image must contain the rectangle defined by x, y,
subimage_width, and subimage_height.</p>

<p>The XAddPixel function adds a constant value to every
pixel in an image. It is useful when you have a base pixel
value from allocating color resources and need to manipulate
the image to that form.</p>

<p>The XDestroyImage function deallocates the memory
associated with the XImage structure.</p>
