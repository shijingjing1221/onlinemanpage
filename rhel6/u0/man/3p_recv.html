<p>RECV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RECV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME recv - receive a message from a connected
socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t recv(int socket, void *buffer, size_t length,
int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The recv() function shall receive a message
from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is
normally used with connected sockets because it does not
permit the application to retrieve the source address of
received data.</p>

<p>The recv() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the socket file descriptor.</p>

<p>buffer Points to a buffer where the message should be
stored.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer
pointed to by the buffer argument.</p>

<p>flags Specifies the type of message reception. Values of
this argument are formed by logically ORing zero or more of
the following values:</p>

<p>MSG_PEEK Peeks at an incoming message. The data is
treated as unread and the next recv() or similar function
shall still return this data.</p>

<p>MSG_OOB Requests out-of-band data. The significance and
semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.</p>

<p>MSG_WAITALL On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that
the function block until the full amount of data can be
returned. The function may return the smaller amount of data
if the socket is a message- based socket, if a signal is
caught, if the connection is termi- nated, if MSG_PEEK was
specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.</p>

<p>The recv() function shall return the length of the
message written to the buffer pointed to by the buffer
argument. For message-based sock- ets, such as SOCK_DGRAM
and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a
single operation. If a message is too long to fit in the
supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the flags
argument, the excess bytes shall be discarded. For
stream-based sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message
boundaries shall be ignored. In this case, data shall be
returned to the user as soon as it becomes available, and no
data shall be discarded.</p>

<p>If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be
returned only up to the end of the first message.</p>

<p>If no messages are available at the socket and
O_NONBLOCK is not set on the sockets file descriptor, recv()
shall block until a message arrives. If no messages are
available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is set on the sockets
file descriptor, recv() shall fail and set errno to [EAGAIN]
or [EWOULDBLOCK].</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, recv() shall
return the length of the mes- sage in bytes. If no messages
are available to be received and the peer has performed an
orderly shutdown, recv() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The recv() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK</p>

<p>The socket s file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no
data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no
out-of-band data is available and either the sockets file
descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not
support blocking to await out-of-band data.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET A connection was forcibly closed by a
peer.</p>

<p>EINTR The recv() function was interrupted by a signal
that was caught, before any data was available.</p>

<p>EINVAL The MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data
is available.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN A receive is attempted on a connection-mode
socket that is not connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The specified flags are not supported for
this socket type or protocol.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The connection timed out during connection
establishment, or due to a transmission timeout on active
connection.</p>

<p>The recv() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The recv() function is equivalent to
recvfrom() with a zero address_len argument, and to read()
if no flags are used.</p>

<p>The select() and poll() functions can be used to
determine when data is available to be received.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
