<p>NAME pamditherbw - dither grayscale image to black and
white</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamditherbw</p>

<p>[-floyd | -fs | -atkinson | -threshold | -hilbert |
-dither8 | -d8 | -cluster3 | -c3 | -cluster4 | -c4 |
-cluster8 | -c8]</p>

<p>[-value val]</p>

<p>[-clump size]</p>

<p>[pamfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamditherbw dithers a grayscale image. Dithering means
turning each shade of gray into a pattern of black and white
pixels that, from a distance, look the same as the gray.</p>

<p>The input should be a PGM image or a PAM image of tuple
type GRAYSCALE. However, pamditherbw doesnt check, so if you
feed it e.g. a PPM image, it will produce arbitrary results
(actually, it just takes the first channel of whatever you
give it and treats it as if it represented gray levels).</p>

<p>The output is a PAM with tuple type BLACKANDWHITE. You
can turn this into a PBM (if you need to use it with an
older program doesnt under- stand PAM) with pamtopnm.</p>

<p>To do the opposite of dithering, you can usually just
scale the image down and then back up again with pamscale,
possibly smoothing or blur- ring the result with pnmsmooth
or pnmconvol. Or use the special case program pbmtopgm.</p>

<p>To dither a color image (to reduce the number of pixel
colors), use ppmdither.</p>

<p>Another way to convert a grayscale image to a black and
white image is thresholding. Thresholding is simply
replacing each grayscale pixel with a black or white pixel
depending on whether its brightness is above or below a
threshold. That threshold might vary. Simple thresh- olding
is a degenerate case of dithering, so pamditherbw does very
sim- ple thresholding with its -threshold option. But
pamthreshold does more sophisticated thresholding.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The default quantization method is
boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion (-floyd or
-fs).</p>

<p>Also available are simple thresholding (-threshold);
Bayers ordered dither (-dither8) with a 16x16 matrix;
Atkinson ; and three different sizes of 45-degree
clustered-dot dither (-cluster3, -cluster4, -cluster8).</p>

<p>A space filling curve halftoning method using the
Hilbert curve is also available (-hilbert).</p>

<p>Floyd-Steinberg or Atkinson will almost always give the
best looking results; however, looking good is not always
what you want. For instance, you can use thresholding in a
pipeline with the pnmconvol, for tasks such as edge and peak
detection. And clustered-dot dithering gives a newspaper-ish
look, a useful special effect.</p>

<p>Floyd-Steinberg is by far the more traditional, but some
claim Atkinson works better.</p>

<p>The -value option alters the thresholding value for
Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, and simple thresholding. It
should be a real number between 0 and 1. Above 0.5 means
darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.</p>

<p>The Hilbert curve method is useful for processing images
before display on devices that do not render individual
pixels distinctly (like laser printers). This dithering
method can give better results than the dithering usually
done by the laser printers themselves. The -clump option
alters the number of pixels in a clump. This is usually an
integer between 2 and 100 (default 5). Smaller clump sizes
smear the image less and are less grainy, but seem to lose
some grey scale lin- earity. Typically a PGM image will have
to be scaled to fit on a laser printer page (2400 x 3000
pixels for an A4 300 dpi page), and then dithered to a PBM
image before being converted to a postscript file. A
printing pipeline might look something like:</p>

<p>pamscale -xysize 2400 3000 image.pgm | pamditherbw
-hilbert | pamtopnm | pnmtops -scale 0.25 &gt; image.ps</p>

<p>HISTORY pamditherbw was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004),
but is essentially the same program as pgmtopbm that has
existed practically since the begin- ning. pamditherbw
differs from its predecessor in that it properly adds
brightnesses (using gamma transformations; pgmtopbm just
adds them linearly) and that it accepts PAM input in
addition to PGM and PBM and produces PAM output.</p>

<p>pamditherbw obsoletes pgmtopbm.</p>

<p>-atkinson was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).</p>
