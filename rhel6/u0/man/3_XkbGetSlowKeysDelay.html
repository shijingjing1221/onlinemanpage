<p>XkbGetSlowKeysDelay(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetSlowKeysDelay(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetSlowKeysDelay - Gets the SlowKeys acceptance
delay for a keyboard device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbGetSlowKeysDelay (Display *display,
unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int *delay_rtrn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - display connection to X server</p>

<p>- device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>- delay_rtrn backfilled with SlowKeys delay, ms</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some users may accidentally bump keys while
moving a hand or typing stick toward the key they want.
Usually, the keys that are accidentally bumped are just hit
for a very short period of time. The SlowKeys con- trol
helps filter these accidental bumps by telling the server to
wait a specified period, called the SlowKeys acceptance
delay, before deliv- ering key events. If the key is
released before this period elapses, no key events are
generated. Users can then bump any number of keys on their
way to the one they want without accidentally getting those
char- acters. Once they have reached the key they want, they
can then hold the desired key long enough for the computer
to accept it. SlowKeys is a boolean control with one
configurable attribute.</p>

<p>When the SlowKeys control is active, the server reports
the initial key press, subsequent acceptance or rejection,
and release of any key to interested clients by sending an
appropriate AccessXNotify event (see section 10.6.4).</p>

<p>The server can generate XkbAccessXNotify events for some
of the global keyboard controls. The detail field describes
what AccessX event just occurred and can be any of the
values in Table 1. The server can gen- erate
XkbAccessXNotify events for some of the global keyboard
controls. The detail field describes what AccessX event just
occurred and can be any of the values in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1 AccessXNotify Events
-------------------------------------------------------------
detail Reason
-------------------------------------------------------------
XkbAXN_SKPress A key was pressed when SlowKeys was enabled.
XkbAXN_SKAccept A key was accepted (held longer than the
SlowKeys delay). XkbAXN_SKRelease An accepted SlowKeys key
was released. XkbAXN_SKReject A key was rejected (released
before the SlowKeys delay expired). XkbAXN_BKAccept A key
was accepted by BounceKeys. XkbAXN_BKReject A key was
rejected (pressed before the BounceKeys delay expired).
XkbAXN_AXKWarning AccessXKeys is about to turn on/off
StickyKeys or BounceKeys.</p>

<p>The keycode field reports the keycode of the key for
which the event occurred. If the action is related to
SlowKeys, the slowKeysDelay field contains the current
SlowKeys acceptance delay. If the action is related to
BounceKeys, the debounceDelay field contains the current
BounceKeys debounce delay.</p>

<p>Selecting for AccessX Events</p>

<p>To receive XkbAccessXNotify events under all possible
conditions, use XkbSelectEvents and pass XkbAccesXNotifyMask
in both bits_to_change and values_for_bits.</p>

<p>To receive XkbStateNotify events only under certain
conditions, use XkbSelectEventDetails using XkbAccessXNotify
as the event_type and specifying the desired state changes
in bits_to_change and val- ues_for_bits using mask bits from
Table 2.</p>

<p>Table 2 AccessXNotify Event Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbAccessXNotify Event Details Value Circumstances
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbAXN_SKPressMask (1&lt;&lt;0) Slow key press notification
wanted XkbAXN_SKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;1) Slow key accept
notification wanted XkbAXN_SKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;2) Slow
key reject notification wanted XkbAXN_SKReleaseMask
(1&lt;&lt;3) Slow key release notification wanted
XkbAXN_BKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;4) Bounce key accept
notification wanted XkbAXN_BKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;5) Bounce
key reject notification wanted XkbAXN_AXKWarningMask
(1&lt;&lt;6) AccessX warning notification wanted
XkbAXN_AllEventsMask (0x7f) All AccessX features notifica-
tions wanted</p>

<p>XkbGetSlowKeysDelay requests the attributes of the
SlowKeys control from the server, waits for a reply and
backfills delay_rtrn with the SlowKeys delay attribute.
XkbGetSlowKeysDelay returns True if success- ful; ,
XkbGetSlowKeysDelay returns False.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES True The XkbGetSlowKeysDelay function
returns True if the request of the Slowkeys control from the
server was suc- cessful.</p>

<p>False The XkbGetSlowKeysDelay function returns False if
a com- patible version of the Xkb extension is not available
in the server.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for the XkbAccessXNotify event
type is as follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; / Xkb extension base event
code */ unsigned long serial; / X server serial number for
event */ Bool send_event; / True =&gt; synthetically
generated */ Display * display; / server connection where
event generated */ Time time; / server time when event
generated */ int xkb_type; / XkbAccessXNotify */ int device;
/ Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */ int detail; /
XkbAXN_* */ KeyCode keycode; / key of event */ int
slowKeysDelay; / current SlowKeys delay */ int
debounceDelay; / current debounce delay */ }
