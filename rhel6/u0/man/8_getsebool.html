<p>getsebool(8) SELinux Command Line documentation
getsebool(8)</p>

<p>NAME getsebool - get SELinux boolean value(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getsebool [-a] [boolean]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getsebool reports where a particular SELinux
boolean or all SELinux booleans are on or off In certain
situations a boolean can be in one state with a pending
change to the other state. getsebool will report this as a
pending change. The pending value indicates the value that
will be applied upon the next boolean commit.</p>

<p>The setting of boolean values occurs in two stages;
first the pending value is changed, then the booleans are
committed, causing their active values to become their
pending values. This allows a group of booleans to be
changed in a single transaction, by setting all of their
pending values as desired and then committing once.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Show all SELinux booleans.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO selinux(8), setsebool(8), booleans(8)</p>
