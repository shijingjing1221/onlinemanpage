<p>DESCRIPTION The procedures described here are utilities
for manipulating the result value in a Tcl interpreter. The
interpreter result may be either a Tcl object or a string.
For example, Tcl_SetObjResult and Tcl_SetResult set the
interpreter result to, respectively, an object and a string.
Similarly, Tcl_GetObjResult and Tcl_GetStringResult return
the inter- preter result as an object and as a string. The
procedures always keep the string and object forms of the
interpreter result consistent. For example, if
Tcl_SetObjResult is called to set the result to an object,
then Tcl_GetStringResult is called, it will return the
objects string value.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetObjResult arranges for objPtr to be the result
for interp, replacing any existing result. The result is
left pointing to the object referenced by objPtr. objPtrs
reference count is incremented since there is now a new
reference to it from interp. The reference count for any old
result object is decremented and the old result object is
freed if no references to it remain.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetObjResult returns the result for interp as an
object. The object s reference count is not incremented; if
the caller needs to retain a long-term pointer to the object
they should use Tcl_IncrRef- Count to increment its
reference count in order to keep it from being freed too
early or accidentally changed.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetResult arranges for result to be the result for
the current Tcl command in interp, replacing any existing
result. The freeProc argu- ment specifies how to manage the
storage for the result argument; it is discussed in the
section THE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT below. If
result is NULL, then freeProc is ignored and Tcl_SetResult
re-initializes interps result to point to an empty
string.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetStringResult returns the result for interp as a
string. If the result was set to an object by a
Tcl_SetObjResult call, the object form will be converted to
a string and returned. If the objects string representation
contains null bytes, this conversion will lose informa-
tion. For this reason, programmers are encouraged to write
their code to use the new object API procedures and to call
Tcl_GetObjResult instead.</p>

<p>Tcl_ResetResult clears the result for interp and leaves
the result in its normal empty initialized state. If the
result is an object, its reference count is decremented and
the result is left pointing to an unshared object
representing an empty string. If the result is a dynamically
allocated string, its memory is free*d and the result is
left as a empty string. Tcl_ResetResult also clears the
error state managed by Tcl_AddErrorInfo,
Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo, and Tcl_SetErrorCode.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendResult makes it easy to build up Tcl results
in pieces. It takes each of its result arguments and appends
them in order to the current result associated with interp.
If the result is in its ini- tialized empty state (e.g. a
command procedure was just invoked or Tcl_ResetResult was
just called), then Tcl_AppendResult sets the result to the
concatenation of its result arguments. Tcl_AppendResult may
be called repeatedly as additional pieces of the result are
produced. Tcl_AppendResult takes care of all the storage
management issues asso- ciated with managing interp s
result, such as allocating a larger result area if
necessary. It also manages conversion to and from the result
field of the interp so as to handle backward-compatability
with old-style extensions. Any number of result arguments
may be passed in a single call; the last argument in the
list must be a NULL pointer.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendResultVA is the same as Tcl_AppendResult
except that instead of taking a variable number of arguments
it takes an argument list.</p>

<p>OLD STRING PROCEDURES Use of the following procedures
(is deprecated since they manipulate the Tcl result as a
string. Procedures such as Tcl_SetObjResult that manipulate
the result as an object can be significantly more
efficient.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendElement is similar to Tcl_AppendResult in that
it allows results to be built up in pieces. However,
Tcl_AppendElement takes only a single element argument and
it appends that argument to the current result as a proper
Tcl list element. Tcl_AppendElement adds backslashes or
braces if necessary to ensure that interps result can be
parsed as a list and that element will be extracted as a
single ele- ment. Under normal conditions, Tcl_AppendElement
will add a space character to interps result just before
adding the new list element, so that the list elements in
the result are properly separated. How- ever if the new list
element is the first in a list or sub-list (i.e. interp s
current result is empty, or consists of the single character
{, or ends in the characters {) then no space is added.</p>

<p>Tcl_FreeResult performs part of the work of
Tcl_ResetResult. It frees up the memory associated with
interps result. It also sets interp-&gt;freeProc to zero,
but does not change interp-&gt;result or clear error state.
Tcl_FreeResult is most commonly used when a procedure is
about to replace one result value with another.</p>

<p>DIRECT ACCESS TO INTERP-&gt;RESULT IS DEPRECATED It used
to be legal for programs to directly read and write
interp-&gt;result to manipulate the interpreter result.
Direct access to interp-&gt;result is now strongly
deprecated because it can make the result s string and
object forms inconsistent. Programs should always read the
result using the procedures Tcl_GetObjResult or Tcl_Get-
StringResult, and write the result using Tcl_SetObjResult or
Tcl_SetRe- sult.</p>

<p>THE TCL_FREEPROC ARGUMENT TO TCL_SETRESULT
Tcl_SetResults freeProc argument specifies how the Tcl
system is to manage the storage for the result argument. If
Tcl_SetResult or Tcl_SetObjResult are called at a time when
interp holds a string result, they do whatever is necessary
to dispose of the old string result (see the Tcl_Interp
manual entry for details on this).</p>

<p>If freeProc is TCL_STATIC it means that result refers to
an area of static storage that is guaranteed not to be
modified until at least the next call to Tcl_Eval. If
freeProc is TCL_DYNAMIC it means that result was allocated
with a call to Tcl_Alloc and is now the property of the Tcl
system. Tcl_SetResult will arrange for the strings storage
to be released by calling Tcl_Free when it is no longer
needed. If freeProc is TCL_VOLATILE it means that result
points to an area of memory that is likely to be overwritten
when Tcl_SetResult returns (e.g. it points to something in a
stack frame). In this case Tcl_SetResult will make a copy of
the string in dynamically allocated storage and arrange for
the copy to be the result for the current Tcl command.</p>

<p>If freeProc is not one of the values TCL_STATIC,
TCL_DYNAMIC, and TCL_VOLATILE, then it is the address of a
procedure that Tcl should call to free the string. This
allows applications to use non-standard storage allocators.
When Tcl no longer needs the storage for the string, it will
call freeProc. FreeProc should have arguments and result
that match the type Tcl_FreeProc: typedef void
Tcl_FreeProc(char *blockPtr); When freeProc is called, its
blockPtr will be set to the value of result passed to
Tcl_SetResult.</p>
