<p>BATCH(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BATCH(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME batch - schedule commands to be executed in a batch
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS batch</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The batch utility shall read commands from
standard input and schedule them for execution in a batch
queue. It shall be the equivalent of the command:</p>

<p>at -q b -m now</p>

<p>where queue b is a special at queue, specifically for
batch jobs. Batch jobs shall be submitted to the batch queue
with no time constraints and shall be run by the system
using algorithms, based on unspecified fac- tors, that may
vary with each invocation of batch.</p>

<p>Users shall be permitted to use batch if their name
appears in the file /usr/lib/cron/at.allow. If that file
does not exist, the file /usr/lib/cron/at.deny shall be
checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access
to batch. If neither file exists, only a pro- cess with the
appropriate privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If
only at.deny exists and is empty, global usage shall be
permitted. The at.allow and at.deny files shall consist of
one user name per line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be a text file consisting
of commands accept- able to the shell command language
described in Shell Command Language .</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The text files /usr/lib/cron/at.allow and
/usr/lib/cron/at.deny shall contain zero or more user names,
one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized or
denied access to the at and batch utili- ties.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of batch:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents for date and
time strings written by batch.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>SHELL Determine the name of a command interpreter to be
used to invoke the at-job. If the variable is unset or null,
sh shall be used. If it is set to a value other than a name
for sh, the implemen- tation shall do one of the following:
use that shell; use sh; use the login shell from the user
database; any of the preceding accompanied by a warning
diagnostic about which was chosen.</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted
for execution at the time specified by timespec or -t time
relative to the timezone specified by the TZ variable. If
timespec specifies a timezone, it overrides TZ. If timespec
does not specify a time- zone and TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When standard input is a terminal, prompts of
unspecified format for each line of the user input described
in the STDIN section may be writ- ten to standard
output.</p>

<p>STDERR The following shall be written to standard error
when a job has been successfully submitted:</p>

<p>&quot;job %s at %n&quot;, at_job_id, &lt;date&gt;</p>

<p>where date shall be equivalent in format to the output
of:</p>

<p>date +&quot;%a %b %e %T %Y&quot;</p>

<p>The date and time written shall be adjusted so that they
appear in the timezone of the user (as determined by the TZ
variable).</p>

<p>Neither this, nor warning messages concerning the
selection of the com- mand interpreter, are considered a
diagnostic that changes the exit status.</p>

<p>Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to
standard error.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The job shall not be
scheduled.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE It may be useful to redirect standard
output within the specified com- mands.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:</p>

<p>batch sort &lt; file &gt;outfile EOT</p>

<p>2. This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting
standard error to a pipe, is useful in a command procedure
(the sequence of output redirection specifications is
significant):</p>

<p>batch &lt;&lt; ! diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1
&gt;outfile | mailx mygroup !</p>

<p>RATIONALE Early proposals described batch in a manner
totally separated from at, even though the historical model
treated it almost as a synonym for at -qb. A number of
features were added to list and control batch work
separately from those in at. Upon further reflection, it was
decided that the benefit of this did not merit the change to
the historical interface.</p>

<p>The -m option was included on the equivalent at command
because it is historical practice to mail results to the
submitter, even if all job- produced output is redirected.
As explained in the RATIONALE for at, the now keyword
submits the job for immediate execution (after schedul- ing
delays), despite some historical systems where at now would
have been considered an error.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
