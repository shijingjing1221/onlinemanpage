<p>BZDIFF(1) BZDIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME bzcmp, bzdiff - compare bzip2 compressed files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bzcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ] bzdiff [
diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Bzcmp and bzdiff are used to invoke the cmp
or the diff program on bzip2 compressed files. All options
specified are passed directly to cmp or diff. If only 1 file
is specified, then the files compared are file1 and an
uncompressed file1.bz2. If two files are specified, then
they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff.
The exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cmp(1), diff(1), bzmore(1), bzless(1),
bzgrep(1), bzip2(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Messages from the cmp or diff programs refer to
temporary filenames instead of those specified.</p>
