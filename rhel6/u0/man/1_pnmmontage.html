<p>NAME pnmmontage - create a montage of PNM images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmmontage</p>

<p>[-header=headerfile]</p>

<p>[-quality=n]</p>

<p>[-prefix=prefix]</p>

<p>[-0|-1|-2|...|-9]</p>

<p>[-data=filename]</p>

<p>pnmfile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmmontage packs images of differing sizes into a
minimum-area compos- ite image, optionally producing a C
header file with the locations of the subimages within the
composite image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -data=filename This option causes pnmmontage to
write a file that describes in machine-readable form the
positions of the original images within the packed image.
Here is an example:</p>

<p>:0:0:227:298 ../image1.ppm:0:0:227:149
../image2.ppm:0:149:227:149</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002).</p>

<p>-header=filename Tells pnmmontage to write a C header
file of the locations of the original images within the
packed image. Each original image generates four #defines
within the packed file: xxxX, xxxY, xxxSZX, and xxxSZY,
where xxx is the name of the file, converted to all
uppercase. The output also includes #defines OVERALLX and
OVERALLY, which specifies the total size of the montage
image.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>#define OVERALLX 227 #define OVERALLY 298</p>

<p>#define X 0 #define Y 0 #define SZX 227 #define SZY
149</p>

<p>#define X 0 #define Y 149 #define SZX 227 #define SZY
149</p>

<p>-prefix Tells pnmmontage to use the specified prefix on
all of the #defines it generates.</p>

<p>-quality Before attempting to place the subimages,
pnmmontage will calcu- late a minimum possible area for the
montage; this is either the total of the areas of all the
subimages, or the width of the widest subimage times the
height of the tallest subimage, whichever is greater.
pnmmontage then initiates a problem-space search to find the
best packing; if it finds a solution that is (at least) as
good as the minimum area times the quality as a percent, it
will break out of the search. Thus, -quality=100 will find
the best possible solution; however, it may take a very long
time to do so. The default is -quality=200.</p>

<p>-0, -1, ... -9 These options control the quality at a
higher level than -q; -0 is the worst quality (literally
pick the first solution found), while -9 is the best quality
(perform an exhaustive search of problem space for the
absolute best packing). The higher the number, the slower
the computation. The default is -5.</p>

<p>NOTES Using -9 is excessively slow on all but the
smallest image sets. If the input images differ in maxvals,
then pnmmontage will pick the smallest maxval which is
evenly divisible by each of the maxvals of the original
images.</p>

<p>The minimum area arrangement is often not a convenient
shape. For example, it might be a tall, thin column of
images, when youd rather have something more square. To
force a minimum width or height, you can include a strut
image - a black image that wide and one pixel high.
Similarly, you can use a vertical strut to force a minimum
height.</p>
