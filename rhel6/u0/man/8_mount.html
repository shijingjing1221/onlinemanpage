<p>MOUNT(8) Linux Programmer s Manual MOUNT(8)</p>

<p>NAME mount - mount a filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mount [-lhV]</p>

<p>mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-O optlist]</p>

<p>mount [-fnrsvw] [-o option[,option]...] device|dir</p>

<p>mount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All files accessible in a Unix system are
arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /.
These files can be spread out over sev- eral devices. The
mount command serves to attach the filesystem found on some
device to the big file tree. Conversely, the umount(8)
command will detach it again.</p>

<p>The standard form of the mount command, is</p>

<p>mount -t type device dir</p>

<p>This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on
device (which is of type type) at the directory dir. The
previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of dir become
invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted,
the pathname dir refers to the root of the filesystem on
device.</p>

<p>The listing and help. Three forms of invocation do not
actually mount anything:</p>

<p>mount -h prints a help message</p>

<p>mount -V prints a version string</p>

<p>mount [-l] [-t type] lists all mounted filesystems (of
type type). The option -l adds the labels in this listing.
See below.</p>

<p>The device indication. Most devices are indicated by a
file name (of a block special device), like /dev/sda1, but
there are other possibilities. For example, in the case of
an NFS mount, device may look like knuth.cwi.nl:/dir. It is
possible to indicate a block special device using its volume
LABEL or UUID (see the -L and -U options below).</p>

<p>The recommended setup is to use LABEL=&lt;label&gt; or
UUID=&lt;uuid&gt; tags rather than /dev/disk/by-{label,uuid}
udev symlinks in the /etc/fstab file. The tags are more
readable, robust and portable. The mount(8) command
internally uses udev symlinks, so use the symlinks in
/etc/fstab is not advantage over LABEL=/UUID=. For more
details see libblkid(3).</p>

<p>The proc filesystem is not associated with a special
device, and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as
proc can be used instead of a device specification. (The
customary choice none is less fortunate: the error message
none busy from umount can be confusing.)</p>

<p>The /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts files. The
file /etc/fstab (see fstab(5)), may contain lines describing
what devices are usually mounted where, using which
options.</p>

<p>The command</p>

<p>mount -a [-t type] [-O optlist]</p>

<p>(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems
mentioned in fstab (of the proper type and/or having or not
having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated,
except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword.
Adding the -F option will make mount fork, so that the
filesystems are mounted simul- taneously.</p>

<p>When mounting a filesystem mentioned in fstab or mtab,
it suf- fices to give only the device, or only the mount
point.</p>

<p>The programs mount and umount maintain a list of
currently mounted filesystems in the file /etc/mtab. If no
arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.</p>

<p>The mount program does not read the /etc/fstab file if
device (or LABEL/UUID) and dir are specified. For
example:</p>

<p>mount /dev/foo /dir</p>

<p>If you want to override mount options from /etc/fstab
you have to use:</p>

<p>mount device|dir -o &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>and then the mount options from command line will be
appended to the list of options from /etc/fstab. The usual
behaviour is that the last option wins if there is more
duplicated options.</p>

<p>When the proc filesystem is mounted (say at /proc), the
files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts have very similar contents.
The for- mer has somewhat more information, such as the
mount options used, but is not necessarily up-to-date (cf.
the -n option below). It is possible to replace /etc/mtab by
a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, and especially when you
have very large numbers of mounts things will be much faster
with that symlink, but some information is lost that way,
and in particular using the &quot;user&quot; option will
fail.</p>

<p>The non-superuser mounts. Normally, only the superuser
can mount filesystems. However, when fstab contains the user
option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding
system.</p>

<p>Thus, given a line</p>

<p>/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide</p>

<p>any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on his
CDROM using the command</p>

<p>mount /dev/cdrom</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>mount /cd</p>

<p>For more details, see fstab(5). Only the user that
mounted a filesystem can unmount it again. If any user
should be able to unmount, then use users instead of user in
the fstab line. The owner option is similar to the user
option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner
of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for /dev/fd if
a login script makes the console user owner of this device.
The group option is similar, with the restriction that the
user must be member of the group of the special file.</p>

<p>The bind mounts. Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to
remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. The call
is mount --bind olddir newdir or shortoption mount -B olddir
newdir or fstab entry is: /olddir /newdir none bind</p>

<p>After this call the same contents is accessible in two
places. One can also remount a single file (on a single
file).</p>

<p>This call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem,
not pos- sible submounts. The entire file hierarchy
including submounts is attached a second place using mount
--rbind olddir newdir or shortoption mount -R olddir
newdir</p>

<p>Note that the filesystem mount options will remain the
same as those on the original mount point, and cannot be
changed by passing the -o option along with --bind/--rbind.
The mount options can be changed by a separate remount
command, for exam- ple:</p>

<p>mount --bind olddir newdir mount -o remount,ro
newdir</p>

<p>The move operation. Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to
atomically move a mounted tree to another place. The call is
mount --move olddir newdir or shortoption mount -M olddir
newdir This will cause the contents which previously
appeared under olddir to be accessed under newdir. The
physical location of the files is not changed.</p>

<p>The shared subtrees operations. Since Linux 2.6.15 it is
possible to mark a mount and its sub- mounts as shared,
private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount provides
ability to create mirrors of that mount such that mounts and
umounts within any of the mirrors propagate to the other
mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its mas-
ter, but any not vice-versa. A private mount carries no
propa- gation abilities. A unbindable mount is a private
mount which cannot cloned through a bind operation. Detailed
semantics is documented in Documentation/sharedsubtree.txt
file in the kernel source tree.</p>

<p>mount --make-shared mountpoint mount --make-slave
mountpoint mount --make-private mountpoint mount
--make-unbindable mountpoint</p>

<p>The following commands allows one to recursively change
the type of all the mounts under a given mountpoint.</p>

<p>mount --make-rshared mountpoint mount --make-rslave
mountpoint mount --make-rprivate mountpoint mount
--make-runbindable mountpoint</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The full set of mount options used
by an invocation of mount is deter- mined by first
extracting the mount options for the filesystem from the
fstab table, then applying any options specified by the -o
argument, and finally applying a -r or -w option, when
present.</p>

<p>Command line options available for the mount
command:</p>

<p>-V, --version Output version.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a help message.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-a, --all Mount all filesystems (of the given types)
mentioned in fstab.</p>

<p>-F, --fork (Used in conjunction with -a.) Fork off a new
incarnation of mount for each device. This will do the
mounts on different devices or different NFS servers in
parallel. This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS
timeouts go in parallel. A disadvantage is that the mounts
are done in undefined order. Thus, you cannot use this
option if you want to mount both /usr and /usr/spool.</p>

<p>-f, --fake Causes everything to be done except for the
actual system call; if it s not obvious, this fakes mounting
the filesystem. This option is useful in conjunction with
the -v flag to deter- mine what the mount command is trying
to do. It can also be used to add entries for devices that
were mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f option
checks for existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the
record already exists (with regular non-fake mount, this
check is done by kernel).</p>

<p>-i, --internal-only Don t call the
/sbin/mount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper even if it exists.</p>

<p>-l Add the labels in the mount output. Mount must have
permission to read the disk device (e.g. be suid root) for
this to work. One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or
ext4 using the e2label(8) utility, or for XFS using
xfs_admin(8), or for reis- erfs using reiserfstune(8).</p>

<p>-n, --no-mtab Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This
is necessary for exam- ple when /etc is on a read-only
filesystem.</p>

<p>--no-canonicalize Don t canonicalize paths. The mount
command canonicalizes all paths (from command line or fstab)
and stores canonicalized paths to the /etc/mtab file. This
option can be used together with the -f flag for already
canonicalized absolut paths.</p>

<p>-p, --pass-fd num In case of a loop mount with
encryption, read the passphrase from file descriptor num
instead of from the terminal.</p>

<p>-s Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing.
This will ignore mount options not supported by a filesystem
type. Not all filesystems support this option. This option
exists for support of the Linux autofs-based
automounter.</p>

<p>-r, --read-only Mount the filesystem read-only. A
synonym is -o ro.</p>

<p>Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and
kernel behavior, the system may still write to the device.
For example, Ext3 or ext4 will replay its journal if the
filesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access,
you may want to mount ext3 or ext4 filesystem with
&quot;ro,noload&quot; mount options or set the block device
to read-only mode, see command blockdev(8).</p>

<p>-w, --rw Mount the filesystem read/write. This is the
default. A synonym is -o rw.</p>

<p>-L label Mount the partition that has the specified
label.</p>

<p>-U uuid Mount the partition that has the specified uuid.
These two options require the file /proc/partitions (present
since Linux 2.1.116) to exist.</p>

<p>-t, --types vfstype The argument following the -t is
used to indicate the filesystem type. The filesystem types
which are currently supported include: adfs, affs, autofs,
cifs, coda, coherent, cramfs, debugfs, devpts, efs, ext,
ext2, ext3, ext4, hfs, hfsplus, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix,
msdos, ncpfs, nfs, nfs4, ntfs, proc, qnx4, ramfs, reiserfs,
romfs, squashfs, smbfs, sysv, tmpfs, ubifs, udf, ufs,
umsdos, usbfs, vfat, xenix, xfs, xiafs. Note that coherent,
sysv and xenix are equivalent and that xenix and coherent
will be removed at some point in the future use sysv
instead. Since kernel version 2.1.21 the types ext and xiafs
do not exist anymore. Earlier, usbfs was known as usbdevfs.
Note, the real list of all supported filesystems depends on
your ker- nel.</p>

<p>For most types all the mount program has to do is issue
a simple mount(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of
the filesys- tem type is required. For a few types however
(like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) ad hoc code is
necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems
have a separate mount pro- gram. In order to make it
possible to treat all types in a uni- form way, mount will
execute the program /sbin/mount.TYPE (if that exists) when
called with type TYPE. Since various versions of the
smbmount program have different calling conventions,
/sbin/mount.smbfs may have to be a shell script that sets up
the desired call.</p>

<p>If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
specified, mount will try to guess the desired type. Mount
uses the blkid or volume_id library for guessing the
filesystem type; if that does not turn up anything that
looks familiar, mount will try to read the file
/etc/filesystems, or, if that does not exist,
/proc/filesystems. All of the filesystem types listed there
will be tried, except for those that are labeled
&quot;nodev&quot; (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If
/etc/filesystems ends in a line with a single * only, mount
will read /proc/filesystems afterwards.</p>

<p>The auto type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
Creating a file /etc/filesystems can be useful to change the
probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before
ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader. Warning: the
probing uses a heuristic (the presence of appropriate
magic), and could rec- ognize the wrong filesystem type,
possibly with catastrophic consequences. If your data is
valuable, dont ask mount to guess.</p>

<p>More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
list. The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with no
to specify the filesystem types on which no action should be
taken. (This can be meaningful with the -a option.) For
example, the command:</p>

<p>mount -a -t nomsdos,ext</p>

<p>mounts all filesystems except those of type msdos and
ext.</p>

<p>-O, --test-opts opts Used in conjunction with -a, to
limit the set of filesystems to which the -a is applied.
Like -t in this regard except that it is useless except in
the context of -a. For example, the com- mand:</p>

<p>mount -a -O no_netdev</p>

<p>mounts all filesystems except those which have the
option _net- dev specified in the options field in the
/etc/fstab file.</p>

<p>It is different from -t in that each option is matched
exactly; a leading no at the beginning of one option does
not negate the rest.</p>

<p>The -t and -O options are cumulative in effect; that is,
the command</p>

<p>mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev</p>

<p>mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not
all filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev
option specified.</p>

<p>-o, --options opts Options are specified with a -o flag
followed by a comma sepa- rated string of options. For
example:</p>

<p>mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nouser</p>

<p>For more details, see FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT
OPTIONS and FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS sections.</p>

<p>-B, --bind Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its
contents are available in both places). See above.</p>

<p>-R, --rbind Remount a subtree and all possible submounts
somewhere else (so that its contents are available in both
places). See above.</p>

<p>-M, --move Move a subtree to some other place. See
above.</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS Some of these
options are only useful when they appear in the /etc/fstab
file.</p>

<p>Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by
default in the system kernel. To check the current setting
see the options in /proc/mounts.</p>

<p>The following options apply to any filesystem that is
being mounted (but not every filesystem actually honors them
- e.g., the sync option today has effect only for ext2,
ext3, fat, vfat and ufs):</p>

<p>async All I/O to the filesystem should be done
asynchronously. (See also the sync option.)</p>

<p>atime Update inode access time for each access. See also
the stricta- time mount option.</p>

<p>noatime Do not update inode access times on this
filesystem (e.g, for faster access on the news spool to
speed up news servers).</p>

<p>auto Can be mounted with the -a option.</p>

<p>noauto Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a
option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).</p>

<p>context=context, fscontext=context, defcontext=context
and rootcon- text=context The context= option is useful when
mounting filesystems that do not support extended
attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with
VFAT, or systems that are not normally running under
SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted disk from a non-SELinux
workstation. You can also use context= on filesystems you do
not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility
with xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier 2.4.&lt;x&gt;
kernel versions. Even where xattrs are supported, you can
save time not having to label every file by assigning the
entire disk one security con- text.</p>

<p>A commonly used option for removable media is
context=sys- tem_u:object_r:removable_t.</p>

<p>Two other options are fscontext= and defcontext=, both
of which are mutually exclusive of the context option. This
means you can use fscontext and defcontext with each other,
but neither can be used with context.</p>

<p>The fscontext= option works for all filesystems,
regardless of their xattr support. The fscontext option sets
the overarching filesystem label to a specific security
context. This filesystem label is separate from the
individual labels on the files. It represents the entire
filesystem for certain kinds of permission checks, such as
during mount or file creation. Individual file labels are
still obtained from the xattrs on the files them- selves.
The context option actually sets the aggregate context that
fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label
for individual files.</p>

<p>You can set the default security context for unlabeled
files using defcontext= option. This overrides the value set
for unla- beled files in the policy and requires a
filesystem that sup- ports xattr labeling.</p>

<p>The rootcontext= option allows you to explicitly label
the root inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode
because visable to userspace. This was found to be useful
for things like stateless linux.</p>

<p>For more details, see selinux(8)</p>

<p>defaults Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto,
nouser, and async.</p>

<p>dev Interpret character or block special devices on the
filesystem.</p>

<p>nodev Do not interpret character or block special
devices on the file system.</p>

<p>diratime Update directory inode access times on this
filesystem. This is the default.</p>

<p>nodiratime Do not update directory inode access times on
this filesystem.</p>

<p>dirsync All directory updates within the filesystem
should be done syn- chronously. This affects the following
system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir,
mknod and rename.</p>

<p>exec Permit execution of binaries.</p>

<p>noexec Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on
the mounted filesystem. (Until recently it was possible to
run binaries anyway using a command like /lib/ld*.so
/mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 /
2.6.0.)</p>

<p>group Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the filesystem if one of his groups matches the group of the
device. This option implies the options nosuid and nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option
line group,dev,suid).</p>

<p>iversion Every time the inode is modified, the i_version
field will be incremented.</p>

<p>noiversion Do not increment the i_version inode
field.</p>

<p>mand Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See
fcntl(2).</p>

<p>nomand Do not allow mandatory locks on this
filesystem.</p>

<p>_netdev The filesystem resides on a device that requires
network access (used to prevent the system from attempting
to mount these filesystems until the network has been
enabled on the system).</p>

<p>nofail Do not report errors for this device if it does
not exist.</p>

<p>relatime Update inode access times relative to modify or
change time. Access time is only updated if the previous
access time was ear- lier than the current modify or change
time. (Similar to noat- ime, but doesnt break mutt or other
applications that need to know if a file has been read since
the last time it was modi- fied.)</p>

<p>norelatime Do not use relatime feature. See also the
strictatime mount option.</p>

<p>strictatime Allows to explicitly requesting full atime
updates. This makes it possible for kernel to defaults to
relatime or noatime but still allow userspace to override
it. For more details about the default system mount options
see /proc/mounts.</p>

<p>nostrictatime Use the kernels default behaviour for
inode access time updates.</p>

<p>suid Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
bits to take effect.</p>

<p>nosuid Do not allow set-user-identifier or
set-group-identifier bits to take effect. (This seems safe,
but is in fact rather unsafe if you have suidperl(1)
installed.)</p>

<p>owner Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the filesystem if he is the owner of the device. This option
implies the options nosuid and nodev (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
owner,dev,suid).</p>

<p>remount Attempt to remount an already-mounted
filesystem. This is com- monly used to change the mount
flags for a filesystem, espe- cially to make a readonly
filesystem writeable. It does not change device or mount
point.</p>

<p>The remount functionality follows the standard way how
the mount command works with options from fstab. It means
the mount com- mand doesnt read fstab (or mtab) only when a
device and dir are fully specified.</p>

<p>mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir</p>

<p>After this call all old mount options are replaced and
arbitrary stuff from fstab is ignored, except the loop=
option which is internally generated and maintained by the
mount command.</p>

<p>mount -o remount,rw /dir</p>

<p>After this call mount reads fstab (or mtab) and merges
these options with options from command line ( -o ).</p>

<p>ro Mount the filesystem read-only.</p>

<p>rw Mount the filesystem read-write.</p>

<p>sync All I/O to the filesystem should be done
synchronously. In case of media with limited number of write
cycles (e.g. some flash drives) &quot;sync&quot; may cause
life-cycle shortening.</p>

<p>user Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. The
name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that he can
unmount the filesystem again. This option implies the
options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
user,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p>nouser Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the filesys- tem. This is the default.</p>

<p>users Allow every user to mount and unmount the
filesystem. This option implies the options noexec, nosuid,
and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options, as in
the option line users,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS The following options
apply only to certain filesystems. We sort them by
filesystem. They all follow the -o flag.</p>

<p>What options are supported depends a bit on the running
kernel. More info may be found in the kernel source
subdirectory Documenta- tion/filesystems.</p>

<p>Mount options for adfs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of the files in the filesystem (default:
uid=gid=0).</p>

<p>ownmask=value and othmask=value Set the permission mask
for ADFS owner permissions and other permissions,
respectively (default: 0700 and 0077, respec- tively). See
also /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesys-
tems/adfs.txt.</p>

<p>Mount options for affs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of the root of the filesystem (default:
uid=gid=0, but with option uid or gid without specified
value, the uid and gid of the current process are
taken).</p>

<p>setuid=value and setgid=value Set the owner and group of
all files.</p>

<p>mode=value Set the mode of all files to value &amp; 0777
disregarding the orig- inal permissions. Add search
permission to directories that have read permission. The
value is given in octal.</p>

<p>protect Do not allow any changes to the protection bits
on the filesys- tem.</p>

<p>usemp Set uid and gid of the root of the filesystem to
the uid and gid of the mount point upon the first sync or
umount, and then clear this option. Strange...</p>

<p>verbose Print an informational message for each
successful mount.</p>

<p>prefix=string Prefix used before volume name, when
following a link.</p>

<p>volume=string Prefix (of length at most 30) used before
/ when following a symbolic link.</p>

<p>reserved=value (Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at
the start of the device.</p>

<p>root=value Give explicitly the location of the root
block.</p>

<p>bs=value Give blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024,
2048, 4096.</p>

<p>grpquota|noquota|quota|usrquota These options are
accepted but ignored. (However, quota utili- ties may react
to such strings in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p>Mount options for cifs See the options section of the
mount.cifs(8) man page (samba-client package must be
installed).</p>

<p>Mount options for coherent None.</p>

<p>Mount options for debugfs The debugfs filesystem is a
pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on
/sys/kernel/debug. There are no mount options.</p>

<p>Mount options for devpts The devpts filesystem is a
pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In
order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens
/dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made
available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can
be accessed as /dev/pts/&lt;number&gt;.</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value This sets the owner or the group
of newly created PTYs to the specified values. When nothing
is specified, they will be set to the UID and GID of the
creating process. For example, if there is a tty group with
GID 5, then gid=5 will cause newly created PTYs to belong to
the tty group.</p>

<p>mode=value Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the
specified value. The default is 0600. A value of mode=620
and gid=5 makes &quot;mesg y&quot; the default on newly
created PTYs.</p>

<p>newinstance Create a private instance of devpts
filesystem, such that indices of ptys allocated in this new
instance are independent of indices created in other
instances of devpts.</p>

<p>All mounts of devpts without this newinstance option
share the same set of pty indices (i.e legacy mode). Each
mount of devpts with the newinstance option has a private
set of pty indices.</p>

<p>This option is mainly used to support containers in the
linux kernel. It is implemented in linux kernel versions
starting with 2.6.29. Further, this mount option is valid
only if CON- FIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the
kernel configu- ration.</p>

<p>To use this option effectively, /dev/ptmx must be a
symbolic link to pts/ptmx. See
Documentation/filesystems/devpts.txt in the linux kernel
source tree for details.</p>

<p>ptmxmode=value</p>

<p>Set the mode for the new ptmx device node in the devpts
filesys- tem.</p>

<p>With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see
newin- stance option above), each instance has a private
ptmx node in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically
/dev/pts/ptmx).</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the
default mode of the new ptmx node is 0000. ptmxmode=value
specifies a more useful mode for the ptmx node and is highly
recommended when the newinstance option is specified.</p>

<p>This option is only implemented in linux kernel versions
start- ing with 2.6.29. Further this option is valid only if
CON- FIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the kernel
configu- ration.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext None. Note that the ext filesystem
is obsolete. Dont use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21 extfs
is no longer part of the kernel source.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext2 The ext2 filesystem is the
standard Linux filesystem. Since Linux 2.5.46, for most
mount options the default is determined by the filesystem
superblock. Set them with tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>acl|noacl Support POSIX Access Control Lists (or
not).</p>

<p>bsddf|minixdf Set the behaviour for the statfs system
call. The minixdf behaviour is to return in the f_blocks
field the total number of blocks of the filesystem, while
the bsddf behaviour (which is the default) is to subtract
the overhead blocks used by the ext2 filesystem and not
available for file storage. Thus</p>

<p>% mount /k -o minixdf; df /k; umount /k Filesystem
1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on /dev/sda6
2630655 86954 2412169 3% /k % mount /k -o bsddf; df /k;
umount /k Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity
Mounted on /dev/sda6 2543714 13 2412169 0% /k</p>

<p>(Note that this example shows that one can add command
line options to the options given in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p>check={none|nocheck} No checking is done at mount time.
This is the default. This is fast. It is wise to invoke
e2fsck(8) every now and then, e.g. at boot time.</p>

<p>debug Print debugging info upon each (re)mount.</p>

<p>errors={continue|remount-ro|panic} Define the behaviour
when an error is encountered. (Either ignore errors and just
mark the filesystem erroneous and con- tinue, or remount the
filesystem read-only, or panic and halt the system.) The
default is set in the filesystem superblock, and can be
changed using tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>grpid|bsdgroups and nogrpid|sysvgroups These options
define what group id a newly created file gets. When grpid
is set, it takes the group id of the directory in which it
is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of
the current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
directory itself.</p>

<p>grpquota|noquota|quota|usrquota These options are
accepted but ignored.</p>

<p>nobh Do not attach buffer_heads to file pagecache.
(Since 2.5.49.)</p>

<p>nouid32 Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs. This is for
interoperability with older kernels which only store and
expect 16-bit values.</p>

<p>oldalloc or orlov Use old allocator or Orlov allocator
for new inodes. Orlov is default.</p>

<p>resgid=n and resuid=n The ext2 filesystem reserves a
certain percentage of the avail- able space (by default 5%,
see mke2fs(8) and tune2fs(8)). These options determine who
can use the reserved blocks. (Roughly: whoever has the
specified uid, or belongs to the specified group.)</p>

<p>sb=n Instead of block 1, use block n as superblock. This
could be useful when the filesystem has been damaged.
(Earlier, copies of the superblock would be made every 8192
blocks: in block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands
of copies on a big filesystem). Since version 1.08, mke2fs
has a -s (sparse superblock) option to reduce the number of
backup superblocks, and since version 1.15 this is the
default. Note that this may mean that ext2 filesystems
created by a recent mke2fs cannot be mounted r/w under Linux
2.0.*.) The block number here uses 1k units. Thus, if you
want to use logical block 32768 on a filesystem with 4k
blocks, use &quot;sb=131072&quot;.</p>

<p>user_xattr|nouser_xattr Support &quot;user.&quot;
extended attributes (or not).</p>

<p>Mount options for ext3 The ext3 filesystem is a version
of the ext2 filesystem which has been enhanced with
journalling. It supports the same options as ext2 as well as
the following additions:</p>

<p>journal=update Update the ext3 filesystems journal to
the current format.</p>

<p>journal=inum When a journal already exists, this option
is ignored. Other- wise, it specifies the number of the
inode which will represent the ext3 filesystems journal
file; ext3 will create a new journal, overwriting the old
contents of the file whose inode number is inum.</p>

<p>noload Do not load the ext3 filesystem s journal on
mounting.</p>

<p>data={journal|ordered|writeback} Specifies the
journalling mode for file data. Metadata is always
journaled. To use modes other than ordered on the root
filesystem, pass the mode to the kernel as boot parameter,
e.g. rootflags=data=journal.</p>

<p>journal All data is committed into the journal prior to
being written into the main filesystem.</p>

<p>ordered This is the default mode. All data is forced
directly out to the main file system prior to its metadata
being committed to the journal.</p>

<p>writeback Data ordering is not preserved - data may be
written into the main filesystem after its metadata has been
committed to the journal. This is rumoured to be the
highest- throughput option. It guarantees internal
filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data to
appear in files after a crash and journal recovery.</p>

<p>barrier=0 / barrier=1 This enables/disables barriers.
barrier=0 disables it, bar- rier=1 enables it. Write
barriers enforce proper on-disk order- ing of journal
commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to use, at
some performance penalty. The ext3 filesystem does not
enable write barriers by default. Be sure to enable barri-
ers unless your disks are battery-backed one way or another.
Otherwise you risk filesystem corruption in case of power
fail- ure.</p>

<p>commit=nrsec Sync all data and metadata every nrsec
seconds. The default value is 5 seconds. Zero means
default.</p>

<p>user_xattr Enable Extended User Attributes. See the
attr(5) manual page.</p>

<p>acl Enable POSIX Access Control Lists. See the acl(5)
manual page.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext4 The ext4 filesystem is an an
advanced level of the ext3 filesystem which incorporates
scalability and reliability enhancements for sup- porting
large filesystem.</p>

<p>The options journal_dev, noload, data, commit, orlov,
oldalloc, [no]user_xattr [no]acl, bsddf, minixdf, debug,
errors, data_err, grpid, bsdgroups, nogrpid sysvgroups,
resgid, resuid, sb, quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota and
[no]bh are backwardly compatible with ext3 or ext2.</p>

<p>journal_checksum Enable checksumming of the journal
transactions. This will allow the recovery code in e2fsck
and the kernel to detect cor- ruption in the kernel. It is a
compatible change and will be ignored by older kernels.</p>

<p>journal_async_commit Commit block can be written to disk
without waiting for descrip- tor blocks. If enabled older
kernels cannot mount the device. This will enable</p>

<p>journal=update Update the ext4 filesystems journal to
the current format.</p>

<p>barrier=0 / barrier=1 / barrier / nobarrier This
enables/disables the use of write barriers in the jbd code.
barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables. This also requires an
IO stack which can support barriers, and if jbd gets an
error on a barrier write, it will disable again with a
warning. Write bar- riers enforce proper on-disk ordering of
journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to
use, at some performance penalty. If your disks are
battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers may
safely improve performance. The mount options
&quot;barrier&quot; and &quot;nobarrier&quot; can also be
used to enable or disable barriers, for consistency with
other ext4 mount options.</p>

<p>The ext4 filesystem enables write barriers by
default.</p>

<p>inode_readahead=n This tuning parameter controls the
maximum number of inode table blocks that ext4s inode table
readahead algorithm will pre-read into the buffer cache. The
default value is 32 blocks.</p>

<p>stripe=n Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will
try to use for allocation size and alignment. For RAID5/6
systems this should be the number of data disks * RAID chunk
size in filesystem blocks.</p>

<p>delalloc Deferring block allocation until write-out
time.</p>

<p>nodelalloc Disable delayed allocation. Blocks are
allocation when data is copied from user to page cache.</p>

<p>max_batch_time=usec Maximum amount of time ext4 should
wait for additional filesys- tem operations to be batch
together with a synchronous write operation. Since a
synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and
then a wait for the I/O complete, it doesnt cost much, and
can be a huge throughput win, we wait for a small amount of
time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the
synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to auto-
matically tune for the speed of the disk, by measuring the
amount of time (on average) that it takes to finish
committing a transaction. Call this time the &quot;commit
time&quot;. If the time that the transactoin has been
running is less than the commit time, ext4 will try sleeping
for the commit time to see if other oper- ations will join
the transaction. The commit time is capped by the
max_batch_time, which defaults to 15000us (15ms). This opti-
mization can be turned off entirely by setting
max_batch_time to 0.</p>

<p>min_batch_time=usec This parameter sets the commit time
(as described above) to be at least min_batch_time. It
defaults to zero microseconds. Increasing this parameter may
improve the throughput of multi- threaded, synchronous
workloads on very fast disks, at the cost of increasing
latency.</p>

<p>journal_ioprio=prio The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where
0 is the highest priorty) which should be used for I/O
operations submitted by kjournald2 during a commit
operation. This defaults to 3, which is a slightly higher
priority than the default I/O priority.</p>

<p>auto_da_alloc|noauto_da_alloc Many broken applications
don t use fsync() when noauto_da_alloc replacing existing
files via patterns such as</p>

<p>fd = open(&quot;foo.new&quot;)/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/
rename(&quot;foo.new&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)</p>

<p>or worse yet</p>

<p>fd = open(&quot;foo&quot;,
O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).</p>

<p>If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the
replace-via- rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and
force that any delayed allocation blocks are allocated such
that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk
before the rename() operation is commited. This provides
roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the
&quot;zero-length&quot; problem that can happen when a
system crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are
forced to disk.</p>

<p>Mount options for fat (Note: fat is not a separate
filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat
filesystems.)</p>

<p>blocksize={512|1024|2048} Set blocksize (default 512).
This option is obsolete.</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value Set the owner and group of all
files. (Default: the uid and gid of the current
process.)</p>

<p>umask=value Set the umask (the bitmask of the
permissions that are not present). The default is the umask
of the current process. The value is given in octal.</p>

<p>dmask=value Set the umask applied to directories only.
The default is the umask of the current process. The value
is given in octal.</p>

<p>fmask=value Set the umask applied to regular files only.
The default is the umask of the current process. The value
is given in octal.</p>

<p>allow_utime=value This option controls the permission
check of mtime/atime.</p>

<p>20 If current process is in group of files group ID, you
can change timestamp.</p>

<p>2 Other users can change timestamp.</p>

<p>The default is set from dmask option. (If the directory
is writable, utime(2) is also allowed. I.e. ~dmask &amp;
022)</p>

<p>Normally utime(2) checks current process is owner of the
file, or it has CAP_FOWNER capability. But FAT filesystem
doesnt have uid/gid on disk, so normal check is too
unflexible. With this option you can relax it.</p>

<p>check=value Three different levels of pickyness can be
chosen:</p>

<p>r[elaxed] Upper and lower case are accepted and
equivalent, long name parts are truncated (e.g.
verylongname.foobar becomes verylong.foo), leading and
embedded spaces are accepted in each name part (name and
extension).</p>

<p>n[ormal] Like &quot;relaxed&quot;, but many special
characters (*, ?, &lt;, spaces, etc.) are rejected. This is
the default.</p>

<p>s[trict] Like &quot;normal&quot;, but names may not
contain long parts and special characters that are sometimes
used on Linux, but are not accepted by MS-DOS are rejected.
(+, =, spaces, etc.)</p>

<p>codepage=value Sets the codepage for converting to
shortname characters on FAT and VFAT filesystems. By
default, codepage 437 is used.</p>

<p>conv={b[inary]|t[ext]|a[uto]} The fat filesystem can
perform CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL (MS-DOS text format to UNIX text
format) conversion in the kernel. The following con- version
modes are available:</p>

<p>binary no translation is performed. This is the
default.</p>

<p>text CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all
files.</p>

<p>auto CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all
files that don t have a &quot;well-known binary&quot;
extension. The list of known extensions can be found at the
beginning of fs/fat/misc.c (as of 2.0, the list is: exe,
com, bin, app, sys, drv, ovl, ovr, obj, lib, dll, pif, arc,
zip, lha, lzh, zoo, tar, z, arj, tz, taz, tzp, tpz, gz, tgz,
deb, gif, bmp, tif, gl, jpg, pcx, tfm, vf, gf, pk, pxl,
dvi).</p>

<p>Programs that do computed lseeks won t like in-kernel
text con- version. Several people have had their data ruined
by this translation. Beware!</p>

<p>For filesystems mounted in binary mode, a conversion
tool (from- dos/todos) is available. This option is
obsolete.</p>

<p>cvf_format=module Forces the driver to use the CVF
(Compressed Volume File) module cvf_module instead of
auto-detection. If the kernel supports kmod, the
cvf_format=xxx option also controls on-demand CVF mod- ule
loading. This option is obsolete.</p>

<p>cvf_option=option Option passed to the CVF module. This
option is obsolete.</p>

<p>debug Turn on the debug flag. A version string and a
list of filesys- tem parameters will be printed (these data
are also printed if the parameters appear to be
inconsistent).</p>

<p>fat={12|16|32} Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat. This
overrides the automatic FAT type detection routine. Use with
caution!</p>

<p>iocharset=value Character set to use for converting
between 8 bit characters and 16 bit Unicode characters. The
default is iso8859-1. Long file- names are stored on disk in
Unicode format.</p>

<p>tz=UTC This option disables the conversion of timestamps
between local time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC
(which Linux uses internally). This is particularly useful
when mounting devices (like digital cameras) that are set to
UTC in order to avoid the pitfalls of local time.</p>

<p>quiet Turn on the quiet flag. Attempts to chown or chmod
files do not return errors, although they fail. Use with
caution!</p>

<p>showexec If set, the execute permission bits of the file
will be allowed only if the extension part of the name is
.EXE, .COM, or .BAT. Not set by default.</p>

<p>sys_immutable If set, ATTR_SYS attribute on FAT is
handled as IMMUTABLE flag on Linux. Not set by default.</p>

<p>flush If set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk
more early than normal. Not set by default.</p>

<p>usefree Use the &quot;free clusters&quot; value stored
on FSINFO. It ll be used to determine number of free
clusters without scanning disk. But its not used by default,
because recent Windows don t update it correctly in some
case. If you are sure the &quot;free clusters&quot; on
FSINFO is correct, by this option you can avoid scanning
disk.</p>

<p>dots, nodots, dotsOK=[yes|no] Various misguided attempts
to force Unix or DOS conventions onto a FAT filesystem.</p>

<p>Mount options for hfs creator=cccc, type=cccc Set the
creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder used for
creating new files. Default values: ????.</p>

<p>uid=n, gid=n Set the owner and group of all files.
(Default: the uid and gid of the current process.)</p>

<p>dir_umask=n, file_umask=n, umask=n Set the umask used
for all directories, all regular files, or all files and
directories. Defaults to the umask of the current
process.</p>

<p>session=n Select the CDROM session to mount. Defaults to
leaving that decision to the CDROM driver. This option will
fail with any- thing but a CDROM as underlying device.</p>

<p>part=n Select partition number n from the device. Only
makes sense for CDROMS. Defaults to not parsing the
partition table at all.</p>

<p>quiet Dont complain about invalid mount options.</p>

<p>Mount options for hpfs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of all files. (Default: the uid and gid of
the current process.)</p>

<p>umask=value Set the umask (the bitmask of the
permissions that are not present). The default is the umask
of the current process. The value is given in octal.</p>

<p>case={lower|asis} Convert all files names to lower case,
or leave them. (Default: case=lower.)</p>

<p>conv={binary|text|auto} For conv=text, delete some
random CRs (in particular, all fol- lowed by NL) when
reading a file. For conv=auto, choose more or less at random
between conv=binary and conv=text. For conv=binary, just
read what is in the file. This is the default.</p>

<p>nocheck Do not abort mounting when certain consistency
checks fail.</p>

<p>Mount options for iso9660 ISO 9660 is a standard
describing a filesystem structure to be used on CD-ROMs.
(This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs. See also
the udf filesystem.)</p>

<p>Normal iso9660 filenames appear in a 8.3 format (i.e.,
DOS-like restrictions on filename length), and in addition
all characters are in upper case. Also there is no field for
file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for
block/character devices, etc.</p>

<p>Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all
of these unix like features. Basically there are extensions
to each directory record that supply all of the additional
information, and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem
is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesys- tem (except
that it is read-only, of course).</p>

<p>norock Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if
available. Cf. map.</p>

<p>nojoliet Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions,
even if avail- able. Cf. map.</p>

<p>check={r[elaxed]|s[trict]} With check=relaxed, a
filename is first converted to lower case before doing the
lookup. This is probably only meaningful together with
norock and map=normal. (Default: check=strict.)</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value Give all files in the filesystem
the indicated user or group id, possibly overriding the
information found in the Rock Ridge extensions. (Default:
uid=0,gid=0.)</p>

<p>map={n[ormal]|o[ff]|a[corn]} For non-Rock Ridge volumes,
normal name translation maps upper to lower case ASCII,
drops a trailing ;1 , and converts ; to . . With map=off no
name translation is done. See norock. (Default: map=normal.)
map=acorn is like map=normal but also apply Acorn extensions
if present.</p>

<p>mode=value For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files
the indicated mode. (Default: read permission for
everybody.) Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs to
specify the mode in decimal. (Octal is indicated by a
leading 0.)</p>

<p>unhide Also show hidden and associated files. (If the
ordinary files and the associated or hidden files have the
same filenames, this may make the ordinary files
inaccessible.)</p>

<p>block={512|1024|2048} Set the block size to the
indicated value. (Default: block=1024.)</p>

<p>conv={a[uto]|b[inary]|m[text]|t[ext]} (Default:
conv=binary.) Since Linux 1.3.54 this option has no effect
anymore. (And non-binary settings used to be very dan-
gerous, possibly leading to silent data corruption.)</p>

<p>cruft If the high byte of the file length contains other
garbage, set this mount option to ignore the high order bits
of the file length. This implies that a file cannot be
larger than 16MB.</p>

<p>session=x Select number of session on multisession CD.
(Since 2.3.4.)</p>

<p>sbsector=xxx Session begins from sector xxx. (Since
2.3.4.)</p>

<p>The following options are the same as for vfat and
specifying them only makes sense when using discs encoded
using Microsofts Joliet exten- sions.</p>

<p>iocharset=value Character set to use for converting 16
bit Unicode characters on CD to 8 bit characters. The
default is iso8859-1.</p>

<p>utf8 Convert 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to
UTF-8.</p>

<p>Mount options for jfs iocharset=name Character set to
use for converting from Unicode to ASCII. The default is to
do no conversion. Use iocharset=utf8 for UTF8 translations.
This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 to be set in the kernel
.config file.</p>

<p>resize=value Resize the volume to value blocks. JFS only
supports growing a volume, not shrinking it. This option is
only valid during a remount, when the volume is mounted
read-write. The resize key- word with no value will grow the
volume to the full size of the partition.</p>

<p>nointegrity Do not write to the journal. The primary use
of this option is to allow for higher performance when
restoring a volume from backup media. The integrity of the
volume is not guaranteed if the system abnormally
abends.</p>

<p>integrity Default. Commit metadata changes to the
journal. Use this option to remount a volume where the
nointegrity option was pre- viously specified in order to
restore normal behavior.</p>

<p>errors={continue|remount-ro|panic} Define the behaviour
when an error is encountered. (Either ignore errors and just
mark the filesystem erroneous and con- tinue, or remount the
filesystem read-only, or panic and halt the system.)</p>

<p>noquota|quota|usrquota|grpquota These options are
accepted but ignored.</p>

<p>Mount options for minix None.</p>

<p>Mount options for msdos See mount options for fat. If
the msdos filesystem detects an incon- sistency, it reports
an error and sets the file system read-only. The filesystem
can be made writeable again by remounting it.</p>

<p>Mount options for ncpfs Just like nfs, the ncpfs
implementation expects a binary argument (a struct
ncp_mount_data) to the mount system call. This argument is
con- structed by ncpmount(8) and the current version of
mount (2.12) does not know anything about ncpfs.</p>

<p>Mount options for nfs and nfs4 See the options section
of the nfs(5) man page (nfs-utils package must be
installed).</p>

<p>The nfs and nfs4 implementation expects a binary
argument (a struct nfs_mount_data) to the mount system call.
This argument is constructed by mount.nfs(8) and the current
version of mount (2.13) does not know anything about nfs and
nfs4.</p>

<p>Mount options for ntfs iocharset=name Character set to
use when returning file names. Unlike VFAT, NTFS suppresses
names that contain unconvertible characters. Deprecated.</p>

<p>nls=name New name for the option earlier called
iocharset.</p>

<p>utf8 Use UTF-8 for converting file names.</p>

<p>uni_xlate={0|1|2} For 0 (or no or false ), do not use
escape sequences for unknown Unicode characters. For 1 (or
yes or true) or 2, use vfat-style 4-byte escape sequences
starting with &quot;:&quot;. Here 2 give a little-endian
encoding and 1 a byteswapped bigendian encoding.</p>

<p>posix=[0|1] If enabled (posix=1), the filesystem
distinguishes between upper and lower case. The 8.3 alias
names are presented as hard links instead of being
suppressed. This option is obsolete.</p>

<p>uid=value, gid=value and umask=value Set the file
permission on the filesystem. The umask value is given in
octal. By default, the files are owned by root and not
readable by somebody else.</p>

<p>Mount options for proc uid=value and gid=value These
options are recognized, but have no effect as far as I can
see.</p>

<p>Mount options for ramfs Ramfs is a memory based
filesystem. Mount it and you have it. Unmount it and it is
gone. Present since Linux 2.3.99pre4. There are no mount
options.</p>

<p>Mount options for reiserfs Reiserfs is a journaling
filesystem.</p>

<p>conv Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a
version 3.5 filesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly
created objects. This filesystem will no longer be
compatible with reiserfs 3.5 tools.</p>

<p>hash={rupasov|tea|r5|detect} Choose which hash function
reiserfs will use to find files within directories.</p>

<p>rupasov A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov. It is fast
and pre- serves locality, mapping lexicographically close
file names to close hash values. This option should not be
used, as it causes a high probability of hash
collisions.</p>

<p>tea A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy
Fitzhardinge. It uses hash permuting bits in the name. It
gets high randomness and, therefore, low probability of hash
collisions at some CPU cost. This may be used if
EHASHCOLLISION errors are experienced with the r5 hash.</p>

<p>r5 A modified version of the rupasov hash. It is used by
default and is the best choice unless the filesystem has
huge directories and unusual file-name patterns.</p>

<p>detect Instructs mount to detect which hash function is
in use by examining the filesystem being mounted, and to
write this information into the reiserfs superblock. This is
only useful on the first mount of an old format filesys-
tem.</p>

<p>hashed_relocation Tunes the block allocator. This may
provide performance improve- ments in some situations.</p>

<p>no_unhashed_relocation Tunes the block allocator. This
may provide performance improve- ments in some
situations.</p>

<p>noborder Disable the border allocator algorithm invented
by Yury Yu. Rupasov. This may provide performance
improvements in some sit- uations.</p>

<p>nolog Disable journalling. This will provide slight
performance improvements in some situations at the cost of
losing reiserfss fast recovery from crashes. Even with this
option turned on, reiserfs still performs all journalling
operations, save for actual writes into its journalling
area. Implementation of nolog is a work in progress.</p>

<p>notail By default, reiserfs stores small files and file
tails directly into its tree. This confuses some utilities
such as LILO(8). This option is used to disable packing of
files into the tree.</p>

<p>replayonly Replay the transactions which are in the
journal, but do not actually mount the filesystem. Mainly
used by reiserfsck.</p>

<p>resize=number A remount option which permits online
expansion of reiserfs par- titions. Instructs reiserfs to
assume that the device has num- ber blocks. This option is
designed for use with devices which are under logical volume
management (LVM). There is a special resizer utility which

<p>user_xattr Enable Extended User Attributes. See the
attr(5) manual page.</p>

<p>acl Enable POSIX Access Control Lists. See the acl(5)
manual page.</p>

<p>barrier=none / barrier=flush This enables/disables the
use of write barriers in the journal- ing code. barrier=none
disables it, barrier=flush enables it. Write barriers
enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal com- mits, making
volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance
penalty. The reiserfs filesystem does not enable write
barriers by default. Be sure to enable barriers unless your
disks are battery-backed one way or another. Otherwise you
risk filesystem corruption in case of power failure.</p>

<p>Mount options for romfs None.</p>

<p>Mount options for squashfs None.</p>

<p>Mount options for smbfs Just like nfs, the smbfs
implementation expects a binary argument (a struct
smb_mount_data) to the mount system call. This argument is
con- structed by smbmount(8) and the current version of
mount (2.12) does not know anything about smbfs.</p>

<p>Mount options for sysv None.</p>

<p>Mount options for tmpfs size=nbytes Override default
maximum size of the filesystem. The size is given in bytes,
and rounded up to entire pages. The default is half of the
memory. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit
this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM:
the default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified,
is size=50%</p>

<p>nr_blocks= The same as size, but in blocks of
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE</p>

<p>nr_inodes= The maximum number of inodes for this
instance. The default is half of the number of your physical
RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of
lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.</p>

<p>The tmpfs mount options for sizing ( size, nr_blocks,
and nr_inodes) accept a suffix k, m or g for Ki, Mi, Gi
(binary kilo, mega and giga) and can be changed on
remount.</p>

<p>mode= Set initial permissions of the root directory.</p>

<p>uid= The user id.</p>

<p>gid= The group id.</p>


<p>mpol=[default|prefer:Node|bind:NodeList|interleave|interleave:NodeList]
Set the NUMA memory allocation policy for all files in that
instance (if the kernel CONFIG_NUMA is enabled) - which can
be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount ...</p>

<p>default prefers to allocate memory from the local
node</p>

<p>prefer:Node prefers to allocate memory from the given
Node</p>

<p>bind:NodeList allocates memory only from nodes in
NodeList</p>

<p>interleave prefers to allocate from each node in
turn</p>

<p>interleave:NodeList allocates from each node of NodeList
in turn.</p>

<p>The NodeList format is a comma-separated list of decimal
numbers and ranges, a range being two hyphen-separated
decimal numbers, the smallest and largest node numbers in
the range. For exam- ple, mpol=bind:0-3,5,7,9-15</p>

<p>Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option
will fail if the running kernel does not support NUMA; and
will fail if its nodelist specifies a node which is not
online. If your sys- tem relies on that tmpfs being mounted,
but from time to time runs a kernel built without NUMA
capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or with fewer
nodes online, then it is advis- able to omit the mpol option
from automatic mount options. It can be added later, when
the tmpfs is already mounted on Mount- Point, by mount -o
remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint.</p>

<p>Mount options for ubifs UBIFS is a flash file system
which works on top of UBI volumes. Note that atime is not
supported and is always turned off.</p>

<p>The device name may be specified as ubiX_Y UBI device
number X, volume number Y</p>

<p>ubiY UBI device number 0, volume number Y</p>

<p>ubiX:NAME UBI device number X, volume with name NAME</p>

<p>ubi:NAME UBI device number 0, volume with name NAME
Alternative ! separator may be used instead of :.</p>

<p>The following mount options are available:</p>

<p>bulk_read Enable bulk-read. VFS read-ahead is disabled
because it slows down the file system. Bulk-Read is an
internal optimization. Some flashes may read faster if the
data are read at one go, rather than at several read
requests. For example, OneNAND can do
&quot;read-while-load&quot; if it reads more than one NAND
page.</p>

<p>no_bulk_read Do not bulk-read. This is the default.</p>

<p>chk_data_crc Check data CRC-32 checksums. This is the
default.</p>

<p>no_chk_data_crc. Do not check data CRC-32 checksums.
With this option, the filesystem does not check CRC-32
checksum for data, but it does check it for the internal
indexing information. This option only affects reading, not
writing. CRC-32 is always calculated when writing the
data.</p>

<p>compr={none|lzo|zlib} Select the default compressor
which is used when new files are written. It is still
possible to read compressed files if mounted with the none
option.</p>

<p>Mount options for udf udf is the &quot;Universal Disk
Format&quot; filesystem defined by the Optical Storage
Technology Association, and is often used for DVD-ROM. See
also iso9660.</p>

<p>gid= Set the default group.</p>

<p>umask= Set the default umask. The value is given in
octal.</p>

<p>uid= Set the default user.</p>

<p>unhide Show otherwise hidden files.</p>

<p>undelete Show deleted files in lists.</p>

<p>nostrict Unset strict conformance.</p>

<p>iocharset Set the NLS character set.</p>

<p>bs= Set the block size. (May not work unless 2048.)</p>

<p>novrs Skip volume sequence recognition.</p>

<p>session= Set the CDROM session counting from 0. Default:
last session.</p>

<p>anchor= Override standard anchor location. Default:
256.</p>

<p>volume= Override the VolumeDesc location. (unused)</p>

<p>partition= Override the PartitionDesc location.
(unused)</p>

<p>lastblock= Set the last block of the filesystem.</p>

<p>fileset= Override the fileset block location.
(unused)</p>

<p>rootdir= Override the root directory location.
(unused)</p>

<p>Mount options for ufs ufstype=value UFS is a filesystem
widely used in different operating systems. The problem are
differences among implementations. Features of some
implementations are undocumented, so its hard to recognize
the type of ufs automatically. Thats why the user must
specify the type of ufs by mount option. Possible values
are:</p>

<p>old Old format of ufs, this is the default, read only.
(Dont forget to give the -r option.)</p>

<p>44bsd For filesystems created by a BSD-like system
(NetBSD,FreeBSD,OpenBSD).</p>

<p>sun For filesystems created by SunOS or Solaris on
Sparc.</p>

<p>sunx86 For filesystems created by Solaris on x86.</p>

<p>hp For filesystems created by HP-UX, read-only.</p>

<p>nextstep For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT
station) (currently read only).</p>

<p>nextstep-cd For NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048),
read-only.</p>

<p>openstep For filesystems created by OpenStep (currently
read only). The same filesystem type is also used by Mac OS
X.</p>

<p>onerror=value Set behaviour on error:</p>

<p>panic If an error is encountered, cause a kernel
panic.</p>

<p>[lock|umount|repair] These mount options don t do
anything at present; when an error is encountered only a
console message is printed.</p>

<p>Mount options for umsdos See mount options for msdos.
The dotsOK option is explicitly killed by umsdos.</p>

<p>Mount options for vfat First of all, the mount options
for fat are recognized. The dotsOK option is explicitly
killed by vfat. Furthermore, there are</p>

<p>uni_xlate Translate unhandled Unicode characters to
special escaped sequences. This lets you backup and restore
filenames that are created with any Unicode characters.
Without this option, a ? is used when no translation is
possible. The escape character is : because it is otherwise
illegal on the vfat filesystem. The escape sequence that
gets used, where u is the unicode charac- ter, is: :, (u
&amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f), (u&gt;&gt;12).</p>

<p>posix Allow two files with names that only differ in
case. This option is obsolete.</p>

<p>nonumtail First try to make a short name without
sequence number, before trying name~num.ext.</p>

<p>utf8 UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of
Unicode that is used by the console. It can be be enabled
for the filesystem with this option or disabled with utf8=0,
utf8=no or utf8=false. If uni_xlate gets set, UTF8 gets
disabled.</p>

<p>shortname={lower|win95|winnt|mixed}</p>

<p>Defines the behaviour for creation and display of
filenames which fit into 8.3 characters. If a long name for
a file exists, it will always be preferred display. There
are four modes: :</p>

<p>lower Force the short name to lower case upon display;
store a long name when the short name is not all upper case.
This mode is the default.</p>

<p>win95 Force the short name to upper case upon display;
store a long name when the short name is not all upper
case.</p>

<p>winnt Display the shortname as is; store a long name
when the short name is not all lower case or all upper
case.</p>

<p>mixed Display the short name as is; store a long name
when the short name is not all upper case.</p>

<p>Mount options for usbfs devuid=uid and devgid=gid and
devmode=mode Set the owner and group and mode of the device
files in the usbfs filesystem (default: uid=gid=0,
mode=0644). The mode is given in octal.</p>

<p>busuid=uid and busgid=gid and busmode=mode Set the owner
and group and mode of the bus directories in the usbfs
filesystem (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555). The mode is
given in octal.</p>

<p>listuid=uid and listgid=gid and listmode=mode Set the
owner and group and mode of the file devices (default:
uid=gid=0, mode=0444). The mode is given in octal.</p>

<p>Mount options for xenix None.</p>

<p>Mount options for xfs allocsize=size Sets the buffered
I/O end-of-file preallocation size when doing delayed
allocation writeout (default size is 64KiB). Valid val- ues
for this option are page size (typically 4KiB) through to
1GiB, inclusive, in power-of-2 increments.</p>

<p>attr2|noattr2 The options enable/disable (default is
enabled) an &quot;opportunis- tic&quot; improvement to be
made in the way inline extended attributes are stored
on-disk. When the new form is used for the first time (by
setting or removing extended attributes) the on-disk
superblock feature bit field will be updated to reflect this
format being in use.</p>

<p>barrier Enables the use of block layer write barriers
for writes into the journal and unwritten extent conversion.
This allows for drive level write caching to be enabled, for
devices that sup- port write barriers.</p>

<p>dmapi Enable the DMAPI (Data Management API) event
callouts. Use with the mtpt option.</p>

<p>grpid|bsdgroups and nogrpid|sysvgroups These options
define what group ID a newly created file gets. When grpid
is set, it takes the group ID of the directory in which it
is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of
the current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
directory itself.</p>

<p>ihashsize=value Sets the number of hash buckets
available for hashing the in- memory inodes of the specified
mount point. If a value of zero is used, the value selected
by the default algorithm will be displayed in
/proc/mounts.</p>

<p>ikeep|noikeep When inode clusters are emptied of inodes,
keep them around on the disk (ikeep) - this is the
traditional XFS behaviour and is still the default for now.
Using the noikeep option, inode clusters are returned to the
free space pool.</p>

<p>inode64 Indicates that XFS is allowed to create inodes
at any location in the filesystem, including those which
will result in inode numbers occupying more than 32 bits of
significance. This is provided for backwards compatibility,
but causes problems for backup applications that cannot
handle large inode numbers.</p>

<p>largeio|nolargeio If nolargeio is specified, the optimal
I/O reported in st_blk- size by stat(2) will be as small as
possible to allow user applications to avoid inefficient
read/modify/write I/O. If largeio is specified, a filesystem
that has a swidth specified will return the swidth value (in
bytes) in st_blksize. If the filesystem does not have a
swidth specified but does specify an allocsize then
allocsize (in bytes) will be returned instead. If neither of
these two options are specified, then filesystem will behave
as if nolargeio was specified.</p>

<p>logbufs=value Set the number of in-memory log buffers.
Valid numbers range from 2-8 inclusive. The default value is
8 buffers for filesys- tems with a blocksize of 64KiB, 4
buffers for filesystems with a blocksize of 32KiB, 3 buffers
for filesystems with a blocksize of 16KiB and 2 buffers for
all other configurations. Increasing the number of buffers
may increase performance on some workloads at the cost of
the memory used for the additional log buffers and their
associated control structures.</p>

<p>logbsize=value Set the size of each in-memory log
buffer. Size may be speci- fied in bytes, or in kilobytes
with a &quot;k&quot; suffix. Valid sizes for version 1 and
version 2 logs are 16384 (16k) and 32768 (32k). Valid sizes
for version 2 logs also include 65536 (64k), 131072 (128k)
and 262144 (256k). The default value for machines with more
than 32MiB of memory is 32768, machines with less mem- ory
use 16384 by default.</p>

<p>logdev=device and rtdev=device Use an external log
(metadata journal) and/or real-time device. An XFS
filesystem has up to three parts: a data section, a log
section, and a real-time section. The real-time section is
optional, and the log section can be separate from the data
sec- tion or contained within it. Refer to xfs(5).</p>

<p>mtpt=mountpoint Use with the dmapi option. The value
specified here will be included in the DMAPI mount event,
and should be the path of the actual mountpoint that is
used.</p>

<p>noalign Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe
unit boundaries.</p>

<p>noatime Access timestamps are not updated when a file is
read.</p>

<p>norecovery The filesystem will be mounted without
running log recovery. If the filesystem was not cleanly
unmounted, it is likely to be inconsistent when mounted in
norecovery mode. Some files or directories may not be
accessible because of this. Filesystems mounted norecovery
must be mounted read-only or the mount will fail.</p>

<p>nouuid Dont check for double mounted filesystems using
the filesystem uuid. This is useful to mount LVM snapshot
volumes.</p>

<p>osyncisosync Make O_SYNC writes implement true O_SYNC.
WITHOUT this option, Linux XFS behaves as if an osyncisdsync
option is used, which will make writes to files opened with
the O_SYNC flag set behave as if the O_DSYNC flag had been
used instead. This can result in better performance without
compromising data safety. However if this option is not in
effect, timestamp updates from O_SYNC writes can be lost if
the system crashes. If timestamp updates are critical, use
the osyncisosync option.</p>

<p>uquota|usrquota|uqnoenforce|quota User disk quota
accounting enabled, and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer
to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>gquota|grpquota|gqnoenforce Group disk quota accounting
enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer to
xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>pquota|prjquota|pqnoenforce Project disk quota
accounting enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer
to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>sunit=value and swidth=value Used to specify the stripe
unit and width for a RAID device or a stripe volume. value
must be specified in 512-byte block units. If this option is
not specified and the filesystem was made on a stripe volume
or the stripe width or unit were specified for the RAID
device at mkfs time, then the mount system call will restore
the value from the superblock. For filesystems that are made
directly on RAID devices, these options can be used to
override the information in the superblock if the underlying
disk layout changes after the filesystem has been created.
The swidth option is required if the sunit option has been
speci- fied, and must be a multiple of the sunit value.</p>

<p>swalloc Data allocations will be rounded up to stripe
width boundaries when the current end of file is being
extended and the file size is larger than the stripe width
size.</p>

<p>Mount options for xiafs None. Although nothing is wrong
with xiafs, it is not used much, and is not maintained.
Probably one shouldn t use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21
xiafs is no longer part of the kernel source.</p>

<p>THE LOOP DEVICE One further possible type is a mount via
the loop device. For example, the command</p>

<p>mount /tmp/fdimage /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop3</p>

<p>will set up the loop device /dev/loop3 to correspond to
the file /tmp/fdimage, and then mount this device on
/mnt.</p>

<p>This type of mount knows about four options, namely
loop, offset, size- limit and encryption, that are really
options to losetup(8). (These options can be used in
addition to those specific to the filesystem type.)</p>

<p>If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an
option -o loop is given), then mount will try to find some
unused loop device and use that.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.25 is supported auto-destruction of loop
devices and then any loop device allocated by mount will be
freed by umount inde- pendently on /etc/mtab.</p>

<p>You can also free a loop device by hand, using losetup
-d or umount -d.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES mount has the following return codes (the
bits can be ORed):</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 incorrect invocation or permissions</p>

<p>2 system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop
devices)</p>

<p>4 internal mount bug</p>

<p>8 user interrupt</p>

<p>16 problems writing or locking /etc/mtab</p>

<p>32 mount failure</p>

<p>64 some mount succeeded</p>

<p>NOTES The syntax of external mount helpers is:</p>

<p>/sbin/mount.&lt;suffix&gt; spec dir [-sfnv] [-o
options]</p>

<p>where the &lt;suffix&gt; is filesystem type and -sfnvo
options have same meaning like standard mount options.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/fstab filesystem table</p>

<p>/etc/mtab table of mounted filesystems</p>

<p>/etc/mtab~ lock file</p>

<p>/etc/mtab.tmp temporary file</p>

<p>/etc/filesystems a list of filesystem types to try</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mount(2), umount(2), fstab(5), umount(8),
swapon(8), nfs(5), xfs(5), e2label(8), xfs_admin(8),
mountd(8), nfsd(8), mke2fs(8), tune2fs(8), losetup(8)</p>

<p>BUGS It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause
a crash.</p>

<p>Some Linux filesystems dont support -o sync and -o
dirsync (the ext2, ext3, fat and vfat filesystems do support
synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the sync
option).</p>

<p>The -o remount may not be able to change mount
parameters (all ext2fs- specific parameters, except sb, are
changeable with a remount, for example, but you cant change
gid or umask for the fatfs).</p>

<p>Mount by label or uuid will work only if your devices
have the names listed in /proc/partitions. In particular, it
may well fail if the kernel was compiled with devfs but
devfs is not mounted.</p>

<p>It is possible that files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts don
t match. The first file is based only on the mount command
options, but the content of the second file also depends on
the kernel and others settings (e.g. remote NFS server. In
particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts
file usually contains more reliable information.)</p>

<p>Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file
descriptors (i.e. the fcntl and ioctl families of functions)
may lead to inconsistent result due to the lack of
consistency check in kernel even if noac is used.</p>

<p>HISTORY A mount command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The mount command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
