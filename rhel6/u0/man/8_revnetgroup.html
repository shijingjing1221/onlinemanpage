<p>REVNETGROUP(8) Reference Manual REVNETGROUP(8)</p>

<p>NAME revnetgroup - generate reverse netgroup data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib64/yp/revnetgroup [-u|-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Revnetgroup processes the standard input in
netgroup(5) format into what is called reverse netgroup
form. That is, where the original file shows netgroup
memberships in terms of which members reside in a par-
ticular group, the reverse netgroup format specifies what
groups are associated with a particular member. This
information is used to gener- ate the netgroup.byuser and
netgroup.byhosts NIS maps. These reverse netgroup maps are
used to help speed up netgroup lookups, particularly for the
innetgr library function.</p>

<p>The revnetgroup command prints its results on the
standard output. It is usually called only by
/var/yp/Makefile when rebuilding the NIS net- group
maps.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The revnetgroup command supports the following
options:</p>

<p>-u Generate netgroup.byuser output; only username
information in the original netgroup file is processed.</p>

<p>-h Generate netgroup.byhost output; only hostname
information in the original netgroup file is processed.</p>

<p>Note at least one of the both flags must be
specified.</p>

<p>FILES /var/yp/Makefile The Makefile to build the NIS
databases /etc/netgroup the default netgroup database file.
This file is most often found only on the NIS master
server</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getnetgrent(3), netgroup(5),</p>
