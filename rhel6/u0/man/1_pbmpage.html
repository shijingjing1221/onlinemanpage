<p>NAME pbmpage - create a one page test pattern for
printing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmpage [-a4] test_pattern</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmpage generates a one page test pattern to print on a
sheet of paper, for use in calibrating a printer. The test
pattern in is PBM format.</p>

<p>pbmpage produces an image intended for 600 dots per inch
printer reso- lution.</p>

<p>If you are printing on an HP PPA printer, you can
convert the output of this program to a stream that you can
feed to the printer with pbm- toppa.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that when you print the test pattern, you
are testing not only the printer, but any converter or
driver software along the print- ing path. Any one of these
components may adjust margins, crop the image, erase edges,
and such.</p>

<p>If, due to addition of margins, the printer refuses to
print the image because it is too big, use pamcut to cut the
right and bottom edges off the test pattern until it is
small enough to print.</p>

<p>test_pattern is the number of the test pattern to
generate, as fol- lows. The default is 1.</p>

<p>1 A black on white grid ruled in numbers of pixels. A
black one pixel box is at the very edges of the paper.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.18 (August 2003), the perimeter box was
not there.</p>

<p>2 A vertical line segment, one pixel wide, extending 1/2
up from the exact center of the page.</p>

<p>3 Two diagonal line segments, one starting at the upper
left cor- ner of the page, the other starting from the lower
left corner of the page. Both extend 1/2 toward the center
of the page at 45 degrees.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a4 Generate an image for A4 (European) paper.
Without this option, pbmpage generates an image for US
standard paper (8 1/2 wide x 11 high).</p>
