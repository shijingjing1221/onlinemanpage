<p>SYNOPSIS pack after sibling window options ?window

<p>pack before sibling window options ?window options
...?</p>

<p>pack unpack window
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note: this manual entry describes the syntax
for the pack command as it existed before Tk version 3.3.
Although this syntax continues to be supported for backward
compatibility, it is obsolete and should not be used
anymore. At some point in the future it may cease to be sup-
ported.</p>

<p>The packer is a geometry manager that arranges the
children of a parent by packing them in order around the
edges of the parent. The first child is placed against one
side of the window, occupying the entire span of the window
along that side. This reduces the space remaining for other
children as if the side had been moved in by the size of the
first child. Then the next child is placed against one side
of the remaining cavity, and so on until all children have
been placed or there is no space left in the cavity.</p>

<p>The before, after, and append forms of the pack command
are used to insert one or more children into the packing
order for their parent. The before form inserts the children
before window sibling in the order; all of the other windows
must be siblings of sibling. The after form inserts the
windows after sibling, and the append form appends one or
more windows to the end of the packing order for parent. If
a window named in any of these commands is already packed in
its parent, it is removed from its current position in the
packing order and repositioned as indicated by the command.
All of these commands return an empty string as result.</p>

<p>The unpack form of the pack command removes window from
the packing order of its parent and unmaps it. After the
execution of this command the packer will no longer manage
windows geometry.</p>

<p>The placement of each child is actually a four-step
process; the options argument following each window consists
of a list of one or more fields that govern the placement of
that window. In the discus- sion below, the term cavity
refers to the space left in a parent when a particular child
is placed (i.e. all the space that was not claimed by
earlier children in the packing order). The term parcel
refers to the space allocated to a particular child; this is
not necessarily the same as the child windows final
geometry.</p>

<p>The first step in placing a child is to determine which
side of the cavity it will lie against. Any one of the
following options may be used to specify a side:</p>

<p>top Position the childs parcel against the top of the
cavity, occu- pying the full width of the cavity.</p>

<p>bottom Position the childs parcel against the bottom of
the cavity, occupying the full width of the cavity.</p>

<p>left Position the childs parcel against the left side of
the cavity, occupying the full height of the cavity.</p>

<p>right Position the childs parcel against the right side
of the cav- ity, occupying the full height of the
cavity.</p>

<p>At most one of these options should be specified for any
given window. If no side is specified, then the default is
top.</p>

<p>The second step is to decide on a parcel for the child.
For top and bottom windows, the desired parcel width is
normally the cavity width and the desired parcel height is
the window s requested height, as passed to
Tk_GeometryRequest. For left and right windows, the desired
parcel height is normally the cavity height and the desired
width is the windows requested width. However, extra space
may be requested for the window using any of the following
options:</p>

<p>padx num Add num pixels to the windows requested width
before com- puting the parcel size as described above.</p>

<p>pady num Add num pixels to the windows requested height
before com- puting the parcel size as described above.</p>

<p>expand This option requests that the windows parcel
absorb any extra space left over in the parent s cavity
after packing all the children. The amount of space left
over depends on the sizes requested by the other children,
and may be zero. If several windows have all specified
expand then the extra width will be divided equally among
all the left and right windows that specified expand and the
extra height will be divided equally among all the top and
bottom windows that specified expand.</p>

<p>If the desired width or height for a parcel is larger
than the corre- sponding dimension of the cavity, then the
cavity s dimension is used instead.</p>

<p>The third step in placing the window is to decide on the
windows width and height. The default is for the window to
receive either its requested width and height or the those
of the parcel, whichever is smaller. If the parcel is larger
than the window s requested size, then the following options
may be used to expand the window to par- tially or
completely fill the parcel:</p>

<p>fill Set the windows size to equal the parcel size.</p>

<p>fillx Increase the windows width to equal the parcel s
width, but retain the windows requested height.</p>

<p>filly Increase the windows height to equal the parcels
height, but retain the windows requested width.</p>

<p>The last step is to decide the windows location within
its parcel. If the window s size equals the parcels size,
then the window simply fills the entire parcel. If the
parcel is larger than the window, then one of the following
options may be used to specify where the window should be
positioned within its parcel:</p>

<p>frame center Center the window in its parcel. This is
the default if no framing option is specified.</p>

<p>frame n Position the window with its top edge centered
on the top edge of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame ne Position the window with its upper-right corner
at the upper-right corner of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame e Position the window with its right edge centered
on the right edge of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame se Position the window with its lower-right corner
at the lower-right corner of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame s Position the window with its bottom edge
centered on the bottom edge of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame sw Position the window with its lower-left corner
at the lower-left corner of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame w Position the window with its left edge centered
on the left edge of the parcel.</p>

<p>frame nw Position the window with its upper-left corner
at the upper-left corner of the parcel.</p>

<p>The packer manages the mapped/unmapped state of all the
packed children windows. It automatically maps the windows
when it packs them, and it unmaps any windows for which
there was no space left in the cavity.</p>

<p>The packer makes geometry requests on behalf of the
parent windows it manages. For each parent window it
requests a size large enough to accommodate all the options
specified by all the packed children, such that zero space
would be leftover for expand options.</p>
