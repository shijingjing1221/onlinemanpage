<p>XIconifyWindow(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XIconifyWindow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIconifyWindow, XWithdrawWindow,
XReconfigureWMWindow - manipulate top- level windows</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XIconifyWindow(Display *display, Window w,
int screen_number);</p>

<p>Status XWithdrawWindow(Display *display, Window w, int
screen_number);</p>

<p>Status XReconfigureWMWindow(Display *display, Window w,
int screen_num- ber, unsigned int value_mask, XWindowChanges
*values);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>screen_number Specifies the appropriate screen number on
the host server.</p>

<p>value_mask Specifies which values are to be set using
information in the values structure. This mask is the
bitwise inclusive OR of the valid configure window values
bits.</p>

<p>values Specifies the XWindowChanges structure.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XIconifyWindow function sends a
WM_CHANGE_STATE ClientMessage event with a format of 32 and
a first data element of IconicState (as described in section
4.1.4 of the Inter-Client Communication Conven- tions
Manual) and a window of w to the root window of the
specified screen with an event mask set to
SubstructureNotifyMask| Substructur- eRedirectMask. Window
managers may elect to receive this message and if the window
is in its normal state, may treat it as a request to change
the windows state from normal to iconic. If the
WM_CHANGE_STATE property cannot be interned, XIconifyWindow
does not send a message and returns a zero status. It
returns a nonzero status if the client message is sent
successfully; otherwise, it returns a zero status.</p>

<p>The XWithdrawWindow function unmaps the specified window
and sends a synthetic UnmapNotify event to the root window
of the specified screen. Window managers may elect to
receive this message and may treat it as a request to change
the windows state to withdrawn. When a window is in the
withdrawn state, neither its normal nor its iconic
representations is visible. It returns a nonzero status if
the UnmapNotify event is successfully sent; otherwise, it
returns a zero status.</p>

<p>XWithdrawWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XReconfigureWMWindow function issues a
ConfigureWindow request on the specified top-level window.
If the stacking mode is changed and the request fails with a
BadMatch error, the error is trapped by Xlib and a synthetic
ConfigureRequestEvent containing the same configuration
parameters is sent to the root of the specified window.
Window man- agers may elect to receive this event and treat
it as a request to reconfigure the indicated window. It
returns a nonzero status if the request or event is
successfully sent; otherwise, it returns a zero status.</p>

<p>XReconfigureWMWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
