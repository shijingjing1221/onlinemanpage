<p>UNSETENV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNSETENV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME unsetenv - remove an environment variable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int unsetenv(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The unsetenv() function shall remove an
environment variable from the environment of the calling
process. The name argument points to a string, which is the
name of the variable to be removed. The named argument shall
not contain an= character. If the named variable does not
exist in the current environment, the environment shall be
unchanged and the function is considered to have completed
success- fully.</p>

<p>If the application modifies environ or the pointers to
which it points, the behavior of unsetenv() is undefined.
The unsetenv() function shall update the list of pointers to
which environ points.</p>

<p>The unsetenv() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, zero shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, errno set to
indicate the error, and the environment shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS The unsetenv() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The name argument is a null pointer, points to an
empty string, or points to a string containing
an=character.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Refer to the RATIONALE section in
setenv().</p>
