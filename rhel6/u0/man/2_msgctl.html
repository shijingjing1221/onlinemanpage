<p>MSGCTL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MSGCTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME msgctl - message control operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int msgctl(int msqid, int cmd, struct msqid_ds
*buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION msgctl() performs the control operation
specified by cmd on the message queue with identifier
msqid.</p>

<p>The msqid_ds data structure is defined in
&lt;sys/msg.h&gt; as follows:</p>

<p>struct msqid_ds { struct ipc_perm msg_perm; /* Ownership
and permissions */ time_t msg_stime; /* Time of last
msgsnd(2) */ time_t msg_rtime; /* Time of last msgrcv(2) */
time_t msg_ctime; /* Time of last change */ unsigned long
__msg_cbytes; /* Current number of bytes in queue
(non-standard) */ msgqnum_t msg_qnum; /* Current number of
messages in queue */ msglen_t msg_qbytes; /* Maximum number
of bytes allowed in queue */ pid_t msg_lspid; /* PID of last
msgsnd(2) */ pid_t msg_lrpid; /* PID of last msgrcv(2) */
};</p>

<p>The ipc_perm structure is defined in &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
as follows (the high- lighted fields are settable using
IPC_SET):</p>

<p>struct ipc_perm { key_t __key; /* Key supplied to
msgget(2) */ uid_t uid; /* Effective UID of owner */ gid_t
gid; /* Effective GID of owner */ uid_t cuid; /* Effective
UID of creator */ gid_t cgid; /* Effective GID of creator */
unsigned short mode; /* Permissions */ unsigned short __seq;
/* Sequence number */ };</p>

<p>Valid values for cmd are:</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Copy information from the kernel data structure
associated with msqid into the msqid_ds structure pointed to
by buf. The caller must have read permission on the message
queue.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Write the values of some members of the msqid_ds
structure pointed to by buf to the kernel data structure
associated with this message queue, updating also its
msg_ctime member. The following members of the structure are
updated: msg_qbytes, msg_perm.uid, msg_perm.gid, and (the
least significant 9 bits of) msg_perm.mode. The effective
UID of the calling process must match the owner
(msg_perm.uid) or creator (msg_perm.cuid) of the message
queue, or the caller must be privileged. Appro- priate
privilege (Linux: the CAP_IPC_RESOURCE capability) is
required to raise the msg_qbytes value beyond the system
parameter MSGMNB.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Immediately remove the message queue, awakening
all waiting reader and writer processes (with an error
return and errno set to EIDRM). The calling process must
have appropriate privileges or its effective user ID must be
either that of the creator or owner of the message
queue.</p>

<p>IPC_INFO (Linux-specific) Returns information about
system-wide message queue limits and parameters in the
structure pointed to by buf. This structure is of type
msginfo (thus, a cast is required), defined in
&lt;sys/msg.h&gt; if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is
defined:</p>

<p>struct msginfo { int msgpool; /* Size in kibibytes of
buffer pool used to hold message data; unused within kernel
*/ int msgmap; /* Maximum number of entries in message map;
unused within kernel */ int msgmax; /* Maximum number of
bytes that can be written in a single message */ int msgmnb;
/* Maximum number of bytes that can be written to queue;
used to initialize msg_qbytes during queue creation
(msgget(2)) */ int msgmni; /* Maximum number of message
queues */ int msgssz; /* Message segment size; unused within
kernel */ int msgtql; /* Maximum number of messages on all
queues in system; unused within kernel */ unsigned short int
msgseg; /* Maximum number of segments; unused within kernel
*/ };</p>

<p>The msgmni, msgmax, and msgmnb settings can be changed
via /proc files of the same name; see proc(5) for
details.</p>

<p>MSG_INFO (Linux-specific) Returns a msginfo structure
containing the same information as for IPC_INFO, except that
the following fields are returned with information about
system resources consumed by message queues: the msgpool
field returns the number of message queues that cur- rently
exist on the system; the msgmap field returns the total
number of messages in all queues on the system; and the
msgtql field returns the total number of bytes in all
messages in all queues on the system.</p>

<p>MSG_STAT (Linux-specific) Returns a msqid_ds structure
as for IPC_STAT. However, the msqid argument is not a queue
identifier, but instead an index into the kernels internal
array that maintains information about all message queues on
the system.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, IPC_STAT, IPC_SET, and IPC_RMID
return 0. A successful IPC_INFO or MSG_INFO operation
returns the index of the highest used entry in the kernel s
internal array recording information about all message
queues. (This information can be used with repeated MSG_STAT
operations to obtain information about all queues on the
system.) A successful MSG_STAT operation returns the
identifier of the queue whose index was given in msqid.</p>

<p>On error, -1 is returned with errno indicating the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS On failure, errno is set to one of the
following:</p>

<p>EACCES The argument cmd is equal to IPC_STAT or
MSG_STAT, but the call- ing process does not have read
permission on the message queue msqid, and does not have the
CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EFAULT The argument cmd has the value IPC_SET or
IPC_STAT, but the address pointed to by buf isnt
accessible.</p>

<p>EIDRM The message queue was removed.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid value for cmd or msqid. Or: for a
MSG_STAT operation, the index value specified in msqid
referred to an array slot that is currently unused.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd has the value IPC_SET or
IPC_RMID, but the effective user ID of the calling process
is not the creator (as found in msg_perm.cuid) or the owner
(as found in msg_perm.uid) of the message queue, and the
process is not privileged (Linux: it does not have the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The IPC_INFO, MSG_STAT and MSG_INFO operations are
used by the ipcs(8) program to provide information on
allocated resources. In the future these may modified or
moved to a /proc file system interface.</p>

<p>Various fields in the struct msqid_ds were typed as
short under Linux 2.2 and have become long under Linux 2.4.
To take advantage of this, a recompilation under
glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice. (The kernel
distinguishes old and new calls by an IPC_64 flag in
cmd.)</p>
