<p>CONNECT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual CONNECT(2)</p>

<p>NAME connect - initiate a connection on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; /* See NOTES */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
socklen_t addrlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The connect() system call connects the
socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd to the
address specified by addr. The addrlen argu- ment specifies
the size of addr. The format of the address in addr is
determined by the address space of the socket sockfd; see
socket(2) for further details.</p>

<p>If the socket sockfd is of type SOCK_DGRAM then addr is
the address to which datagrams are sent by default, and the
only address from which datagrams are received. If the
socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET, this call
attempts to make a connection to the socket that is bound to
the address specified by addr.</p>

<p>Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may
successfully connect() only once; connectionless protocol
sockets may use connect() multiple times to change their
association. Connectionless sockets may dissolve the
association by connecting to an address with the sa_family
member of sockaddr set to AF_UNSPEC (supported on Linux
since kernel 2.2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the connection or binding succeeds, zero
is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS The following are general socket errors only.
There may be other domain-specific error codes.</p>

<p>EACCES For Unix domain sockets, which are identified by
pathname: Write permission is denied on the socket file, or
search permission is denied for one of the directories in
the path prefix. (See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EACCES, EPERM The user tried to connect to a broadcast
address without having the socket broadcast flag enabled or
the connection request failed because of a local firewall
rule.</p>

<p>EADDRINUSE Local address is already in use.</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT The passed address didnt have the correct
address family in its sa_family field.</p>

<p>EAGAIN No more free local ports or insufficient entries
in the routing cache. For AF_INET see the description of
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range ip(7) for information
on how to increase the number of local ports.</p>

<p>EALREADY The socket is non-blocking and a previous
connection attempt has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor is not a valid index in the
descriptor ta- ble.</p>

<p>ECONNREFUSED No-one listening on the remote address.</p>

<p>EFAULT The socket structure address is outside the users
address space.</p>

<p>EINPROGRESS The socket is non-blocking and the
connection cannot be com- pleted immediately. It is possible
to select(2) or poll(2) for completion by selecting the
socket for writing. After select(2) indicates writability,
use getsockopt(2) to read the SO_ERROR option at level
SOL_SOCKET to determine whether connect() com- pleted
successfully (SO_ERROR is zero) or unsuccessfully (SO_ERROR
is one of the usual error codes listed here, explain- ing
the reason for the failure).</p>

<p>EINTR The system call was interrupted by a signal that
was caught; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EISCONN The socket is already connected.</p>

<p>ENETUNREACH Network is unreachable.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The file descriptor is not associated with a
socket.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT Timeout while attempting connection. The
server may be too busy to accept new connections. Note that
for IP sockets the timeout may be very long when syncookies
are enabled on the server.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, (the connect() function
first appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on
Linux. However, some historical (BSD) implementations
required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.</p>

<p>The third argument of connect() is in reality an int
(and this is what 4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5 have). Some
POSIX confusion resulted in the present socklen_t, also used
by glibc. See also accept(2).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of connect() is shown in
getaddrinfo(3).</p>

socket(2), path_resolu- tion(7)</p>
