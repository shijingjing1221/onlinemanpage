<p>VIRT-V2V.CONF(5) User Contributed Perl Documentation

<p>NAME virt-v2v.conf - configuration file for virt-v2v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-v2v.conf&quot; describes:</p>

<p>&middot; how to map virtual network interface
connections when importing them from another
environment.</p>

<p>&middot; software which can be installed by virt-v2v
during the conversion process.</p>

<p>FORMAT The configuration file is an XML document whose
root element is &lt;virt-v2v&gt;.</p>

<p>Mapping network interface connections When importing a
guest from a different machine and/or hypervisor, it is
likely that the name of the virtual interface its network
devices were connected to will change. For example, a
typical Xen guest will be connected to a bridge device
called xenbrN. This bridge is created by Xen and will not
exist locally by default.</p>

<p>virt-v2v can change these on import to connect to an
appropriate local interface. The mapping is specified by the
&lt;network&gt; element, which is a child of the root
element. The configuration can specify any number of
&lt;network&gt; elements. &lt;network&gt; has 2
attributes:</p>

<p>type type is either bridge, which specifies a bridge to
a local interface, or network , which specifies a locally
managed virtual network. For Xen and ESX guests the source
type will typically be bridge.</p>

<p>name name specifies the name of the given network or
bridge.</p>

<p>The mapping is specified by a nested &lt;network&gt;
element.</p>

<p>The following example specifies that a guest interface
which bridges to xenbr1 should be change to connect to the
local managed network called default:</p>

<p>&lt;network type=&rsquo;bridge&rsquo;
name=&rsquo;xenbr1&rsquo;&gt; &lt;network
type=&rsquo;network&rsquo; name=&rsquo;default&rsquo;/&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;</p>

<p>Specifying software to be installed virt-v2v may have to
install software in a guest during the conversion process to
ensure it boots. An example is replacing a Xen
paravirtualised kernel with a normal kernel. This software
will be specific to the guest operating system.</p>

<p>Capabilities</p>

<p>A capability describes the set of software required for
a specific goal, for example VirtIO support. A capability
describes only direct dependencies. Transitive dependencies
will be resolved by the installation method, for example yum
or &quot;Local Installation&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;capability&gt; is a child of the root element. There
can be any number of &lt;capability&gt; elements. See
&quot;Searching&quot; for a description of the attributes of
&lt;capability&gt; and how they are matched.</p>

<p>Dependencies are specified in the &lt;dep&gt; element,
which has the following attributes:</p>

<p>name The symbolic name of a dependency. On an rpm-based
system this will be the package name. This attribute is
required.</p>

<p>minversion The minimum required version of the software.
For rpm-based systems this must be specified as
[epoch:]version[-release]. This attribute is required.</p>

<p>ifinstalled A dependency must normally be installed if
it is not present, or upgraded if it present but too old. If
ifinstalled is yes, the dependency will be upgraded if is
present but too old, but not installed if it is not already
present.</p>

<p>Local Installation</p>

<p>If it is not possible to install required software using
the guests update agent, the software can be installed from
the conversion host. In this case, it must be specified in
the &lt;app&gt; element. &lt;app&gt; is a child of the root
element. The configuration can specify any number of
&lt;app&gt; elements. See &quot;Searching&quot; for a
description of the attribute of &lt;app&gt; and how they are
matched.</p>

<p>The &lt;app&gt; element must contain a &lt;path&gt;
element, which specifies the path to the software. It may
also contain any number of &lt;dep&gt; elements, which
specify the names of additional applications which may need
to be installed. Each dependency will be resolved in the
same way as its parent, by looking for a match based on os,
distro, major, minor and arch.</p>

<p>virt-v2v will attempt to install dependencies first. A
dependency will only be installed if it is not already
installed, or the installed version is older than the
specified version. On x86_64, virt-v2v will additionally
check if an i386 version need to by updated, but only if any
i386 version of the package is already installed.</p>

<p>Paths given in &lt;path&gt; must be absolute, unless
there is a top level &lt;path-root&gt; element. If it
exists, all &lt;path&gt; elements will be relative to
&lt;path-root&gt;.</p>

<p>virt-v2v passes software to the guest by creating an iso
image and passing it to the guest as a cd-rom drive. The
path to this iso image must be specified in a top level
&lt;iso-path&gt; element.</p>

<p>The following example specifies the location of kernel
for RHEL 5, all minor versions, on i686:</p>

<p>&lt;app os=&rsquo;linux&rsquo; distro=&rsquo;rhel&rsquo;
major=&rsquo;5&rsquo; arch=&rsquo;i686&rsquo;
name=&rsquo;kernel&rsquo;&gt;
&lt;path&gt;rhel/5/kernel-2.6.18-128.el5.i686.rpm&lt;/path&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;ecryptfs-utils&lt;/dep&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;lvm2&lt;/dep&gt; &lt;/app&gt; &lt;app
os=&rsquo;linux&rsquo; distro=&rsquo;rhel&rsquo;
major=&rsquo;5&rsquo; arch=&rsquo;i386&rsquo;
name=&rsquo;ecryptfs-utils&rsquo;&gt;
&lt;path&gt;rhel/5/ecryptfs-utils-56-8.el5.i386.rpm&lt;/path&gt;
&lt;/app&gt; &lt;app os=&rsquo;linux&rsquo;
distro=&rsquo;rhel&rsquo; major=&rsquo;5&rsquo;
arch=&rsquo;i386&rsquo; name=&rsquo;lvm2&rsquo;&gt;
&lt;path&gt;rhel/5/lvm2-2.02.40-6.el5.i386.rpm&lt;/path&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;device-mapper&lt;/dep&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;device-mapper-event&lt;/dep&gt; &lt;/app&gt;</p>


<p>&lt;path-root&gt;/var/lib/virt-v2v/software&lt;/path-root&gt;
&lt;iso-path&gt;/var/lib/virt-v2v/transfer.iso&lt;/iso-path&gt;</p>

<p>The kernel can be found at
/var/lib/virt-v2v/software/rhel/5/kernel-2.6.18-128.el5.i686.rpm.
It has 2 direct dependencies: ecryptfs and lvm2.
ecryptfs-utils has no additional dependencies, but lvm2 has
2 further dependencies (not shown for brevity). All
dependencies will also be installed if they are not present,
or are too old. All dependency paths are also relative to
/var/lib/virt-v2v/software. virt-v2v will create a transfer
iso image containing all paths and dependencies at
/var/lib/virt-v2v/transfer.iso.</p>

<p>Searching</p>

<p>Both &lt;capability&gt; and &lt;app&gt; are matched in
the same way, based on the following attributes:</p>

<p>name The symbolic name of the software virt-v2v is
looking for. name is a mandatory attribute.</p>

<p>os The name of the guest operating system, as returned
by virt- inspector. This will be a string, like linux or
windows.</p>

<p>distro When os= linux , this is the Linux distribution
as returned by virt-inspector. Possible values include rhel,
debian.</p>

<p>major The major version name of the guest operating
system, as returned by virt-inspector.</p>

<p>minor The minor version name of the guest operating
system, as returned by virt-inspector.</p>

<p>arch The guest architecture, as returned by
virt-inspector.</p>

<p>virt-v2v searches for an &lt;app&gt; or
&lt;capability&gt; by symbolic name, matching based on its
additional attributes. If an attribute is missing it will
match any value. If multiple elements would match a given
search, virt-v2v will choose the most specific match.
Specifically, it searches in the following order:</p>

<p>&middot; os, distro, major, minor, arch</p>

<p>&middot; os, distro, major, minor</p>

<p>&middot; os, distro, major, arch</p>

<p>&middot; os, distro, major</p>

<p>&middot; os, distro</p>

<p>&middot; os</p>

<p>If virt-v2v doesnt find a match it will quit with an
error describing what it was looking for.</p>
