<p>MMAP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MMAP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mmap - map pages of memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *mmap(void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags,
int fildes, off_t off);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mmap() function shall establish a
mapping between a process address space and a file, shared
memory object, or typed memory object. The format of the
call is as follows:</p>

<p>pa=mmap(addr, len, prot, flags, fildes, off);</p>

<p>The mmap() function shall establish a mapping between
the address space of the process at an address pa for len
bytes to the memory object rep- resented by the file
descriptor fildes at offset off for len bytes. The value of
pa is an implementation-defined function of the parameter
addr and the values of flags, further described below. A
successful mmap() call shall return pa as its result. The
address range starting at pa and continuing for len bytes
shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily
current) address space of the process. The range of bytes
starting at off and continuing for len bytes shall be
legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current)
offsets in the file, shared memory object, or typed memory
object represented by fildes.</p>

<p>If fildes represents a typed memory object opened with
either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to
be mapped shall be that portion of the typed memory object
allocated by the implementation as specified below. In this
case, if off is non-zero, the behavior of mmap() is
undefined. If fildes refers to a valid typed memory object
that is not accessible from the calling process, mmap()
shall fail.</p>

<p>The mapping established by mmap() shall replace any
previous mappings for those whole pages containing any part
of the address space of the process starting at pa and
continuing for len bytes.</p>

<p>If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to
mmap() as a result of some other operation on the mapped
file, the effect of refer- ences to portions of the mapped
region that correspond to added or removed portions of the
file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The mmap() function shall be supported for regular
files, shared memory objects, and typed memory objects.
Support for any other type of file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The parameter prot determines whether read, write,
execute, or some combination of accesses are permitted to
the data being mapped. The prot shall be either PROT_NONE or
the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the other flags
in the following table, defined in the &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
header.</p>

<p>Symbolic Constant Description PROT_READ Data can be
read. PROT_WRITE Data can be written. PROT_EXEC Data can be
executed. PROT_NONE Data cannot be accessed.</p>

<p>If an implementation cannot support the combination of
access types specified by prot, the call to mmap() shall
fail.</p>

<p>An implementation may permit accesses other than those
specified by prot; however, if the Memory Protection option
is supported, the implementation shall not permit a write to
succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set or shall not
permit any access where PROT_NONE alone has been set. The
implementation shall support at least the following val- ues
of prot: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the
bitwise-inclu- sive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE. If the
Memory Protection option is not supported, the result of any
access that conflicts with the specified protection is
undefined. The file descriptor fildes shall have been opened
with read permission, regardless of the protection options
specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified, the application shall
ensure that it has opened the file descriptor fildes with
write permis- sion unless MAP_PRIVATE is specified in the
flags parameter as described below.</p>

<p>The parameter flags provides other information about the
handling of the mapped data. The value of flags is the
bitwise-inclusive OR of these options, defined in
&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;:</p>

<p>Symbolic Constant Description MAP_SHARED Changes are
shared. MAP_PRIVATE Changes are private. MAP_FIXED Interpret
addr exactly.</p>

<p>Implementations that do not support the Memory Mapped
Files option are not required to support MAP_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether MAP_FIXED shall be
supported. MAP_FIXED shall be supported on XSI-conformant
systems.</p>

<p>MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of
write references to the memory object. If MAP_SHARED is
specified, write references shall change the underlying
object. If MAP_PRIVATE is specified, modi- fications to the
mapped data by the calling process shall be visible only to
the calling process and shall not change the underlying
object. It is unspecified whether modifications to the
underlying object done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is
established are visible through the MAP_PRIVATE mapping.
Either MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not
both. The mapping type is retained across fork().</p>

<p>When fildes represents a typed memory object opened with
either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, mmap() shall, if there
are enough resources available, map len bytes allocated from
the corresponding typed memory object which were not
previously allocated to any process in any processor that
may access that typed memory object. If there are not enough
resources available, the function shall fail. If fildes
represents a typed memory object opened with the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these allocated bytes
shall be contiguous within the typed memory object. If
fildes represents a typed memory object opened with the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these allocated bytes may be
composed of non-contiguous fragments within the typed memory
object. If fildes rep- resents a typed memory object opened
with neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor
the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, len bytes starting at
offset off within the typed memory object are mapped,
exactly as when mapping a file or shared memory object. In
this case, if two processes map an area of typed memory
using the same off and len values and using file descriptors
that refer to the same memory pool (either from the same
port or from a different port), both processes shall map the
same region of storage.</p>

<p>When MAP_FIXED is set in the flags argument, the
implementation is informed that the value of pa shall be
addr, exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, mmap() may return
MAP_FAILED and set errno to [EINVAL]. If a MAP_FIXED request
is successful, the mapping established by mmap() replaces
any previous mappings for the process pages in the range
[pa,pa+len).</p>

<p>When MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses addr
in an implemen- tation-defined manner to arrive at pa. The
pa so chosen shall be an area of the address space that the
implementation deems suitable for a mapping of len bytes to
the file. All implementations interpret an addr value of 0
as granting the implementation complete freedom in selecting
pa, subject to constraints described below. A non-zero value
of addr is taken to be a suggestion of a process address
near which the mapping should be placed. When the
implementation selects a value for pa, it never places a
mapping at address 0, nor does it replace any extant
mapping.</p>

<p>The off argument is constrained to be aligned and sized
according to the value returned by sysconf() when passed
_SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. When MAP_FIXED is specified,
the application shall ensure that the argument addr also
meets these constraints. The imple- mentation performs
mapping operations over whole pages. Thus, while the
argument len need not meet a size or alignment constraint,
the imple- mentation shall include, in any mapping
operation, any partial page specified by the range
[pa,pa+len).</p>

<p>The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at
the end of an object. Further, the system shall never write
out any modified portions of the last page of an object
which are beyond its end. References within the address
range starting at pa and continuing for len bytes to whole
pages following the end of an object shall result in
delivery of a SIGBUS signal.</p>

<p>An implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a
reference would cause an error in the mapped object, such as
out-of-space condition.</p>

<p>The mmap() function shall add an extra reference to the
file associated with the file descriptor fildes which is not
removed by a subsequent close() on that file descriptor.
This reference shall be removed when there are no more
mappings to the file.</p>

<p>The st_atime field of the mapped file may be marked for
update at any time between the mmap() call and the
corresponding munmap() call. The initial read or write
reference to a mapped region shall cause the files st_atime
field to be marked for update if it has not already been
marked for update.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of a file that is
mapped with MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be marked for
update at some point in the interval between a write
reference to the mapped region and the next call to msync()
with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion of the file by any
process. If there is no such call and if the underlying file
is modified as a result of a write reference, then these
fields shall be marked for update at some time after the
write reference.</p>

<p>There may be implementation-defined limits on the number
of memory regions that can be mapped (per process or per
system).</p>

<p>If such a limit is imposed, whether the number of memory
regions that can be mapped by a process is decreased by the
use of shmat() is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If mmap() fails for reasons other than [EBADF],
[EINVAL], or [ENOTSUP], some of the mappings in the address
range starting at addr and continu- ing for len bytes may
have been unmapped.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the mmap()
function shall return the address at which the mapping was
placed ( pa); otherwise, it shall return a value of
MAP_FAILED and set errno to indicate the error. The symbol
MAP_FAILED is defined in the &lt;sys/mman.h&gt; header. No
successful return from mmap() shall return the value
MAP_FAILED.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mmap() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The fildes argument is not open for read,
regardless of the pro- tection specified, or fildes is not
open for write and PROT_WRITE was specified for a MAP_SHARED
type mapping.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The mapping could not be locked in memory, if
required by mlock- all(), due to a lack of resources.</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The addr argument (if MAP_FIXED was specified) or
off is not a multiple of the page size as returned by
sysconf(), or is con- sidered invalid by the
implementation.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of flags is invalid (neither
MAP_PRIVATE nor MAP_SHARED is set).</p>

<p>EMFILE The number of mapped regions would exceed an
implementation- defined limit (per process or per
system).</p>

<p>ENODEV The fildes argument refers to a file whose type
is not supported by mmap().</p>

<p>ENOMEM MAP_FIXED was specified, and the range
[addr,addr+len) exceeds that allowed for the address space
of a process; or, if MAP_FIXED was not specified and there
is insufficient room in the address space to effect the
mapping.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The mapping could not be locked in memory, if
required by mlock- all(), because it would require more
space than the system is able to supply.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Not enough unallocated memory resources remain in
the typed mem- ory object designated by fildes to allocate
len bytes.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP MAP_FIXED or MAP_PRIVATE was specified in the
flags argument and the implementation does not support this
functionality.</p>

<p>The implementation does not support the combination of
accesses requested in the prot argument.</p>

<p>ENXIO Addresses in the range [off,off+len) are invalid
for the object specified by fildes.</p>

<p>ENXIO MAP_FIXED was specified in flags and the
combination of addr, len, and off is invalid for the object
specified by fildes.</p>

<p>ENXIO The fildes argument refers to a typed memory
object that is not accessible from the calling process.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file is a regular file and the value of
off plus len exceeds the offset maximum established in the
open file description associated with fildes.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Use of mmap() may reduce the amount of
memory available to other memory allocation functions.</p>

<p>Use of MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in
further use of malloc() and shmat(). The use of MAP_FIXED is
discouraged, as it may prevent an implementation from making
the most effective use of resources.</p>

<p>The application must ensure correct synchronization when
using mmap() in conjunction with any other file access
method, such as read() and write(), standard input/output,
and shmat().</p>

<p>The mmap() function allows access to resources via
address space manip- ulations, instead of read()/ write().
Once a file is mapped, all a pro- cess has to do to access
it is use the data at the address to which the file was
mapped. So, using pseudo-code to illustrate the way in which
an existing program might be changed to use mmap(), the
following:</p>

<p>fildes = open(...) lseek(fildes, some_offset)
read(fildes, buf, len) /* Use data in buf. */</p>

<p>becomes:</p>

<p>fildes = open(...) address = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ,
MAP_PRIVATE, fildes, some_offset) /* Use data at address.
*/</p>

<p>RATIONALE After considering several other alternatives,
it was decided to adopt the mmap() definition found in SVR4
for mapping memory objects into process address spaces. The
SVR4 definition is minimal, in that it describes only what
has been built, and what appears to be necessary for a
general and portable mapping facility.</p>

<p>Note that while mmap() was first designed for mapping
files, it is actually a general-purpose mapping facility. It
can be used to map any appropriate object, such as memory,
files, devices, and so on, into the address space of a
process.</p>

<p>When a mapping is established, it is possible that the
implementation may need to map more than is requested into
the address space of the process because of hardware
requirements. An application, however, can- not count on
this behavior. Implementations that do not use a paged
architecture may simply allocate a common memory region and
return the address of it; such implementations probably do
not allocate any more than is necessary. References past the
end of the requested area are unspecified.</p>

<p>If an application requests a mapping that would overlay
existing map- pings in the process, it might be desirable
that an implementation detect this and inform the
application. However, the default, portable (not MAP_FIXED)
operation does not overlay existing mappings. On the other
hand, if the program specifies a fixed address mapping
(which requires some implementation knowledge to determine a
suitable address, if the function is supported at all), then
the program is presumed to be successfully managing its own
address space and should be trusted when it asks to map over
existing data structures. Furthermore, it is also desirable
to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be
considered onerous to require an munmap() before an mmap()
to the same address range. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 specifies that the new mappings replace any
existing mappings, following existing practice in this
regard.</p>

<p>It is not expected, when the Memory Protection option is
supported, that all hardware implementations are able to
support all combinations of permissions at all addresses.
When this option is supported, imple- mentations are
required to disallow write access to mappings without write
permission and to disallow access to mappings without any
access permission. Other than these restrictions,
implementations may allow access types other than those
requested by the application. For exam- ple, if the
application requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may
also allow read access. A call to mmap() fails if the
implementa- tion cannot support allowing all the access
requested by the applica- tion. For example, some
implementations cannot support a request for both write
access and execute access simultaneously. All implementa-
tions supporting the Memory Protection option must support
requests for no access, read access, write access, and both
read and write access. Strictly conforming code must only
rely on the required checks. These restrictions allow for
portability across a wide range of hardware.</p>

<p>The MAP_FIXED address treatment is likely to fail for
non-page-aligned values and for certain
architecture-dependent address ranges. Conform- ing
implementations cannot count on being able to choose address
values for MAP_FIXED without utilizing non-portable,
implementation-defined knowledge. Nonetheless, MAP_FIXED is
provided as a standard interface conforming to existing
practice for utilizing such knowledge when it is
available.</p>

<p>Similarly, in order to allow implementations that do not
support vir- tual addresses, support for directly specifying
any mapping addresses via MAP_FIXED is not required and thus
a conforming application may not count on it.</p>

<p>The MAP_PRIVATE function can be implemented efficiently
when memory protection hardware is available. When such
hardware is not available, implementations can implement
such &quot;mappings&quot; by simply making a real copy of
the relevant data into process private memory, though this
tends to behave similarly to read().</p>

<p>The function has been defined to allow for many
different models of using shared memory. However, all uses
are not equally portable across all machine architectures.
In particular, the mmap() function allows the system as well
as the application to specify the address at which to map a
specific region of a memory object. The most portable way to
use the function is always to let the system choose the
address, speci- fying NULL as the value for the argument
addr and not to specify MAP_FIXED.</p>

<p>If it is intended that a particular region of a memory
object be mapped at the same address in a group of processes
(on machines where this is even possible), then MAP_FIXED
can be used to pass in the desired map- ping address. The
system can still be used to choose the desired address if
the first such mapping is made without specifying MAP_FIXED,
and then the resulting mapping address can be passed to
subsequent pro- cesses for them to pass in via MAP_FIXED.
The availability of a spe- cific address range cannot be
guaranteed, in general.</p>

<p>The mmap() function can be used to map a region of
memory that is larger than the current size of the object.
Memory access within the mapping but beyond the current end
of the underlying objects may result in SIGBUS signals being
sent to the process. The reason for this is that the size of
the object can be manipulated by other processes and can
change at any moment. The implementation should tell the
applica- tion that a memory reference is outside the object
where this can be detected; otherwise, written data may be
lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the
object.</p>

<p>Note that references beyond the end of the object do not
extend the object as the new end cannot be determined
precisely by most virtual memory hardware. Instead, the size
can be directly manipulated by ftruncate().</p>

<p>Process memory locking does apply to shared memory
regions, and the MEMLOCK_FUTURE argument to mlockall() can
be relied upon to cause new shared memory regions to be
automatically locked.</p>

<p>Existing implementations of mmap() return the value -1
when unsuccess- ful. Since the casting of this value to type
void * cannot be guaran- teed by the ISO C standard to be
distinct from a successful value, this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defines the symbol MAP_FAILED, which a
conforming implementation does not return as the result of a
successful call.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
