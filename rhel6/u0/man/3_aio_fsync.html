<p>AIO_FSYNC(3) Linux Programmer s Manual AIO_FSYNC(3)</p>

<p>NAME aio_fsync - asynchronous file synchronization</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_fsync(int op, struct aiocb *aiocbp);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_fsync() function does a sync on all
outstanding asynchronous I/O operations associated with
aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>More precisely, if op is O_SYNC, then all currently
queued I/O opera- tions shall be completed as if by a call
of fsync(2), and if op is O_DSYNC, this call is the
asynchronous analog of fdatasync(2). Note that this is a
request only this call does not wait for I/O comple-
tion.</p>

<p>Apart from aio_fildes the only field in the structure
pointed to by aiocbp that is used by this call is the
aio_sigevent field (a struct sigevent) that indicates the
desired type of asynchronous notification at completion. All
other fields are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success (the sync request was
successfully queued) this function returns 0. On error -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN Out of resources.</p>

<p>EBADF aio_fildes is not a valid file descriptor open for
writing.</p>

<p>EINVAL No synchronized I/O for this file is supported,
or op is not O_SYNC or O_DSYNC.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

aio_return(3), aio_sus- pend(3), aio_write(3)</p>
