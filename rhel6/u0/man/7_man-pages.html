<p>MAN-PAGES(7) Linux Programmer s Manual MAN-PAGES(7)</p>

<p>NAME man-pages - conventions for writing Linux man
pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS man [section] title</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This page describes the conventions that
should be employed when writ- ing man pages for the Linux
man-pages project, which comprises Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and
7 of the Linux manual pages. The conventions described on
this page may also be useful for authors writing man pages
for other projects.</p>

<p>Sections of the Manual Pages The manual Sections are
traditionally defined as follows:</p>

<p>1 Commands (Programs) Those commands that can be
executed by the user from within a shell.</p>

<p>2 System calls Those functions which must be performed
by the kernel.</p>

<p>3 Library calls Most of the libc functions.</p>

<p>4 Special files (devices) Files found in /dev.</p>

<p>5 File formats and conventions The format for
/etc/passwd and other human-readable files.</p>

<p>6 Games</p>

<p>7 Conventions and miscellaneous Overviews of various
topics, conventions and protocols, char- acter set
standards, and miscellaneous other things.</p>

<p>8 System management commands Commands like mount(8),
many of which only root can execute.</p>

<p>Macro package New manual pages should be marked up using
the groff an.tmac package described in man(7). This choice
is mainly for consistency: the vast majority of existing
Linux manual pages are marked up using these macros.</p>

<p>Conventions for source file layout Please limit source
code line length to no more than about 75 charac- ters
wherever possible. This helps avoid line-wrapping in some
mail clients when patches are submitted inline.</p>

<p>New sentences should be started on new lines. This makes
it easier to see the effect of patches, which often operate
at the level of individ- ual sentences.</p>

<p>Title line The first command in a man page should be a
TH command:</p>

<p>.TH title section date source manual</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>title The title of the man page, written in all caps
(e.g., MAN-PAGES).</p>

<p>section The section number in which the man page should
be placed (e.g., 7).</p>

<p>date The date of the last revision remember to change
this every time a change is made to the man page, since this
is the most general way of doing version control. Dates
should be written in the form YYYY-MM- DD.</p>

<p>source The source of the command, function, or system
call.</p>

<p>For those few man-pages pages in Sections 1 and 8,
probably you just want to write GNU.</p>

<p>For system calls, just write Linux. (An earlier prac-
tice was to write the version number of the kernel from
which the manual page was being written/checked. However,
this was never done consistently, and so was probably worse
than including no version number. Henceforth, avoid
including a version number.)</p>

<p>For library calls that are part of glibc or one of the
other common GNU libraries, just use GNU C Library, GNU, or
an empty string.</p>

<p>For Section 4 pages, use Linux.</p>

<p>In cases of doubt, just write Linux, or GNU.</p>

<p>manual The title of the manual (e.g., for Section 2 and
3 pages in the man-pages package, use Linux Programmers
Manual).</p>

<p>Sections within a manual page The list below shows
conventional or suggested sections. Most manual pages should
include at least the highlighted sections. Arrange a new
manual page so that sections are placed in the order shown
in the list.</p>

<p>NAME SYNOPSIS CONFIGURATION [Normally only in Section 4]
DESCRIPTION OPTIONS [Normally only in Sections 1, 8] EXIT
STATUS [Normally only in Sections 1, 8] RETURN VALUE
[Normally only in Sections 2, 3] ERRORS [Typically only in
Sections 2, 3] ENVIRONMENT FILES VERSIONS [Normally only in
Sections 2, 3] CONFORMING TO NOTES BUGS EXAMPLE SEE ALSO</p>

<p>Where a traditional heading would apply, please use it;
this kind of consistency can make the information easier to
understand. If you must, you can create your own headings if
they make things easier to understand (this can be
especially useful for pages in Sections 4 and 5). However,
before doing this, consider whether you could use the
traditional headings, with some subsections (.SS) within
those sec- tions.</p>

<p>The following list elaborates on the contents of each of
the above sec- tions.</p>

<p>NAME The name of this manual page. See man(7) for
important details of the line(s) that should follow the .SH
NAME command.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS briefly describes the command or function s
interface. For commands, this shows the syntax of the
command and its arguments (including options); boldface is
used for as-is text and italics are used to indicate
replaceable arguments. Brackets ([]) surround optional
arguments, vertical bars (|) separate choices, and ellipses
(...) can be repeated. For functions, it shows any required
data declarations or #include directives, followed by the
function declaration.</p>

<p>Where a feature test macro must be defined in order to
obtain the declaration of a function (or a variable) from a
header file, then the SYNOPSIS should indicate this, as
described in feature_test_macros(7).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Configuration details for a device. This
section nor- mally only appears in Section 4 pages.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gives an explanation of what the program,
function, or format does. Discuss how it interacts with
files and standard input, and what it produces on standard
output or standard error. Omit internals and implementation
details unless they re critical for understanding the
interface. Describe the usual case; for information on
command-line options of a program use the OPTIONS sec-
tion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS describes the command-line options accepted by a
program and how they change its behavior. This section
should only appear for Section 1 and 8 manual pages.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS lists the possible exit status values of a
program and the conditions that cause these values to be
returned. This section should only appear for Section 1 and
8 man- ual pages.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE For Section 2 and 3 pages, this section
gives a list of the values the library routine will return
to the caller and the conditions that cause these values to
be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS For Section 2 and 3 manual pages, this is a list
of the values that may be placed in errno in the event of an
error, along with information about the cause of the errors.
The error list should be in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT lists all environment variables that affect
the program or function and how they affect it.</p>

<p>FILES lists the files the program or function uses, such
as configuration files, startup files, and files the program
directly operates on. Give the full pathname of these files,
and use the installation process to modify the directory
part to match user preferences. For many pro- grams, the
default installation location is in /usr/local, so your base
manual page should use /usr/local as the base.</p>

<p>VERSIONS A brief summary of the Linux kernel or glibc
versions where a system call or library function appeared,
or changed significantly in its operation. As a general
rule, every new interface should include a VERSIONS sec-
tion in its manual page. Unfortunately, many existing manual
pages dont include this information (since there was no
policy to do so when they were written). Patches to remedy
this are welcome, but, from the perspective of programmers
writing new code, this information probably only matters in
the case of kernel interfaces that have been added in Linux
2.4 or later (i.e., changes since kernel 2.2), and library
functions that have been added to glibc since version 2.1
(i.e., changes since glibc 2.0).</p>

<p>The syscalls(2) manual page also provides information
about kernel versions in which various system calls first
appeared.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO describes any standards or conventions
that relate to the function or command described by the
manual page. For a page in Section 2 or 3, this section
should note the POSIX.1 version(s) that the call conforms
to, and also whether the call is specified in C99. (Dont
worry too much about other standards like SUS, SUSv2, and
XPG, or the SVr4 and 4.xBSD implementation standards, unless
the call was specified in those standards, but isnt in the
current version of POSIX.1.) (See standards(7).)</p>

<p>If the call is not governed by any standards but
commonly exists on other systems, note them. If the call is
Linux-specific, note this.</p>

<p>If this section consists of just a list of standards
(which it commonly does), terminate the list with a period
(&rsquo;.&rsquo;).</p>

<p>NOTES provides miscellaneous notes. For Section 2 and 3
man pages you may find it useful to include subsections (SS)
named Linux Notes and Glibc Notes.</p>

<p>BUGS lists limitations, known defects or inconveniences,
and other questionable activities.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE provides one or more examples describing how
this func- tion, file or command is used. For details on
writing example programs, see Example Programs below.</p>

<p>AUTHORS lists authors of the documentation or program.
Use of an AUTHORS section is strongly discouraged.
Generally, it is better not to clutter every page with a
list of (over time potentially numerous) authors; if you
write or sig- nificantly amend a page, add a copyright
notice as a com- ment in the source file. If you are the
author of a device driver and want to include an address for
report- ing bugs, place this under the BUGS section.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO provides a comma-separated list of related man
pages, ordered by section number and then alphabetically by
name, possibly followed by other related pages or docu-
ments. Do not terminate this with a period.</p>

<p>Font conventions For functions, the arguments are always
specified using italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section, where
the rest of the function is specified in bold:</p>

<p>int myfunction(int argc, char **argv);</p>

<p>Variable names should, like argument names, be specified
in italics.</p>

<p>Filenames (whether pathnames, or references to files in
the /usr/include directory) are always in italics (e.g.,
&lt;stdio.h&gt;), except in the SYNOPSIS section, where
included files are in bold (e.g., #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;).
When referring to a standard include file under
/usr/include, specify the header file surrounded by angle
brackets, in the usual C way (e.g., &lt;stdio.h&gt;).</p>

<p>Special macros, which are usually in upper case, are in
bold (e.g., MAXINT). Exception: dont boldface NULL.</p>

<p>When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in
bold (this list usually uses the .TP macro).</p>

<p>Complete commands should, if long, be written as in an
indented line on their own, for example</p>

<p>man 7 man-pages</p>

<p>If the command is short, then it can be included inline
in the text, in italic format, for example, man 7 man-pages.
In this case, it may be worth using non-breaking spaces
(&quot; &quot;) at suitable places in the com- mand. Command
options should be written in italics, e.g., -l.</p>

<p>Expressions, if not written on a separate indented line,
should be specified in italics. Again, the use of
non-breaking spaces may be appropriate if the expression is
inlined with normal text.</p>

<p>Any reference to the subject of the current manual page
should be writ- ten with the name in bold. If the subject is
a function (i.e., this is a Section 2 or 3 page), then the
name should be followed by a pair of parentheses in Roman
(normal) font. For example, in the fcntl(2) man page,
references to the subject of the page would be written as:
fcntl(). The preferred way to write this in the source file
is:</p>

<p>.BR fcntl ()</p>

<p>(Using this format, rather than the use of
&quot;<b>...</b>()&quot; makes it eas- ier to write tools
that parse man page source files.)</p>

<p>Any reference to another man page should be written with
the name in bold, always followed by the section number,
formatted in Roman (nor- mal) font, without any separating
spaces (e.g., intro(2)). The pre- ferred way to write this
in the source file is:</p>

<p>.BR intro (2)</p>

<p>(Including the section number in cross references lets
tools like man2html(1) create properly hyperlinked
pages.)</p>

<p>Spelling Starting with release 2.59, man-pages follows
American spelling conven- tions; please write all new pages
and patches according to these con- ventions.</p>

<p>Example Programs and Shell Sessions Manual pages can
include example programs demonstrating how to use a system
call or library function. However, note the following:</p>

<p>* Example programs should be written in C.</p>

<p>* An example program is only necessary and useful if it
demonstrates something beyond what can easily be provided in
a textual description of the interface. An example program
that does nothing other than call an interface usually
serves little purpose.</p>

<p>* Example programs should be fairly short (preferably
less than 100 lines; ideally less than 50 lines).</p>

<p>* Example programs should do error checking after system
calls and library function calls.</p>

<p>* Example programs should be complete, and compile
without warnings when compiled with cc -Wall.</p>

<p>* Where possible and appropriate, example programs
should allow exper- imentation, by varying their behavior
based on inputs (ideally from command-line arguments, or
alternatively, via input read by the pro- gram).</p>

<p>* Example programs should be laid out according to
Kernighan and Ritchie style, with 4-space indents. (Avoid
the use of TAB charac- ters in source code!)</p>

<p>For some examples of what example programs should look
like, see wait(2) and pipe(2).</p>

<p>If you include a shell session demonstrating the use of
a program or other system feature, boldface the user input
text, to distinguish it from output produced by the
system.</p>

<p>Indentation of structure definitions, shell session
logs, etc. When structure definitions, shell session logs,
etc. are included in running text, indent them by 4 spaces
(i.e., a block enclosed by .in +4n and .in).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE For canonical examples of how man pages in the
man-pages package should look, see pipe(2) and fcntl(2).</p>
