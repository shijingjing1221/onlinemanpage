<p>MYSQLD(8) MySQL Database System MYSQLD(8)</p>

<p>NAME mysqld - the MySQL server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqld [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysqld, also known as MySQL Server, is the
main program that does most of the work in a MySQL
installation. MySQL Server manages access to the MySQL data
directory that contains databases and tables. The data
directory is also the default location for other information
such as log files and status files.</p>

<p>When MySQL server starts, it listens for network
connections from client programs and manages access to
databases on behalf of those clients.</p>

<p>The mysqld program has many options that can be
specified at startup. For a complete list of options, run
this command:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqld --verbose --help</p>

<p>MySQL Server also has a set of system variables that
affect its operation as it runs. System variables can be set
at server startup, and many of them can be changed at
runtime to effect dynamic server reconfiguration. MySQL
Server also has a set of status variables that provide
information about its operation. You can monitor these
status variables to access runtime performance
characteristics.</p>

<p>For a full description of MySQL Server command options,
system variables, and status variables, see Section 5.1, The
MySQL Server. For information about installing MySQL and
setting up the initial configuration, see Chapter 2,
Installing and Upgrading MySQL.</p>
