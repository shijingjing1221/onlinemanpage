<p>DESCRIPTION Perl s source code, and extensions that want
maximum portability, should use the above functions instead
of those defined in ANSI Cs stdio.h. The perl headers (in
particular &quot;perlio.h&quot;) will &quot;#define&quot;
them to the I/O mechanism selected at Configure time.</p>

<p>The functions are modeled on those in stdio.h, but
parameter order has been &quot;tidied up a little&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;PerlIO *&quot; takes the place of FILE *. Like
FILE * it should be treated as opaque (it is probably safe
to assume it is a pointer to something).</p>

<p>There are currently three implementations:</p>

<p>1. USE_STDIO All above are #define d to stdio functions
or are trivial wrapper functions which call stdio. In this
case only PerlIO * is a FILE *. This has been the default
implementation since the abstraction was introduced in
perl5.003_02.</p>

<p>2. USE_SFIO A &quot;legacy&quot; implementation in terms
of the &quot;sfio&quot; library. Used for some specialist
applications on Unix machines (&quot;sfio&quot; is not
widely ported away from Unix). Most of above are #defined to
the sfio functions. PerlIO * is in this case Sfio_t *.</p>

<p>3. USE_PERLIO Introduced just after perl5.7.0, this is a
re-implementation of the above abstraction which allows perl
more control over how IO is done as it decouples IO from the
way the operating system and C library choose to do things.
For USE_PERLIO PerlIO * has an extra layer of indirection -
it is a pointer-to-a-pointer. This allows the PerlIO * to
remain with a known value while swapping the implementation
around underneath at run time. In this case all the above
are true (but very simple) functions which call the
underlying implementation.</p>

<p>This is the only implementation for which
&quot;PerlIO_apply_layers()&quot; does anything
&quot;interesting&quot;.</p>

<p>The USE_PERLIO implementation is described in
perliol.</p>

<p>Because &quot;perlio.h&quot; is a thin layer (for
efficiency) the semantics of these functions are somewhat
dependent on the underlying implementation. Where these
variations are understood they are noted below.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, functions return 0 on success,
or a negative value (usually &quot;EOF&quot; which is
usually -1) and set &quot;errno&quot; on error.</p>

<p>PerlIO_stdin(), PerlIO_stdout(), PerlIO_stderr() Use
these rather than &quot;stdin&quot;, &quot;stdout&quot;,
&quot;stderr&quot;. They are written to look like
&quot;function calls&quot; rather than variables because
this makes it easier to make them function calls if platform
cannot export data to loaded modules, or if (say) different
&quot;threads&quot; might have different values.</p>

<p>PerlIO_open(path, mode), PerlIO_fdopen(fd,mode) These
correspond to fopen()/fdopen() and the arguments are the
same. Return &quot;NULL&quot; and set &quot;errno&quot; if
there is an error. There may be an implementation limit on
the number of open handles, which may be lower than the
limit on the number of open files - &quot;errno&quot; may
not be set when &quot;NULL&quot; is returned if this limit
is exceeded.</p>

<p>PerlIO_reopen(path,mode,f) While this currently exists
in all three implementations perl itself does not use it. As
perl does not use it, it is not well tested.</p>

<p>Perl prefers to &quot;dup&quot; the new low-level
descriptor to the descriptor used by the existing PerlIO.
This may become the behaviour of this function in the
future.</p>

<p>PerlIO_printf(f,fmt,...), PerlIO_vprintf(f,fmt,a) These
are fprintf()/vfprintf() equivalents.</p>

<p>PerlIO_stdoutf(fmt,...) This is printf() equivalent.
printf is #defined to this function, so it is (currently)
legal to use &quot;printf(fmt,...)&quot; in perl
sources.</p>

<p>PerlIO_read(f,buf,count), PerlIO_write(f,buf,count)
These correspond functionally to fread() and fwrite() but
the arguments and return values are different. The
PerlIO_read() and PerlIO_write() signatures have been
modeled on the more sane low level read() and write()
functions instead: The &quot;file&quot; argument is passed
first, there is only one &quot;count&quot;, and the return
value can distinguish between error and &quot;EOF&quot;.</p>

<p>Returns a byte count if successful (which may be zero or
positive), returns negative value and sets &quot;errno&quot;
on error. Depending on implementation &quot;errno&quot; may
be &quot;EINTR&quot; if operation was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>PerlIO_close(f) Depending on implementation
&quot;errno&quot; may be &quot;EINTR&quot; if operation was
interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>PerlIO_puts(f,s), PerlIO_putc(f,c) These correspond to
fputs() and fputc(). Note that arguments have been revised
to have &quot;file&quot; first.</p>

<p>PerlIO_ungetc(f,c) This corresponds to ungetc(). Note
that arguments have been revised to have &quot;file&quot;
first. Arranges that next read operation will return the
byte c. Despite the implied &quot;character&quot; in the
name only values in the range 0..0xFF are defined. Returns
the byte c on success or -1 (&quot;EOF&quot;) on error. The
number of bytes that can be &quot;pushed back&quot; may
vary, only 1 character is certain, and then only if it is
the last character that was read from the handle.</p>

<p>PerlIO_getc(f) This corresponds to getc(). Despite the c
in the name only byte range 0..0xFF is supported. Returns
the character read or -1 (&quot;EOF&quot;) on error.</p>

<p>PerlIO_eof(f) This corresponds to feof(). Returns a
true/false indication of whether the handle is at end of
file. For terminal devices this may or may not be
&quot;sticky&quot; depending on the implementation. The flag
is cleared by PerlIO_seek(), or PerlIO_rewind().</p>

<p>PerlIO_error(f) This corresponds to ferror(). Returns a
true/false indication of whether there has been an IO error
on the handle.</p>

<p>PerlIO_fileno(f) This corresponds to fileno(), note that
on some platforms, the meaning of &quot;fileno&quot; may not
match Unix. Returns -1 if the handle has no open descriptor
associated with it.</p>

<p>PerlIO_clearerr(f) This corresponds to clearerr(), i.e.,
clears error and (usually) eof flags for the
&quot;stream&quot;. Does not return a value.</p>

<p>PerlIO_flush(f) This corresponds to fflush(). Sends any
buffered write data to the underlying file. If called with
&quot;NULL&quot; this may flush all open streams (or core
dump with some USE_STDIO implementations). Calling on a
handle open for read only, or on which last operation was a
read of some kind may lead to undefined behaviour on some
USE_STDIO implementations. The USE_PERLIO (layers)
implementation tries to behave better: it flushes all open
streams when passed &quot;NULL&quot;, and attempts to retain
data on read streams either in the buffer or by seeking the
handle to the current logical position.</p>

<p>PerlIO_seek(f,offset,whence) This corresponds to
fseek(). Sends buffered write data to the underlying file,
or discards any buffered read data, then positions the file
descriptor as specified by offset and whence (sic). This is
the correct thing to do when switching between read and
write on the same handle (see issues with PerlIO_flush()
above). Offset is of type &quot;Off_t&quot; which is a perl
Configure value which may not be same as stdios
&quot;off_t&quot;.</p>

<p>PerlIO_tell(f) This corresponds to ftell(). Returns the
current file position, or (Off_t) -1 on error. May just
return value system &quot;knows&quot; without making a
system call or checking the underlying file descriptor (so
use on shared file descriptors is not safe without a
PerlIO_seek()). Return value is of type &quot;Off_t&quot;
which is a perl Configure value which may not be same as
stdio s &quot;off_t&quot;.</p>

<p>PerlIO_getpos(f,p), PerlIO_setpos(f,p) These correspond
(loosely) to fgetpos() and fsetpos(). Rather than stdios
Fpos_t they expect a &quot;Perl Scalar Value&quot; to be
passed. What is stored there should be considered opaque.
The layout of the data may vary from handle to handle. When
not using stdio or if platform does not have the stdio calls
then they are implemented in terms of PerlIO_tell() and
PerlIO_seek().</p>

<p>PerlIO_rewind(f) This corresponds to rewind(). It is
usually defined as being</p>

<p>PerlIO_seek(f,(Off_t)0L, SEEK_SET);
PerlIO_clearerr(f);</p>

<p>PerlIO_tmpfile() This corresponds to tmpfile(), i.e.,
returns an anonymous PerlIO or NULL on error. The system
will attempt to automatically delete the file when closed.
On Unix the file is usually &quot;unlink&quot;-ed just after
it is created so it does not matter how it gets closed. On
other systems the file may only be deleted if closed via
PerlIO_close() and/or the program exits via
&quot;exit&quot;. Depending on the implementation there may
be &quot;race conditions&quot; which allow other processes
access to the file, though in general it will be safer in
this regard than ad. hoc. schemes.</p>

<p>PerlIO_setlinebuf(f) This corresponds to setlinebuf().
Does not return a value. What constitutes a &quot;line&quot;
is implementation dependent but usually means that writing
&quot;0 flushes the buffer. What happens with things like
&quot;this0hat&quot; is uncertain. (Perl core uses it only
when &quot;dumping&quot;; it has nothing to do with $|
auto-flush.)</p>

<p>Co-existence with stdio There is outline support for
co-existence of PerlIO with stdio. Obviously if PerlIO is
implemented in terms of stdio there is no problem. However
in other cases then mechanisms must exist to create a FILE *
which can be passed to library code which is going to use
stdio calls.</p>

<p>The first step is to add this line:</p>

<p>#define PERLIO_NOT_STDIO 0</p>

<p>before including any perl header files. (This will
probably become the default at some point). That prevents
&quot;perlio.h&quot; from attempting to #define stdio
functions onto PerlIO functions.</p>

<p>XS code is probably better using &quot;typemap&quot; if
it expects FILE * arguments. The standard typemap will be
adjusted to comprehend any changes in this area.</p>

<p>PerlIO_importFILE(f,mode) Used to get a PerlIO * from a
FILE *.</p>

<p>The mode argument should be a string as would be passed
to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is NULL then - for legacy
support - the code will (depending upon the platform and the
implementation) either attempt to empirically determine the
mode in which f is open, or use &quot;r+&quot; to indicate a
read/write stream.</p>

<p>Once called the FILE * should ONLY be closed by calling
&quot;PerlIO_close()&quot; on the returned PerlIO *.</p>

<p>The PerlIO is set to textmode. Use PerlIO_binmode if
this is not the desired mode.</p>

<p>This is not the reverse of PerlIO_exportFILE().</p>

<p>PerlIO_exportFILE(f,mode) Given a PerlIO * create a
native FILE * suitable for passing to code expecting to be
compiled and linked with ANSI C stdio.h. The mode argument
should be a string as would be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open.
If it is NULL then - for legacy support - the FILE * is
opened in same mode as the PerlIO *.</p>

<p>The fact that such a FILE * has been exported is
recorded, (normally by pushing a new :stdio
&quot;layer&quot; onto the PerlIO *), which may affect
future PerlIO operations on the original PerlIO *. You
should not call &quot;fclose()&quot; on the file unless you
call &quot;PerlIO_releaseFILE()&quot; to disassociate it
from the PerlIO *. (Do not use PerlIO_importFILE() for doing
the disassociation.)</p>

<p>Calling this function repeatedly will create a FILE * on
each call (and will push an :stdio layer each time as
well).</p>

<p>PerlIO_releaseFILE(p,f) Calling PerlIO_releaseFILE
informs PerlIO that all use of FILE * is complete. It is
removed from the list of exported FILE *s, and the
associated PerlIO * should revert to its original
behaviour.</p>

<p>Use this to disassociate a file from a PerlIO * that was
associated using PerlIO_exportFILE().</p>

<p>PerlIO_findFILE(f) Returns a native FILE * used by a
stdio layer. If there is none, it will create one with
PerlIO_exportFILE. In either case the FILE * should be
considered as belonging to PerlIO subsystem and should only
be closed by calling &quot;PerlIO_close()&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Fast gets&quot; Functions In addition to
standard-like API defined so far above there is an
&quot;implementation&quot; interface which allows perl to
get at internals of PerlIO. The following calls correspond
to the various FILE_xxx macros determined by Configure - or
their equivalent in other implementations. This section is
really of interest to only those concerned with detailed
perl-core behaviour, implementing a PerlIO mapping or
writing code which can make use of the &quot;read
ahead&quot; that has been done by the IO system in the same
way perl does. Note that any code that uses these interfaces
must be prepared to do things the traditional way if a
handle does not support them.</p>

<p>PerlIO_fast_gets(f) Returns true if implementation has
all the interfaces required to allow perls
&quot;sv_gets&quot; to &quot;bypass&quot; normal IO
mechanism. This can vary from handle to handle.</p>

<p>PerlIO_fast_gets(f) = PerlIO_has_cntptr(f) &amp;&amp;
PerlIO_canset_cnt(f) &amp;&amp; &lsquo;Can set pointer into
buffer&rsquo;</p>

<p>PerlIO_has_cntptr(f) Implementation can return pointer
to current position in the &quot;buffer&quot; and a count of
bytes available in the buffer. Do not use this - use
PerlIO_fast_gets.</p>

<p>PerlIO_get_cnt(f) Return count of readable bytes in the
buffer. Zero or negative return means no more bytes
available.</p>

<p>PerlIO_get_ptr(f) Return pointer to next readable byte
in buffer, accessing via the pointer (dereferencing) is only
safe if PerlIO_get_cnt() has returned a positive value. Only
positive offsets up to value returned by PerlIO_get_cnt()
are allowed.</p>

<p>PerlIO_set_ptrcnt(f,p,c) Set pointer into buffer, and a
count of bytes still in the buffer. Should be used only to
set pointer to within range implied by previous calls to
&quot;PerlIO_get_ptr&quot; and &quot;PerlIO_get_cnt&quot;.
The two values must be consistent with each other
(implementation may only use one or the other or may require
both).</p>

<p>PerlIO_canset_cnt(f) Implementation can adjust its idea
of number of bytes in the buffer. Do not use this - use
PerlIO_fast_gets.</p>

<p>PerlIO_set_cnt(f,c) Obscure - set count of bytes in the
buffer. Deprecated. Only usable if PerlIO_canset_cnt()
returns true. Currently used in only doio.c to force count
less than -1 to -1. Perhaps should be PerlIO_set_empty or
similar. This call may actually do nothing if
&quot;count&quot; is deduced from pointer and a
&quot;limit&quot;. Do not use this - use
PerlIO_set_ptrcnt().</p>

<p>PerlIO_has_base(f) Returns true if implementation has a
buffer, and can return pointer to whole buffer and its size.
Used by perl for -T / -B tests. Other uses would be very
obscure...</p>

<p>PerlIO_get_base(f) Return start of buffer. Access only
positive offsets in the buffer up to the value returned by
PerlIO_get_bufsiz().</p>

<p>PerlIO_get_bufsiz(f) Return the total number of bytes in
the buffer, this is neither the number that can be read, nor
the amount of memory allocated to the buffer. Rather it is
what the operating system and/or implementation happened to
&quot;read()&quot; (or whatever) last time IO was
requested.</p>

<p>Other Functions PerlIO_apply_layers(f,mode,layers) The
new interface to the USE_PERLIO implementation. The layers
&quot;:crlf&quot; and &quot;:raw&quot; are only ones allowed
for other implementations and those are silently ignored.
(As of perl5.8 &quot;:raw&quot; is deprecated.) Use
PerlIO_binmode() below for the portable case.</p>

<p>PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,imode,layers) The hook used by
perls &quot;binmode&quot; operator. ptype is perls character
for the kind of IO:</p>

<p>&lt; read &gt; write + read/write</p>

<p>imode is &quot;O_BINARY&quot; or &quot;O_TEXT&quot;.</p>

<p>layers is a string of layers to apply, only
&quot;:crlf&quot; makes sense in the non USE_PERLIO case.
(As of perl5.8 &quot;:raw&quot; is deprecated in favour of
passing NULL.)</p>

<p>Portable cases are:</p>

<p>PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,O_BINARY,NULL); and
PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,O_TEXT,&quot;:crlf&quot;);</p>

<p>On Unix these calls probably have no effect whatsoever.
Elsewhere they alter &quot;0 to CR,LF translation and
possibly cause a special text &quot;end of file&quot;
indicator to be written or honoured on read. The effect of
making the call after doing any IO to the handle depends on
the implementation. (It may be ignored, affect any data
which is already buffered as well, or only apply to
subsequent data.)</p>

<p>PerlIO_debug(fmt,...) PerlIO_debug is a printf()-like
function which can be used for debugging. No return value.
Its main use is inside PerlIO where using real printf,
warn() etc. would recursively call PerlIO and be a
problem.</p>

<p>PerlIO_debug writes to the file named by $ENV{
PERLIO_DEBUG} typical use might be</p>

<p>Bourne shells (sh, ksh, bash, zsh, ash, ...):
PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty ./perl somescript some args</p>

<p>Csh/Tcsh: setenv PERLIO_DEBUG /dev/tty ./perl somescript
some args</p>

<p>If you have the &quot;env&quot; utility: env
PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty ./perl somescript some args</p>

<p>Win32: set PERLIO_DEBUG=CON perl somescript some
args</p>

<p>If $ENV{PERLIO_DEBUG} is not set PerlIO_debug() is a
no-op.</p>
