<p>NAME pgmcrater - create cratered terrain by fractal
forgery</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmcrater</p>

<p>[-number n]</p>

<p>[-height|-ysize s]</p>

<p>[-width|-xsize s]</p>

<p>[-gamma g]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmcrater creates a PGM image which mimics cratered
terrain. The PGM image is created by simulating the impact
of a given number of craters with random position and size,
then rendering the resulting terrain elevations based on a
light source shining from one side of the screen. The size
distribution of the craters is based on a power law which
results in many more small craters than large ones. The
number of craters of a given size varies as the reciprocal
of the area as described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and
Saupe[1]; cratered bodies in the Solar System are observed
to obey this relationship. The for- mula used to obtain
crater radii governed by this law from a uniformly
distributed pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy
Rucker.</p>

<p>High resolution images with large numbers of craters
often benefit from being piped through pnmsmooth. The
averaging performed by this process eliminates some of the
jagged pixels and lends a mellow telescopic image feel to
the overall picture.</p>

<p>pgmcrater simulates only small craters, which are
hemispherical in shape (regardless of the incidence angle of
the impacting body, as long as the velocity is sufficiently
high). Large craters, such as Coperni- cus and Tycho on the
Moon, have a walled plain shape with a cross- section more
like:</p>

<p>/ / _____/ ____________/____________/ _____</p>

<p>Larger craters should really use this profile, including
the central peak, and totally obliterate the pre-existing
terrain.</p>

<p>The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm
10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the
same second, you may get identical output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-number n Causes n craters to be generated. If no
-number specification is given, 50000 craters will be
generated. Don t expect to see them all! For every large
crater there are many, many more tiny ones which tend simply
to erode the landscape. In general, the more craters you
specify the more realistic the result; ideally you want the
entire terrain to have been extensively turned over again
and again by cratering. High resolution images containing
five to ten million craters are stunning but take quite a
while to create.</p>

<p>-height height Sets the height of the generated image to
height pixels. The default height is 256 pixels.</p>

<p>-width width Sets the width of the generated image to
width pixels. The default width is 256 pixels.</p>

<p>-xsize width Sets the width of the generated image to
width pixels. The default width is 256 pixels.</p>

<p>-ysize height Sets the height of the generated image to
height pixels. The default height is 256 pixels.</p>

<p>-gamma factor The specified factor is used to gamma
adjust the image in the same manner as performed by
pnmgamma. The default value is 1.0, which results in a
medium contrast image. Values larger than 1 lighten the
image and reduce contrast, while values less than 1 darken
the image, increasing contrast.</p>

<p>Note that this is separate from the gamma correction
that is part of the definition of the PGM format. The image
pnmgamma generates is a genuine, gamma-corrected PGM image
in any case. This option simply changes the contrast and may
compensate for a display device that does not correctly
render PGM images.</p>

<p>DESIGN NOTES The-gamma option isnt really necessary
since you can achieve the same effect by piping the output
from pgmcrater through pnmgamma. However, pgmcrater performs
an internal gamma map anyway in the process of ren- dering
the elevation array into the PGM format, so there s no addi-
tional overhead in allowing an additional gamma
adjustment.</p>

<p>Real craters have two distinct morphologies.</p>
