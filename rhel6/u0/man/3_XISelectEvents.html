<p>XISELECTEVENTS(3) [FIXME: manual] XISELECTEVENTS(3)</p>

<p>NAME XISelectEvents, XIGetSelectedEvents - select for or
get selected XI2 events on the window.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XISelectEvents( Display *display, Window win,
XIEventMask *masks, int num_masks);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>masks Device event mask.</p>

<p>num_masks Number of masks in masks.</p>

<p>win Specifies the window.</p>

<p>XIEventMask *XIGetSelectedEvents( Display *display,
Window win, int *num_masks_return);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>num_masks_return Number of masks in the return
value.</p>

<p>win Specifies the window.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XI2 events must be selected using
XISelectEvents.</p>

<p>XISelectEvents sets the event mask for this client on
win. Further events are only reported to this client if the
event type matches the selected event mask. The masks
overrides the previously selected event mask for the given
device.</p>

<p>If deviceid is a valid device, the event mask is
selected only for this device. If deviceid is XIAllDevices
or XIAllMasterDevices, the event mask is selected for all
devices or all master devices, respectively. The effective
event mask is the bit-wise OR of the XIAllDevices,
XIAllMasterDevices and the respective device&acute;s event
mask.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int deviceid; int mask_len; unsigned
char* mask; } XIEventMask;</p>

<p>The mask_len specifies the length of mask in bytes. mask
is a binary mask in the form of (1 &lt;&lt; event type).
deviceid must be either a device or XIAllDevices or
XIAllMasterDevices. A client may submit several masks with
the same deviceid in one request but only the last mask will
be effective.</p>

<p>XISelectEvents can generate a BadValue, a BadDevice, and
a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>XIGetSelectedEvents returns the events selected by this
client on the given window. If no events were selected on
this window, XIGetSelectedEvents returns NULL and
num_masks_return is set to 0. If an internal error occurs,
XIGetSelectedEvents returns NULL and num_masks_return is set
to -1. Otherwise, XIGetSelectedEvent returns the selected
event masks for all devices including the masks for
XIAllDevices and XIAllMasterDevices</p>

<p>The caller must free the returned data using
XFree().</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue A value is outside of the permitted
range.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined window.</p>

<p>BadDevice An invalid device was specified. The device
does not exist.</p>
