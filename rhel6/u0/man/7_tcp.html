<p>NAME tcp - TCP protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt; #include &lt;netinet/tcp.h&gt;</p>

<p>tcp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is an implementation of the TCP
protocol defined in RFC 793, RFC 1122 and RFC 2001 with the
NewReno and SACK extensions. It pro- vides a reliable,
stream-oriented, full-duplex connection between two sockets
on top of ip(7), for both v4 and v6 versions. TCP guarantees
that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost packets.
It gener- ates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch
transmission errors. TCP does not preserve record
boundaries.</p>

<p>A newly created TCP socket has no remote or local
address and is not fully specified. To create an outgoing
TCP connection use connect(2) to establish a connection to
another TCP socket. To receive new incom- ing connections,
first bind(2) the socket to a local address and port and
then call listen(2) to put the socket into the listening
state. After that a new socket for each incoming connection
can be accepted using accept(2). A socket which has had
accept(2) or connect(2) suc- cessfully called on it is fully
specified and may transmit data. Data cannot be transmitted
on listening or not yet connected sockets.</p>

<p>Linux supports RFC 1323 TCP high performance extensions.
These include Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers
(PAWS), Window Scaling and Timestamps. Window scaling allows
the use of large (&gt; 64K) TCP windows in order to support
links with high latency or bandwidth. To make use of them,
the send and receive buffer sizes must be increased. They
can be set globally with the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem and
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem files, or on individual sockets
by using the SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF socket options with the
setsockopt(2) call.</p>

<p>The maximum sizes for socket buffers declared via the
SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF mechanisms are limited by the values
in the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max and
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max files. Note that TCP actually
allocates twice the size of the buffer requested in the
setsockopt(2) call, and so a succeeding getsockopt(2) call
will not return the same size of buffer as requested in the
setsockopt(2) call. TCP uses the extra space for
administrative purposes and inter- nal kernel structures,
and the /proc file values reflect the larger sizes compared
to the actual TCP windows. On individual connections, the
socket buffer size must be set prior to the listen(2) or
connect(2) calls in order to have it take effect. See
socket(7) for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>TCP supports urgent data. Urgent data is used to signal
the receiver that some important message is part of the data
stream and that it should be processed as soon as possible.
To send urgent data specify the MSG_OOB option to send(2).
When urgent data is received, the ker- nel sends a SIGURG
signal to the process or process group that has been set as
the socket &quot;owner&quot; using the SIOCSPGRP or
FIOSETOWN ioctls (or the POSIX.1-2001-specified fcntl(2)
F_SETOWN operation). When the SO_OOBINLINE socket option is
enabled, urgent data is put into the nor- mal data stream (a
program can test for its location using the SIOCAT- MARK
ioctl described below), otherwise it can be only received
when the MSG_OOB flag is set for recv(2) or recvmsg(2).</p>

<p>Linux 2.4 introduced a number of changes for improved
throughput and scaling, as well as enhanced functionality.
Some of these features include support for zero-copy
sendfile(2), Explicit Congestion Notifi- cation, new
management of TIME_WAIT sockets, keep-alive socket options
and support for Duplicate SACK extensions.</p>

<p>Address Formats TCP is built on top of IP (see ip(7)).
The address formats defined by ip(7) apply to TCP. TCP only
supports point-to-point communication; broadcasting and
multicasting are not supported.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces System-wide TCP parameter settings can
be accessed by files in the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/.
In addition, most IP /proc interfaces also apply to TCP; see
ip(7). Variables described as Boolean take an integer value,
with a non-zero value (&quot;true&quot;) meaning that the
corre- sponding option is enabled, and a zero value
(&quot;false&quot;) meaning that the option is disabled.</p>

<p>tcp_abc (Integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.15)
Controls the Appropriate Byte Count (ABC), defined in RFC
3465. ABC is a way of increasing the congestion window
(cwnd) more slowly in response to partial acknowledgments.
Possible values are:</p>

<p>0 increase cwnd once per acknowledgment (no ABC)</p>

<p>1 increase cwnd once per acknowledgment of full sized
segment</p>

<p>2 allow increase cwnd by two if acknowledgment is of two
seg- ments to compensate for delayed acknowledgments.</p>

<p>tcp_abort_on_overflow (Boolean; default: disabled; since
Linux 2.4) Enable resetting connections if the listening
service is too slow and unable to keep up and accept them.
It means that if overflow occurred due to a burst, the
connection will recover. Enable this option only if you are
really sure that the listen- ing daemon cannot be tuned to
accept connections faster. Enabling this option can harm the
clients of your server.</p>

<p>tcp_adv_win_scale (integer; default: 2; since Linux 2.4)
Count buffering overhead as bytes/2^tcp_adv_win_scale, if
tcp_adv_win_scale is greater than 0; or bytes-
bytes/2^(-tcp_adv_win_scale), if tcp_adv_win_scale is less
than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>The socket receive buffer space is shared between the
applica- tion and kernel. TCP maintains part of the buffer
as the TCP window, this is the size of the receive window
advertised to the other end. The rest of the space is used
as the &quot;application&quot; buffer, used to isolate the
network from scheduling and applica- tion latencies. The
tcp_adv_win_scale default value of 2 implies that the space
used for the application buffer is one fourth that of the
total.</p>

<p>tcp_allowed_congestion_control (String; default: see
text; since Linux 2.4.20) Show/set the congestion control
choices available to non-privi- leged processes (see the
description of the TCP_CONGESTION socket option). The list
is a subset of those listed in
tcp_available_congestion_control. The default value for this
list is &quot;reno&quot; plus the default setting of
tcp_congestion_con- trol.</p>

<p>tcp_available_congestion_control (String; read-only;
since Linux 2.4.20) Shows a list of the congestion-control
algorithms that are registered. This list is a limiting set
for the list in tcp_allowed_congestion_control. More
congestion-control algo- rithms may be available as modules,
but not loaded.</p>

<p>tcp_app_win (integer; default: 31; since Linux 2.4) This
variable defines how many bytes of the TCP window are
reserved for buffering overhead.</p>

<p>A maximum of (window/2^tcp_app_win, mss) bytes in the
window are reserved for the application buffer. A value of 0
implies that no amount is reserved.</p>

<p>tcp_base_mss (Integer; default: 512; since Linux 2.6.17)
The initial value of search_low to be used by the
packetization layer Path MTU discovery (MTU probing). If MTU
probing is enabled, this is the initial MSS used by the
connection.</p>

<p>tcp_bic (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6
to 2.6.13) Enable BIC TCP congestion control algorithm.
BIC-TCP is a sender-side only change that ensures a linear
RTT fairness under large windows while offering both
scalability and bounded TCP- friendliness. The protocol
combines two schemes called additive increase and binary
search increase. When the congestion window is large,
additive increase with a large increment ensures lin- ear
RTT fairness as well as good scalability. Under small con-
gestion windows, binary search increase provides TCP
friendli- ness.</p>

<p>tcp_bic_low_window (integer; default: 14; Linux
2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13) Sets the threshold window (in
packets) where BIC TCP starts to adjust the congestion
window. Below this threshold BIC TCP behaves the same as the
default TCP Reno.</p>

<p>tcp_bic_fast_convergence (Boolean; default: enabled;
Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13) Forces BIC TCP to more quickly
respond to changes in congestion window. Allows two flows
sharing the same connection to con- verge more rapidly.</p>

<p>tcp_congestion_control (String; default: enabled; since
Linux 2.4.13) Set the default congestion-control algorithm
to be used for new connections. The algorithm
&quot;reno&quot; is always available, but additional choices
may be available depending on kernel configu- ration. The
default value for this file is set as part of ker- nel
configuration.</p>

<p>tcp_dma_copybreak (integer; default: 4096; since Linux
2.6.24) Lower limit, in bytes, of the size of socket reads
that will be offloaded to a DMA copy engine, if one is
present in the system and the kernel was configured with the
CONFIG_NET_DMA option.</p>

<p>tcp_dsack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.4)
Enable RFC 2883 TCP Duplicate SACK support.</p>

<p>tcp_ecn (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
Enable RFC 2884 Explicit Congestion Notification. When
enabled, connectivity to some destinations could be affected
due to older, misbehaving routers along the path causing
connections to be dropped.</p>

<p>tcp_fack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
Enable TCP Forward Acknowledgement support.</p>

<p>tcp_fin_timeout (integer; default: 60; since Linux 2.2)
This specifies how many seconds to wait for a final FIN
packet before the socket is forcibly closed. This is
strictly a viola- tion of the TCP specification, but
required to prevent denial- of-service attacks. In Linux
2.2, the default value was 180.</p>

<p>tcp_frto (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)
Enables F-RTO, an enhanced recovery algorithm for TCP
retrans- mission timeouts (RTOs). It is particularly
beneficial in wire- less environments where packet loss is
typically due to random radio interference rather than
intermediate router congestion. See RFC 4138 for more
details.</p>

<p>This file can have one of the following values:</p>

<p>0 Disabled.</p>

<p>1 The basic version F-RTO algorithm is enabled.</p>

<p>2 Enable SACK-enhanced F-RTO if flow uses SACK. The
basic ver- sion can be used also when SACK is in use though
in that case scenario(s) exists where F-RTO interacts badly
with the packet counting of the SACK-enabled TCP flow.</p>

<p>Before Linux 2.6.22, this parameter was a Boolean value,
sup- porting just values 0 and 1 above.</p>

<p>tcp_frto_response (integer; default: 0; since Linux
2.6.22) When F-RTO has detected that a TCP retransmission
timeout was spurious (i.e, the timeout would have been
avoided had TCP set a longer retransmission timeout), TCP
has several options concern- ing what to do next. Possible
values are:</p>

<p>0 Rate halving based; a smooth and conservative
response, results in halved congestion window (cwnd) and
slow-start threshold (ssthresh) after one RTT.</p>

<p>1 Very conservative response; not recommended because
even though being valid, it interacts poorly with the rest
of Linux TCP; halves cwnd and ssthresh immediately.</p>

<p>2 Aggressive response; undoes congestion-control
measures that are now known to be unnecessary (ignoring the
possibility of a lost retransmission that would require TCP
to be more cau- tious); cwnd and ssthresh are restored to
the values prior to timeout.</p>

<p>tcp_keepalive_intvl (integer; default: 75; since Linux
2.4) The number of seconds between TCP keep-alive
probes.</p>

<p>tcp_keepalive_probes (integer; default: 9; since Linux
2.2) The maximum number of TCP keep-alive probes to send
before giv- ing up and killing the connection if no response
is obtained from the other end.</p>

<p>tcp_keepalive_time (integer; default: 7200; since Linux
2.2) The number of seconds a connection needs to be idle
before TCP begins sending out keep-alive probes. Keep-alives
are only sent when the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is
enabled. The default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours). An
idle connection is termi- nated after approximately an
additional 11 minutes (9 probes an interval of 75 seconds
apart) when keep-alive is enabled.</p>

<p>Note that underlying connection tracking mechanisms and
applica- tion timeouts may be much shorter.</p>

<p>tcp_low_latency (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.4.21/2.6) If enabled, the TCP stack makes decisions that
prefer lower latency as opposed to higher throughput. It
this option is dis- abled, then higher throughput is
preferred. An example of an application where this default
should be changed would be a Beowulf compute cluster.</p>

<p>tcp_max_orphans (integer; default: see below; since
Linux 2.4) The maximum number of orphaned (not attached to
any user file handle) TCP sockets allowed in the system.
When this number is exceeded, the orphaned connection is
reset and a warning is printed. This limit exists only to
prevent simple denial-of- service attacks. Lowering this
limit is not recommended. Net- work conditions might require
you to increase the number of orphans allowed, but note that
each orphan can eat up to ~64K of unswappable memory. The
default initial value is set equal to the kernel parameter
NR_FILE. This initial default is adjusted depending on the
memory in the system.</p>

<p>tcp_max_syn_backlog (integer; default: see below; since
Linux 2.2) The maximum number of queued connection requests
which have still not received an acknowledgement from the
connecting client. If this number is exceeded, the kernel
will begin drop- ping requests. The default value of 256 is
increased to 1024 when the memory present in the system is
adequate or greater (&gt;= 128Mb), and reduced to 128 for
those systems with very low mem- ory (&lt;= 32Mb). It is
recommended that if this needs to be increased above 1024,
TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE in include/net/tcp.h be modified to keep
TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16&lt;=tcp_max_syn_backlog, and the kernel be
recompiled.</p>

<p>tcp_max_tw_buckets (integer; default: see below; since
Linux 2.4) The maximum number of sockets in TIME_WAIT state
allowed in the system. This limit exists only to prevent
simple denial-of-ser- vice attacks. The default value of
NR_FILE*2 is adjusted depending on the memory in the system.
If this number is exceeded, the socket is closed and a
warning is printed.</p>

<p>tcp_moderate_rcvbuf (Boolean; default: enabled; since
Linux 2.4.17/2.6.7) If enabled, TCP performs receive buffer
auto-tuning, attempting to automatically size the buffer (no
greater than tcp_rmem[2]) to match the size required by the
path for full throughput.</p>

<p>tcp_mem (since Linux 2.4) This is a vector of 3
integers: [low, pressure, high]. These bounds, measured in
units of the system page size, are used by TCP to track its
memory usage. The defaults are calculated at boot time from
the amount of available memory. (TCP can only use low memory
for this, which is limited to around 900 megabytes on 32-bit
systems. 64-bit systems do not suffer this limitation.)</p>

<p>low TCP doesn t regulate its memory allocation when the
number of pages it has allocated globally is below this
number.</p>

<p>pressure When the amount of memory allocated by TCP
exceeds this number of pages, TCP moderates its memory con-
sumption. This memory pressure state is exited once the
number of pages allocated falls below the low mark.</p>

<p>high The maximum number of pages, globally, that TCP
will allocate. This value overrides any other limits imposed
by the kernel.</p>

<p>tcp_mtu_probing (integer; default: 0; since Linux
2.6.17) This parameter controls TCP Packetization-Layer Path
MTU Discov- ery. The following values may be assigned to the
file:</p>

<p>0 Disabled</p>

<p>1 Disabled by default, enabled when an ICMP black hole
detected</p>

<p>2 Always enabled, use initial MSS of tcp_base_mss.</p>

<p>tcp_no_metrics_save (Boolean; default: disabled; since
Linux 2.6.6) By default, TCP saves various connection
metrics in the route cache when the connection closes, so
that connections estab- lished in the near future can use
these to set initial condi- tions. Usually, this increases
overall performance, but it may sometimes cause performance
degradation. If tcp_no_metrics_save is enabled, TCP will not
cache metrics on closing connections.</p>

<p>tcp_orphan_retries (integer; default: 8; since Linux
2.4) The maximum number of attempts made to probe the other
end of a connection which has been closed by our end.</p>

<p>tcp_reordering (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.4)
The maximum a packet can be reordered in a TCP packet stream
without TCP assuming packet loss and going into slow start.
It is not advisable to change this number. This is a packet
reordering detection metric designed to minimize unnecessary
back off and retransmits provoked by reordering of packets
on a connection.</p>

<p>tcp_retrans_collapse (Boolean; default: enabled; since
Linux 2.2) Try to send full-sized packets during
retransmit.</p>

<p>tcp_retries1 (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.2) The
number of times TCP will attempt to retransmit a packet on
an established connection normally, without the extra effort
of getting the network layers involved. Once we exceed this
number of retransmits, we first have the network layer
update the route if possible before each new retransmit. The
default is the RFC specified minimum of 3.</p>

<p>tcp_retries2 (integer; default: 15; since Linux 2.2) The
maximum number of times a TCP packet is retransmitted in
established state before giving up. The default value is 15,
which corresponds to a duration of approximately between 13
to 30 minutes, depending on the retransmission timeout. The
RFC 1122 specified minimum limit of 100 seconds is typically
deemed too short.</p>

<p>tcp_rfc1337 (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.2) Enable TCP behavior conformant with RFC 1337. When
disabled, if a RST is received in TIME_WAIT state, we close
the socket imme- diately without waiting for the end of the
TIME_WAIT period.</p>

<p>tcp_rmem (since Linux 2.4) This is a vector of 3
integers: [min, default, max]. These parameters are used by
TCP to regulate receive buffer sizes. TCP dynamically
adjusts the size of the receive buffer from the defaults
listed below, in the range of these values, depending on
memory available in the system.</p>

<p>min minimum size of the receive buffer used by each TCP
socket. The default value is the system page size. (On Linux
2.4, the default value is 4K, lowered to PAGE_SIZE bytes in
low-memory systems.) This value is used to ensure that in
memory pressure mode, alloca- tions below this size will
still succeed. This is not used to bound the size of the
receive buffer declared using SO_RCVBUF on a socket.</p>

<p>default the default size of the receive buffer for a TCP
socket. This value overwrites the initial default buffer
size from the generic global net.core.rmem_default defined
for all protocols. The default value is 87380 bytes. (On
Linux 2.4, this will be lowered to 43689 in low-memory
systems.) If larger receive buffer sizes are desired, this
value should be increased (to affect all sockets). To employ
large TCP windows, the net.ipv4.tcp_win- dow_scaling must be
enabled (default).</p>

<p>max the maximum size of the receive buffer used by each
TCP socket. This value does not override the global
net.core.rmem_max. This is not used to limit the size of the
receive buffer declared using SO_RCVBUF on a socket. The
default value is calculated using the formula</p>

<p>max(87380, min(4MB, tcp_mem[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))</p>

<p>(On Linux 2.4, the default is 87380*2 bytes, lowered to
87380 in low-memory systems).</p>

<p>tcp_sack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
Enable RFC 2018 TCP Selective Acknowledgements.</p>

<p>tcp_slow_start_after_idle (Boolean; default: enabled;
since Linux 2.6.18) If enabled, provide RFC 2861 behavior
and time out the conges- tion window after an idle period.
An idle period is defined as the current RTO (retransmission
timeout). If disabled, the con- gestion window will not be
timed out after an idle period.</p>

<p>tcp_stdurg (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
If this option is enabled, then use the RFC 1122
interpretation of the TCP urgent-pointer field. According to
this interpreta- tion, the urgent pointer points to the last
byte of urgent data. If this option is disabled, then use
the BSD-compatible inter- pretation of the urgent pointer:
the urgent pointer points to the first byte after the urgent
data. Enabling this option may lead to interoperability
problems.</p>

<p>tcp_syn_retries (integer; default: 5; since Linux 2.2)
The maximum number of times initial SYNs for an active TCP
con- nection attempt will be retransmitted. This value
should not be higher than 255. The default value is 5, which
corresponds to approximately 180 seconds.</p>

<p>tcp_synack_retries (integer; default: 5; since Linux
2.2) The maximum number of times a SYN/ACK segment for a
passive TCP connection will be retransmitted. This number
should not be higher than 255.</p>

<p>tcp_syncookies (Boolean; since Linux 2.2) Enable TCP
syncookies. The kernel must be compiled with CON-
FIG_SYN_COOKIES. Send out syncookies when the syn backlog
queue of a socket overflows. The syncookies feature attempts
to pro- tect a socket from a SYN flood attack. This should
be used as a last resort, if at all. This is a violation of
the TCP proto- col, and conflicts with other areas of TCP
such as TCP exten- sions. It can cause problems for clients
and relays. It is not recommended as a tuning mechanism for
heavily loaded servers to help with overloaded or
misconfigured conditions. For recom- mended alternatives see
tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_synack_retries, and
tcp_abort_on_overflow.</p>

<p>tcp_timestamps (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux
2.2) Enable RFC 1323 TCP timestamps.</p>

<p>tcp_tso_win_divisor (integer; default: 3; since Linux
2.6.9) This parameter controls what percentage of the
congestion window can be consumed by a single TCP
Segmentation Offload (TSO) frame. The setting of this
parameter is a tradeoff between burstiness and building
larger TSO frames.</p>

<p>tcp_tw_recycle (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.4) Enable fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets. Enabling
this option is not recommended since this causes problems
when work- ing with NAT (Network Address Translation).</p>

<p>tcp_tw_reuse (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.4.19/2.6) Allow to reuse TIME_WAIT sockets for new
connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint. It
should not be changed without advice/request of technical
experts.</p>

<p>tcp_vegas_cong_avoid (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux
2.2 to 2.6.13) Enable TCP Vegas congestion avoidance
algorithm. TCP Vegas is a sender-side only change to TCP
that anticipates the onset of congestion by estimating the
bandwidth. TCP Vegas adjusts the sending rate by modifying
the congestion window. TCP Vegas should provide less packet
loss, but it is not as aggressive as TCP Reno.</p>

<p>tcp_westwood (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux
2.4.26/2.6.3 to 2.6.13) Enable TCP Westwood+ congestion
control algorithm. TCP West- wood+ is a sender-side only
modification of the TCP Reno proto- col stack that optimizes
the performance of TCP congestion con- trol. It is based on
end-to-end bandwidth estimation to set congestion window and
slow start threshold after a congestion episode. Using this
estimation, TCP Westwood+ adaptively sets a slow start
threshold and a congestion window which takes into account
the bandwidth used at the time congestion is experi- enced.
TCP Westwood+ significantly increases fairness with respect
to TCP Reno in wired networks and throughput over wire- less
links.</p>

<p>tcp_window_scaling (Boolean; default: enabled; since
Linux 2.2) Enable RFC 1323 TCP window scaling. This feature
allows the use of a large window (&gt; 64K) on a TCP
connection, should the other end support it. Normally, the
16 bit window length field in the TCP header limits the
window size to less than 64K bytes. If larger windows are
desired, applications can increase the size of their socket
buffers and the window scaling option will be employed. If
tcp_window_scaling is disabled, TCP will not nego- tiate the
use of window scaling with the other end during con- nection
setup.</p>

<p>tcp_wmem (since Linux 2.4) This is a vector of 3
integers: [min, default, max]. These parameters are used by
TCP to regulate send buffer sizes. TCP dynamically adjusts
the size of the send buffer from the default values listed
below, in the range of these values, depending on memory
available.</p>

<p>min Minimum size of the send buffer used by each TCP
socket. The default value is the system page size. (On Linux
2.4, the default value is 4K bytes.) This value is used to
ensure that in memory pressure mode, allocations below this
size will still succeed. This is not used to bound the size
of the send buffer declared using SO_SNDBUF on a socket.</p>

<p>default The default size of the send buffer for a TCP
socket. This value overwrites the initial default buffer
size from the generic global net.core.wmem_default defined
for all protocols. The default value is 16K bytes. If larger
send buffer sizes are desired, this value should be
increased (to affect all sockets). To employ large TCP
windows, the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling must be
set to a non-zero value (default).</p>

<p>max The maximum size of the send buffer used by each TCP
socket. This value does not override the value in
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max. This is not used to limit the
size of the send buffer declared using SO_SNDBUF on a
socket. The default value is calcu- lated using the
formula</p>

<p>max(65536, min(4MB, tcp_mem[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))</p>

<p>(On Linux 2.4, the default value is 128K bytes, low-
ered 64K depending on low-memory systems.)</p>

<p>tcp_workaround_signed_windows (Boolean; default:
disabled; since Linux 2.6.26) If enabled, assume that no
receipt of a window-scaling option means that the remote TCP
is broken and treats the window as a signed quantity. If
disabled, assume that the remote TCP is not broken even if
we do not receive a window scaling option from it.</p>

<p>Socket Options To set or get a TCP socket option, call
getsockopt(2) to read or set- sockopt(2) to write the option
with the option level argument set to IPPROTO_TCP. In
addition, most IPPROTO_IP socket options are valid on TCP
sockets. For more information see ip(7).</p>

<p>TCP_CORK (since Linux 2.2) If set, dont send out partial
frames. All queued partial frames are sent when the option
is cleared again. This is use- ful for prepending headers
before calling sendfile(2), or for throughput optimization.
As currently implemented, there is a 200 millisecond ceiling
on the time for which output is corked by TCP_CORK. If this
ceiling is reached, then queued data is automatically
transmitted. This option can be combined with TCP_NODELAY
only since Linux 2.5.71. This option should not be used in
code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT (since Linux 2.4) Allows a listener to
be awakened only when data arrives on the socket. Takes an
integer value (seconds), this can bound the maximum number
of attempts TCP will make to complete the connec- tion. This
option should not be used in code intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>TCP_INFO (since Linux 2.4) Used to collect information
about this socket. The kernel returns a struct tcp_info as
defined in the file /usr/include/linux/tcp.h. This option
should not be used in code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_KEEPCNT (since Linux 2.4) The maximum number of
keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the
connection. This option should not be used in code intended
to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_KEEPIDLE (since Linux 2.4) The time (in seconds) the
connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending
keepalive probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been
set on this socket. This option should not be used in code
intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_KEEPINTVL (since Linux 2.4) The time (in seconds)
between individual keepalive probes. This option should not
be used in code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_LINGER2 (since Linux 2.4) The lifetime of orphaned
FIN_WAIT2 state sockets. This option can be used to override
the system-wide setting in the file
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout for this socket. This is
not to be confused with the socket(7) level option
SO_LINGER. This option should not be used in code intended
to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_MAXSEG The maximum segment size for outgoing TCP
packets. If this option is set before connection
establishment, it also changes the MSS value announced to
the other end in the initial packet. Values greater than the
(eventual) interface MTU have no effect. TCP will also
impose its minimum and maximum bounds over the value
provided.</p>

<p>TCP_NODELAY If set, disable the Nagle algorithm. This
means that segments are always sent as soon as possible,
even if there is only a small amount of data. When not set,
data is buffered until there is a sufficient amount to send
out, thereby avoiding the frequent sending of small packets,
which results in poor uti- lization of the network. This
option is overridden by TCP_CORK; however, setting this
option forces an explicit flush of pending output, even if
TCP_CORK is currently set.</p>

<p>TCP_QUICKACK (since Linux 2.4.4) Enable quickack mode if
set or disable quickack mode if cleared. In quickack mode,
acks are sent immediately, rather than delayed if needed in
accordance to normal TCP operation. This flag is not
permanent, it only enables a switch to or from quickack
mode. Subsequent operation of the TCP protocol will once
again enter/leave quickack mode depending on internal
protocol pro- cessing and factors such as delayed ack
timeouts occurring and data transfer. This option should not
be used in code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_SYNCNT (since Linux 2.4) Set the number of SYN
retransmits that TCP should send before aborting the attempt
to connect. It cannot exceed 255. This option should not be
used in code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>TCP_WINDOW_CLAMP (since Linux 2.4) Bound the size of the
advertised window to this value. The ker- nel imposes a
minimum size of SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF/2. This option should not be
used in code intended to be portable.</p>

<p>Sockets API TCP provides limited support for out-of-band
data, in the form of (a single byte of) urgent data. In
Linux this means if the other end sends newer out-of-band
data the older urgent data is inserted as nor- mal data into
the stream (even when SO_OOBINLINE is not set). This differs
from BSD-based stacks.</p>

<p>Linux uses the BSD compatible interpretation of the
urgent pointer field by default. This violates RFC 1122, but
is required for interop- erability with other stacks. It can
be changed via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_stdurg.</p>

<p>It is possible to peek at out-of-band data using the
recv(2) MSG_PEEK flag.</p>

<p>Since version 2.4, Linux supports the use of MSG_TRUNC
in the flags argument of recv(2) (and recvmsg(2)). This flag
causes the received bytes of data to be discarded, rather
than passed back in a caller-sup- plied buffer. Since Linux
2.4.4, MSG_PEEK also has this effect when used in
conjunction with MSG_OOB to receive out-of-band data.</p>

<p>Ioctls These following ioctl(2) calls return information
in value. The cor- rect syntax is:</p>

<p>int value; error = ioctl(tcp_socket, ioctl_type,
&amp;value);</p>

<p>ioctl_type is one of the following:</p>

<p>SIOCINQ Returns the amount of queued unread data in the
receive buffer. The socket must not be in LISTEN state,
otherwise an error (EIN- VAL) is returned.</p>

<p>SIOCATMARK Returns true (i.e., value is non-zero) if the
inbound data stream is at the urgent mark.</p>

<p>If the SO_OOBINLINE socket option is set, and SIOCATMARK
returns true, then the next read from the socket will return
the urgent data. If the SO_OOBINLINE socket option is not
set, and SIOCAT- MARK returns true, then the next read from
the socket will return the bytes following the urgent data
(to actually read the urgent data requires the recv(MSG_OOB)
flag).</p>

<p>Note that a read never reads across the urgent mark. If
an application is informed of the presence of urgent data
via select(2) (using the exceptfds argument) or through
delivery of a SIGURG signal, then it can advance up to the
mark using a loop which repeatedly tests SIOCATMARK and
performs a read (request- ing any number of bytes) as long
as SIOCATMARK returns false.</p>

<p>SIOCOUTQ Returns the amount of unsent data in the socket
send queue. The socket must not be in LISTEN state,
otherwise an error (EINVAL) is returned.</p>

<p>Error Handling When a network error occurs, TCP tries to
resend the packet. If it doesnt succeed after some time,
either ETIMEDOUT or the last received error on this
connection is reported.</p>

<p>Some applications require a quicker error notification.
This can be enabled with the IPPROTO_IP level IP_RECVERR
socket option. When this option is enabled, all incoming
errors are immediately passed to the user program. Use this
option with care it makes TCP less tolerant to routing
changes and other normal network conditions.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAFNOTSUPPORT Passed socket address type in
sin_family was not AF_INET.</p>

<p>EPIPE The other end closed the socket unexpectedly or a
read is exe- cuted on a shut down socket.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The other end didnt acknowledge retransmitted
data after some time.</p>

<p>Any errors defined for ip(7) or the generic socket layer
may also be returned for TCP.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Support for Explicit Congestion Notification,
zero-copy sendfile(2), reordering support and some SACK
extensions (DSACK) were introduced in 2.4. Support for
forward acknowledgement (FACK), TIME_WAIT recycling, and
per-connection keepalive socket options were introduced in
2.3.</p>

<p>BUGS Not all errors are documented. IPv6 is not
described.</p>
