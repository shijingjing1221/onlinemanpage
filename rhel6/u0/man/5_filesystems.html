<p>FILESYSTEMS(5) Linux Programmer s Manual
FILESYSTEMS(5)</p>

<p>NAME filesystems - Linux file-system types: minix, ext,
ext2, ext3, Reiserfs, XFS, JFS, xia, msdos, umsdos, vfat,
proc, nfs, iso9660, hpfs, sysv, smb, ncpfs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When, as is customary, the proc file system
is mounted on /proc, you can find in the file
/proc/filesystems which file systems your kernel currently
supports. If you need a currently unsupported one, insert
the corresponding module or recompile the kernel.</p>

<p>In order to use a file system, you have to mount it; see
mount(8).</p>

<p>Below a short description of a few of the available file
systems.</p>

<p>minix is the file system used in the Minix operating
system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of
shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames,
a single timestamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and
RAM disks.</p>

<p>ext is an elaborate extension of the minix file system.
It has been completely superseded by the second version of
the extended file system (ext2) and has been removed from
the kernel (in 2.1.21).</p>

<p>ext2 is the high performance disk file system used by
Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second
extended file system was designed as an extension of the
extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance
(in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the file systems
supported under Linux.</p>

<p>ext3 is a journaling version of the ext2 file system. It
is easy to switch back and forth between ext2 and ext3.</p>

<p>Reiserfs is a journaling file system, designed by Hans
Reiser, that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.1.</p>

<p>XFS is a journaling file system, developed by SGI, that
was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.20.</p>

<p>JFS is a journaling file system, developed by IBM, that
was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.24.</p>

<p>xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe
file system by extending the Minix file system code. It
provides the basic most requested features without undue
complexity. The xia file system is no longer actively
developed or maintained. It was removed from the kernel in
2.1.21.</p>

<p>msdos is the file system used by DOS, Windows, and some
OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8
characters, followed by an optional period and 3 character
extension.</p>

<p>umsdos is an extended DOS file system used by Linux. It
adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX
permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.)
under the DOS file system, without sacrificing compatibility
with DOS.</p>

<p>vfat is an extended DOS file system used by Microsoft
Windows95 and Windows NT. VFAT adds the capability to use
long filenames under the MSDOS file system.</p>

<p>proc is a pseudo file system which is used as an
interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and
interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take
disk space. See proc(5).</p>

<p>iso9660 is a CD-ROM file system type conforming to the
ISO 9660 standard.</p>

<p>High Sierra Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to
the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM file systems. It is
automatically recognized within the iso9660 file- system
support under Linux.</p>

<p>Rock Ridge Linux also supports the System Use Sharing
Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the
iso9660 file system to a Unix host, and provide information
such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and
devices. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660
file-system support under Linux.</p>

<p>hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.
This file system is read-only under Linux due to the lack of
available documentation.</p>

<p>sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent file
system for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386
FS, and Coherent FS.</p>

<p>nfs is the network file system used to access disks
located on remote computers.</p>

<p>smb is a network file system that supports the SMB
protocol, used by Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and
Lan Manager.</p>

<p>To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which
can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs.</p>

<p>ncpfs is a network file system that supports the NCP
protocol, used by Novell NetWare.</p>

<p>To use ncpfs, you need special programs, which can be
found at ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/ncpfs.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO proc(5), fsck(8), mkfs(8), mount(8)</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
