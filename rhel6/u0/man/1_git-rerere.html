<p>GIT-RERERE(1) Git Manual GIT-RERERE(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-rerere - Reuse recorded resolution of
conflicted merges</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git rerere [clear|diff|status|gc]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In a workflow employing relatively long
lived topic branches, the developer sometimes needs to
resolve the same conflicts over and over again until the
topic branches are done (either merged to the
&quot;release&quot; branch, or sent out and accepted
upstream).</p>

<p>This command assists the developer in this process by
recording conflicted automerge results and corresponding
hand resolve results on the initial manual merge, and
applying previously recorded hand resolutions to their
corresponding automerge results.</p>

<p>Note You need to set the configuration variable
rerere.enabled in order to enable this command.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Normally, git rerere is run without arguments
or user-intervention. However, it has several commands that
allow it to interact with its working state.</p>

<p>clear This resets the metadata used by rerere if a merge
resolution is to be aborted. Calling git am [--skip|--abort]
or git rebase [--skip|--abort] will automatically invoke
this command.</p>

<p>diff This displays diffs for the current state of the
resolution. It is useful for tracking what has changed while
the user is resolving conflicts. Additional arguments are
passed directly to the system diff command installed in
PATH.</p>

<p>status Like diff, but this only prints the filenames
that will be tracked for resolutions.</p>

<p>gc This prunes records of conflicted merges that
occurred a long time ago. By default, unresolved conflicts
older than 15 days and resolved conflicts older than 60 days
are pruned. These defaults are controlled via the
gc.rerereunresolved and gc.rerereresolved configuration
variables respectively.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION When your topic branch modifies an
overlapping area that your master branch (or upstream)
touched since your topic branch forked from it, you may want
to test it with the latest master, even before your topic
branch is ready to be pushed upstream:</p>

<p>o---*---o topic / o---o---o---*---o---o master</p>

<p>For such a test, you need to merge master and topic
somehow. One way to do it is to pull master into the topic
branch:</p>

<p>$ git checkout topic $ git merge master</p>

<p>o---*---o---+ topic / / o---o---o---*---o---o master</p>

<p>The commits marked with * touch the same area in the
same file; you need to resolve the conflicts when creating
the commit marked with +. Then you can test the result to
make sure your work-in-progress still works with what is in
the latest master.</p>

<p>After this test merge, there are two ways to continue
your work on the topic. The easiest is to build on top of
the test merge commit +, and when your work in the topic
branch is finally ready, pull the topic branch into master,
and/or ask the upstream to pull from you. By that time,
however, the master or the upstream might have been advanced
since the test merge +, in which case the final commit graph
would look like this:</p>

<p>$ git checkout topic $ git merge master $ ... work on
both topic and master branches $ git checkout master $ git
merge topic</p>

<p>o---*---o---+---o---o topic / /
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</p>

<p>When your topic branch is long-lived, however, your
topic branch would end up having many such &quot;Merge from
master&quot; commits on it, which would unnecessarily
clutter the development history. Readers of the Linux kernel
mailing list may remember that Linus complained about such
too frequent test merges when a subsystem maintainer asked
to pull from a branch full of &quot;useless
merges&quot;.</p>

<p>As an alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of
test merges, you could blow away the test merge, and keep
building on top of the tip before the test merge:</p>

<p>$ git checkout topic $ git merge master $ git reset
--hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the test merge $ ... work on both
topic and master branches $ git checkout master $ git merge
topic</p>

<p>o---*---o-------o---o topic /
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</p>

<p>This would leave only one merge commit when your topic
branch is finally ready and merged into the master branch.
This merge would require you to resolve the conflict,
introduced by the commits marked with *. However, this
conflict is often the same conflict you resolved when you
created the test merge you blew away. git rerere helps you
resolve this final conflicted merge using the information
from your earlier hand resolve.</p>

<p>Running the git rerere command immediately after a
conflicted automerge records the conflicted working tree
files, with the usual conflict markers
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in them. Later, after you are
done resolving the conflicts, running git rerere again will
record the resolved state of these files. Suppose you did
this when you created the test merge of master into the
topic branch.</p>

<p>Next time, after seeing the same conflicted automerge,
running git rerere will perform a three-way merge between
the earlier conflicted automerge, the earlier manual
resolution, and the current conflicted automerge. If this
three-way merge resolves cleanly, the result is written out
to your working tree file, so you do not have to manually
resolve it. Note that git rerere leaves the index file
alone, so you still need to do the final sanity checks with
git diff (or git diff -c) and git add when you are
satisfied.</p>

<p>As a convenience measure, git merge automatically
invokes git rerere upon exiting with a failed automerge and
git rerere records the hand resolve when it is a new
conflict, or reuses the earlier hand resolve when it is not.
git commit also invokes git rerere when committing a merge
result. What this means is that you do not have to do
anything special yourself (besides enabling the
rerere.enabled config variable).</p>

<p>In our example, when you do the test merge, the manual
resolution is recorded, and it will be reused when you do
the actual merge later with the updated master and topic
branch, as long as the recorded resolution is still
applicable.</p>

<p>The information git rerere records is also used when
running git rebase. After blowing away the test merge and
continuing development on the topic branch:</p>

<p>o---*---o-------o---o topic /
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o master</p>

<p>$ git rebase master topic</p>

<p>o---*---o-------o---o topic /
o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o master</p>

<p>you could run git rebase master topic, to bring yourself
up-to-date before your topic is ready to be sent upstream.
This would result in falling back to a three-way merge, and
it would conflict the same way as the test merge you
resolved earlier. git rerere will be run by git rebase to
help you resolve this conflict.</p>
