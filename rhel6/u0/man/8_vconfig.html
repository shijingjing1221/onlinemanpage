<p>VCONFIG(8) VCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME vconfig - VLAN (802.1q) configuration program.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vconfig [lots of long options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The vconfig program allows you to create and
remove vlan-devices on a vlan enabled kernel. Vlan-devices
are virtual ethernet devices which represents the virtual
lans on the physical lan.</p>

<p>OPTIONS add [interface-name] [vlan-id] Creates a
vlan-device on [interface-name]. The resulting vlan-device
will be called according to the nameing convention set.</p>

<p>rem [vlan-device] Removes the named vlan-device.</p>

<p>set_flag [vlan-device] 0 | 1 When 1, ethernet header
reorders are turned on. Dumping the device will appear as a
common ethernet device without vlans. When 0(default)
however, ethernet headers are not reordered, which results
in vlan tagged packets when dumping the device. Usually the
default gives no problems, but some packet filtering
programs might have problems with it.</p>

<p>set_egress_map [vlan-device] [skb-priority] [vlan-qos]
This flags that outbound packets with a particular
skb-priority should be tagged with the particular vlan
priority vlan-qos. The default vlan priority is 0.</p>

<p>set_ingress_map [vlan-device] [skb-priority] [vlan-qos]
This flags that inbound packets with the particular vlan
prior- ity vlan-qos should be queued with a particular
skb-priority. The default skb-priority is 0.</p>

<p>set_name_type VLAN_PLUS_VID | VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD |
DEV_PLUS_VID | DEV_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD Sets the way vlan-device
names are created. Use vconfig without arguments to see the
different formats.</p>

<p>NOTES VLAN will use Broadcoms NICE interface when the
network device supports it. This is necessary, since usually
the hardware of these devices already removes the vlan tag
from the ethernet packet. The set_flag option on
vlan-devices created on such a physical network device will
be ignored. Dumping the net- work-device will show only
untagged(non-vlan) traffic, and dump- ing the vlan-devices
will only show traffic intended for that vlan, without the
tags.</p>
