<p>NAME orbd - The Object Request Broker Daemon</p>

<p>orbd is used to enable clients to transparently locate
and invoke persistent objects on servers in the CORBA
environment.</p>

<p>See also: Naming Service</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS orbd &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Server Manager included with the orbd
tool is used to enable clients to transparently locate and
invoke persistent objects on servers in the CORBA
environment. The persistent servers, while pub- lishing the
persistent object references in the Naming Service, include
the port number of the ORBD in the object reference instead
of the port number of the Server. The inclusion of an ORBD
port number in the object reference for persistent object
references has the following advantages:</p>

<p>o The object reference in the Naming Service remains
independent of the server life cycle. For example, the
object reference could be published by the server in the
Naming Service when it is first installed, and then,
independent of how many times the server is started or
shutdown, the ORBD will always return the correct object
reference to the invoking client.</p>

<p>o The client needs to lookup the object reference in the
Naming Ser- vice only once, and can keep re-using this
reference independent of the changes introduced due to
server life cycle.</p>

<p>To access ORBDs Server Manager, the server must be
started using servertool, which is a command-line interface
for application program- mers to register, unregister,
startup, and shutdown a persistent server. For more
information on the Server Manager, see the section in this
document titled Server Manager.</p>

<p>When orbd starts up, it also starts a naming service.
For more informa- tion on the naming service, link to Naming
Service.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Required Options -ORBInitialPort nameserverport
Specifies the port on which the name server should be
started. Once started, orbd will listen for incoming
requests on this port. Note that when using Solaris
software, you must become root to start a process on a port
under 1024. For this reason, we rec- ommend that you use a
port number greater than or equal to 1024. (required)</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS -port port Specifies the activation port
where ORBD should be started, and where ORBD will be
accepting requests for persistent objects. The default value
for this port is 1049. This port number is added to the port
field of the persistent Interoperable Object References
(IOR). (optional)</p>

<p>-defaultdb directory Specifies the base where the ORBD
persistent storage directory orb.db is created. If this
option is not specified, the default value is
&quot;./orb.db&quot;. (optional)</p>

<p>-serverPollingTime milliseconds Specifies how often ORBD
checks for the health of persistent servers registered via
servertool. The default value is 1,000 ms. The value
specified for milliseconds must be a valid positive integer.
(optional)</p>

<p>-serverStartupDelay milliseconds Specifies how long ORBD
waits before sending a location forward exception after a
persistent server that is registered via servertool is
restarted. The default value is 1,000 ms. The value
specified for milliseconds must be a valid positive integer.
(optional)</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where
option is one of the options described on the reference page
for the java applica- tion launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes. It is a common
convention for -J to pass options to the underlying virtual
machine.</p>

<p>Starting and Stopping the Naming Service</p>

<p>A Naming Service is a CORBA service that allows CORBA
objects to be named by means of binding a name to an object
reference. The name bind- ing may be stored in the naming
service, and a client may supply the name to obtain the
desired object reference.</p>

<p>Prior to running a client or a server, you will start
ORBD. ORBD includes a persistent Naming Service and a
transient Naming Service, both of which are an
implementation of the COS Naming Service.</p>

<p>The Persistent Naming Service provides persistence for
naming contexts. This means that this information is
persistent across service shutdowns and startups, and is
recoverable in the event of a service failure. If ORBD is
restarted, the Persistent Naming Service will restore the
nam- ing context graph, so that the binding of all clients
and servers names remains intact (persistent).</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, tnameserv, a Transient
Naming Service shipped with older versions of the JDK, is
also included in this release of J2SE. A transient naming
service retains naming contexts as long as it is running. If
there is a service interruption, the naming context graph is
lost.</p>

<p>The -ORBInitialPort argument is a required command-line
argument for orbd, and is used to set the port number on
which the Naming Service will run. The following
instructions assume you can use port 1050 for the Java IDL
Object Request Broker Daemon. When using Solaris software,
you must become root to start a process on a port under
1024. For this reason, we recommend that you use a port
number greater than or equal to 1024. You can substitute a
different port if necessary.</p>

<p>To start orbd from a UNIX command shell, enter:</p>

<p>orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050&amp;</p>

<p>From an MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter:</p>

<p>start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Now that ORBD is running, you can run your server and
client applica- tions. When running the client and server
applications, they must be made aware of the port number
(and machine name, if applicable) where the Naming Service
is running. One way to do this is to add the follow- ing
code to your application:</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;);
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost&quot;,
&quot;MyHost&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>In this example, the Naming Service is running on port
1050 on host &quot;MyHost&quot;. Another way is to specify
the port number and/or machine name when running the server
or client application from the command line. For example,
you would start your &quot;HelloApplication&quot; with the
following command line:</p>

<p>java HelloApplication -ORBInitialPort 1050
-ORBInitialHost MyHost</p>

<p>To stop the naming service, use the relevant operating
system command, such as pkill orbd on Solaris, or Ctrl+C in
the DOS window in which orbd is running. Note that names
registered with the naming service may disappear when the
service is terminated if the naming service is tran- sient.
The Java IDL naming service will run until it is explicitly
stopped.</p>

<p>For more information on the Naming Service included with
ORBD, see Nam- ing Service.</p>

<p>Server Manager To access ORBD s Server Manager and run a
persistent server, the server must be started using
servertool, which is a command-line interface for
application programmers to register, unregister, startup,
and shutdown a persistent server. When a server is started
using servertool, it must be started on the same host and
port on which orbd is executing. If the server is run on a
different port, the information stored in the database for
local contexts will be invalid and the service will not work
properly.</p>

<p>Server Manager: an Example Using the sample tutorial for
our demonstration, you would run the idlj compiler and javac
compiler as shown in the tutorial. To run the Server
Manager, follow these steps for running the application:</p>

<p>Start orbd.</p>

<p>To start orbd from a UNIX command shell, enter:</p>

<p>orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>From an MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter:</p>

<p>start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Note that 1050 is the port on which you want the name
server to run. -ORBInitialPort is a required command-line
argument. When using Solaris software, you must become root
to start a process on a port under 1024. For this reason, we
recommend that you use a port number greater than or equal
to 1024.</p>

<p>Start the servertool:</p>

<p>To start the Hello server, enter:</p>

<p>servertool -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Make sure the name server (orbd) port is the same as in
the previous step, for example, -ORBInitialPort 1050. The
servertool must be started on the same port as the name
server.</p>

<p>The servertool command line interface appears.</p>

<p>Start the Hello server from the servertool prompt:</p>

<p>servertool &gt; register -server HelloServer -classpath
. -applicationName HelloServerApName</p>

<p>The servertool registers the server, assigns it the name
of &quot;Hel- loServerApName&quot;, and displays its server
id, along with a listing of all registered servers.</p>

<p>Run the client application from another terminal window
or prompt:</p>

<p>java HelloClient -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
localhost</p>

<p>For this example, you can omit -ORBInitialHost localhost
since the name server is running on the same host as the
Hello client. If the name server is running on a different
host, use -ORBInitialHost nameserver- host to specify the
host on which the IDL name server is running.</p>

<p>Specify the name server (orbd) port as done in the
previous step, for example, -ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p>When you have finished experimenting with the Server
Manager, be sure to shut down or kill the name server (orbd)
and servertool.</p>

<p>To shut down orbd from a DOS prompt, select the window
that is running the server and enter Ctrl+C to shut it down.
To shut down orbdfrom a Unix shell, find the process, and
kill it. The server will continue to wait for invocations
until it is explicitly stopped.</p>

<p>To shut down the servertool, type quit and press the
Enter key on the keyboard.</p>
