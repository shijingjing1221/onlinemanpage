<p>XAddHost(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XAddHost(3)</p>

<p>NAME XAddHost, XAddHosts, XListHosts, XRemoveHost,
XRemoveHosts, XSetAccess- Control, XEnableAccessControl,
XDisableAccessControl, XHostAddress,
XServerInterpretedAddress - control host access and host
control struc- ture</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XAddHost(Display *display, XHostAddress
*host);</p>

<p>int XAddHosts(Display *display, XHostAddress *hosts, int
num_hosts);</p>

<p>XHostAddress *XListHosts(Display *display, int
*nhosts_return, Bool state_return);</p>

<p>int XRemoveHost(Display *display, XHostAddress
*host);</p>

<p>int XRemoveHosts(Display *display, XHostAddress *hosts,
int num_hosts);</p>

<p>int XSetAccessControl(Display *display, int mode);</p>

<p>int XEnableAccessControl(Display *display);</p>

<p>int XDisableAccessControl(Display *display);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>host Specifies the host that is to be added or
removed.</p>

<p>hosts Specifies each host that is to be added or
removed.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the mode. You can pass EnableAccess or
DisableAc- cess.</p>

<p>nhosts_return Returns the number of hosts currently in
the access control list.</p>

<p>num_hosts Specifies the number of hosts.</p>

<p>state_return Returns the state of the access
control.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XAddHost function adds the specified
host to the access control list for that display. The server
must be on the same host as the client issuing the command,
or a BadAccess error results.</p>

<p>XAddHost can generate BadAccess and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XAddHosts function adds each specified host to the
access control list for that display. The server must be on
the same host as the client issuing the command, or a
BadAccess error results.</p>

<p>XAddHosts can generate BadAccess and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The XListHosts function returns the current access
control list as well as whether the use of the list at
connection setup was enabled or dis- abled. XListHosts
allows a program to find out what machines can make
connections. It also returns a pointer to a list of host
structures that were allocated by the function. When no
longer needed, this mem- ory should be freed by calling
XFree.</p>

<p>The XRemoveHost function removes the specified host from
the access control list for that display. The server must be
on the same host as the client process, or a BadAccess error
results. If you remove your machine from the access list,
you can no longer connect to that server, and this operation
cannot be reversed unless you reset the server.</p>

<p>XRemoveHost can generate BadAccess and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The XRemoveHosts function removes each specified host
from the access control list for that display. The X server
must be on the same host as the client process, or a
BadAccess error results. If you remove your machine from the
access list, you can no longer connect to that server, and
this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the
server.</p>

<p>XRemoveHosts can generate BadAccess and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The XSetAccessControl function either enables or
disables the use of the access control list at each
connection setup.</p>

<p>XSetAccessControl can generate BadAccess and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The XEnableAccessControl function enables the use of the
access control list at each connection setup.</p>

<p>XEnableAccessControl can generate a BadAccess error.</p>

<p>The XDisableAccessControl function disables the use of
the access con- trol list at each connection setup.</p>

<p>XDisableAccessControl can generate a BadAccess
error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XHostAddress structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int family; /* for example
FamilyInternet */ int length; /* length of address, in bytes
*/ char *address; /* pointer to where to find the address */
} XHostAddress;</p>

<p>The family member specifies which protocol address
family to use (for example, TCP/IP or DECnet) and can be
FamilyInternet, FamilyInternet6, FamilyServerInterpreted,
FamilyDECnet, or FamilyChaos. The length mem- ber specifies
the length of the address in bytes. The address member
specifies a pointer to the address.</p>

<p>For the ServerInterpreted family, the length is ignored
and the address member is a pointer to a
XServerInterpretedAddress structure which con- tains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int typelength; /* length of type
string, in bytes */ int valuelength; /* length of value
string, in bytes */ char *type; /* pointer to where to find
the type string */ char *value; /* pointer to where to find
the address */ } XServerInterpretedAddress;</p>

<p>The type and value members point to strings representing
the type and value of the server interpreted entry. These
strings may not be NULL- terminated so care should be used
when accessing them. The typelength and valuelength members
specify the length in byte of the type and value
strings.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to modify the
access control list from other than the local (or otherwise
authorized) host.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
