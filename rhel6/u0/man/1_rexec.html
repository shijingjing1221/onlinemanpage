<p>REXEC(1) REXEC(1)</p>

<p>NAME rexec -- remote execution client for an exec
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rexec [ -abcdhns -l username -p password ] host
command</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rexec calls the rexec(3) routine to act as a
client for the remote hosts rexecd(8) server.</p>

<p>It asks that command be run on the host computer, using
user- name/password authentication. See rexec(3) and
rexecd(8) for details of the protocol.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Rexec accepts several options, but only three
are likely to be very useful:</p>

<p>-l username</p>

<p>Set the log-in name on the remote host to username.</p>

<p>-p password</p>

<p>Provide the password for the remote account. The command
line argument will be blanked after being parsed, to prevent
it from being seen with ps(1). However, it is still not very
secure to type the password on the command line. In
particular, be sure that the shells history file is
protected.</p>

<p>-n Explicitly prompt for name and password, even if
provided in the environment, in the $HOME/.netrc file, or in
the environmental variables REXEC_USER and REXEC_PASS.</p>

<p>Other options that might be useful with non-standard
remote exec dae- mons, or to debug connections:</p>

<p>-a Do not set up an auxiliary channel for standard error
from com- mand; the remote standard error and output are
then both returned on the local standard output. By default,
rexec asks that a separate channel be set up for diagnostic
output from the remote command.</p>

<p>-b Use signal handling as in BSD rsh(1). Only the
signals SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTERM are echoed to the
remote process. They do not remain raised locally, so rexec
waits for the remote command to shutdown its side of the
socket. Also, CNTRL-Z will only suspend execution
locally--the remote command may continue to run.</p>

<p>-c Do not close remote standard input when local
standard input closes. Normally the standard input to the
remote command is closed when the local standard input is
closed.</p>

<p>-d Turn on debugging information. In particular the
command sent to the remote host will be echoed.</p>

<p>-h Print a usage message.</p>

<p>-s Do not echo signals received by the rexec onto the
remote pro- cess. Normally, signals which can be trapped are
passed on to the remote process; then, when you type
CNTRL-C, the remote process terminates as well.</p>

<p>USERNAME AND PASSWORD Rexec(1) searches for the username
and password in the following order:</p>

<p>1. If -n is given on the command line, the user will
always be prompted for both, even if they are also given on
the command line.</p>

<p>2. The command line will be parsed</p>

<p>3. If the environmental variables REXEC_USER or
REXEC_PASS are defined, they will define the username or
password.</p>

<p>4. The $HOME/.netrc file will be searched. See ftp(1)
for a description of this files format.</p>

<p>5. Finally, the user will be prompted if either the
username or password remains undefined.</p>

<p>SECURITY Users of this command should be aware that
rexec(3) transmits their password to the remote host clear
text, not encrypted. If the network is not secure to the
remote host, the password can be comprimised.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Without the -b option, all signals which can be
handled are echoed to the remote process. Afterwards,
however, they remain raised in the local process. Typically,
this means that rexec(1) will exit after receiving a fatal
signal, even if the remote process has arranged to handle or
ignore it.</p>

<p>Differing operating systems use differing signal
numbers; for example AIX and SunOS use 18 for SIGTSTP (^Z),
while Linux uses 20. Therefore, it may have a different
effect remotely than locally. In particular, typing CNTL-Z
may not suspend the execution of the remote process.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE rexec othermachine cat &quot;&gt;remote_file;
date&quot; &lt;local_file</p>

<p>will send local_file to the othermachine as
remote_file.</p>
