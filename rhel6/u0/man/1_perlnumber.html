<p>NAME perlnumber - semantics of numbers and numeric
operations in Perl</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $n = 1234; # decimal integer $n = 0b1110011; #
binary integer $n = 01234; # octal integer $n = 0x1234; #
hexadecimal integer $n = 12.34e-56; # exponential notation
$n = &quot;-12.34e56&quot;; # number specified as a string
$n = &quot;1234&quot;; # number specified as a string</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes how Perl internally
handles numeric values.</p>

<p>Perls operator overloading facility is completely
ignored here. Operator overloading allows user-defined
behaviors for numbers, such as operations over arbitrarily
large integers, floating points numbers with arbitrary
precision, operations over &quot;exotic&quot; numbers such
as modular arithmetic or p-adic arithmetic, and so on. See
overload for details.</p>

<p>Storing numbers Perl can internally represent numbers in
3 different ways: as native integers, as native floating
point numbers, and as decimal strings. Decimal strings may
have an exponential notation part, as in
&quot;12.34e-56&quot;. Native here means &quot;a format
supported by the C compiler which was used to build
perl&quot;.</p>

<p>The term &quot;native&quot; does not mean quite as much
when we talk about native integers, as it does when native
floating point numbers are involved. The only implication of
the term &quot;native&quot; on integers is that the limits
for the maximal and the minimal supported true integral
quantities are close to powers of 2. However,
&quot;native&quot; floats have a most fundamental
restriction: they may represent only those numbers which
have a relatively &quot;short&quot; representation when
converted to a binary fraction. For example, 0.9 cannot be
represented by a native float, since the binary fraction for
0.9 is infinite:</p>

<p>binary0.1110011001100...</p>

<p>with the sequence 1100 repeating again and again. In
addition to this limitation, the exponent of the binary
number is also restricted when it is represented as a
floating point number. On typical hardware, floating point
values can store numbers with up to 53 binary digits, and
with binary exponents between -1024 and 1024. In decimal
representation this is close to 16 decimal digits and
decimal exponents in the range of -304..304. The upshot of
all this is that Perl cannot store a number like
12345678901234567 as a floating point number on such
architectures without loss of information.</p>

<p>Similarly, decimal strings can represent only those
numbers which have a finite decimal expansion. Being
strings, and thus of arbitrary length, there is no practical
limit for the exponent or number of decimal digits for these
numbers. (But realize that what we are discussing the rules
for just the storage of these numbers. The fact that you can
store such &quot;large&quot; numbers does not mean that the
operations over these numbers will use all of the
significant digits. See &quot;Numeric operators and numeric
conversions&quot; for details.)</p>

<p>In fact numbers stored in the native integer format may
be stored either in the signed native form, or in the
unsigned native form. Thus the limits for Perl numbers
stored as native integers would typically be
-2**31..2**32-1, with appropriate modifications in the case
of 64-bit integers. Again, this does not mean that Perl can
do operations only over integers in this range: it is
possible to store many more integers in floating point
format.</p>

<p>Summing up, Perl numeric values can store only those
numbers which have a finite decimal expansion or a
&quot;short&quot; binary expansion.</p>

<p>Numeric operators and numeric conversions As mentioned
earlier, Perl can store a number in any one of three
formats, but most operators typically understand only one of
those formats. When a numeric value is passed as an argument
to such an operator, it will be converted to the format
understood by the operator.</p>

<p>Six such conversions are possible:</p>

<p>native integer --&gt; native floating point (*) native
integer --&gt; decimal string native floating_point --&gt;
native integer (*) native floating_point --&gt; decimal
string (*) decimal string --&gt; native integer decimal
string --&gt; native floating point (*)</p>

<p>These conversions are governed by the following general
rules:</p>

<p>&middot; If the source number can be represented in the
target form, that representation is used.</p>

<p>&middot; If the source number is outside of the limits
representable in the target form, a representation of the
closest limit is used. (Loss of information)</p>

<p>&middot; If the source number is between two numbers
representable in the target form, a representation of one of
these numbers is used. (Loss of information)</p>

<p>&middot; In &quot;native floating point --&gt; native
integer&quot; conversions the magnitude of the result is
less than or equal to the magnitude of the source.
(&quot;Rounding to zero&quot;.)</p>

<p>&middot; If the &quot;decimal string --&gt; native
integer&quot; conversion cannot be done without loss of
information, the result is compatible with the conversion
sequence &quot;decimal_string --&gt; native_floating_point
--&gt; native_integer&quot;. In particular, rounding is
strongly biased to 0, though a number like
&quot;0.99999999999999999999&quot; has a chance of being
rounded to 1.</p>

<p>RESTRICTION: The conversions marked with &quot;(*)&quot;
above involve steps performed by the C compiler. In
particular, bugs/features of the compiler used may lead to
breakage of some of the above rules.</p>

<p>Flavors of Perl numeric operations Perl operations which
take a numeric argument treat that argument in one of four
different ways: they may force it to one of the
integer/floating/ string formats, or they may behave
differently depending on the format of the operand. Forcing
a numeric value to a particular format does not change the
number stored in the value.</p>

<p>All the operators which need an argument in the integer
format treat the argument as in modular arithmetic, e.g.,
&quot;mod 2**32&quot; on a 32-bit architecture.
&quot;sprintf &quot;%u&quot;, -1&quot; therefore provides
the same result as &quot;sprintf &quot;%u&quot;,
~0&quot;.</p>

<p>Arithmetic operators The binary operators &quot;+&quot;
&quot;-&quot; &quot;*&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;%&quot;
&quot;==&quot; &quot;!=&quot; &quot;&gt;&quot;
&quot;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;=&quot; &quot;&lt;=&quot; and the
unary operators &quot;-&quot; &quot;abs&quot; and
&quot;--&quot; will attempt to convert arguments to
integers. If both conversions are possible without loss of
precision, and the operation can be performed without loss
of precision then the integer result is used. Otherwise
arguments are converted to floating point format and the
floating point result is used. The caching of conversions
(as described above) means that the integer conversion does
not throw away fractional parts on floating point
numbers.</p>

<p>++ &quot;++&quot; behaves as the other operators above,
except that if it is a string matching the format
&quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*&quot; the string increment described
in perlop is used.</p>

<p>Arithmetic operators during &quot;use integer&quot; In
scopes where &quot;use integer;&quot; is in force, nearly
all the operators listed above will force their argument(s)
into integer format, and return an integer result. The
exceptions, &quot;abs&quot;, &quot;++&quot; and
&quot;--&quot;, do not change their behavior with &quot;use
integer;&quot;</p>

<p>Other mathematical operators Operators such as
&quot;**&quot;, &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;exp&quot; force
arguments to floating point format.</p>

<p>Bitwise operators Arguments are forced into the integer
format if not strings.</p>

<p>Bitwise operators during &quot;use integer&quot; forces
arguments to integer format. Also shift operations
internally use signed integers rather than the default
unsigned.</p>

<p>Operators which expect an integer force the argument
into the integer format. This is applicable to the third and
fourth arguments of &quot;sysread&quot;, for example.</p>

<p>Operators which expect a string force the argument into
the string format. For example, this is applicable to
&quot;printf &quot;%s&quot;, $value&quot;.</p>

<p>Though forcing an argument into a particular form does
not change the stored number, Perl remembers the result of
such conversions. In particular, though the first such
conversion may be time-consuming, repeated operations will
not need to redo the conversion.</p>
