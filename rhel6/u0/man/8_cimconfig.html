<p>NAME cimconfig - get, set, unset, or list CIM Server
configuration proper- ties</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cimconfig -g name [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig -s name=value [ -c ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig -u name [ -c ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig -l [ -c | -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cimconfig command manages CIM Server
configuration properties. The operations are executed on the
local host by submitting requests to the CIM Server. An
operation on a current configuration property takes effect
immediately, and an operation on a planned configuration
prop- erty takes effect the next time the CIM Server is
started with cim- server (8) . Modifications to a
configuration property via cimconfig remain in effect until
changed via another cimconfig command. Configu- ration
properties may also be modified temporarily via the
cimserver (8) command, in which case, the modification of
the configuration prop- erty remains in effect for that
execution of the cimserver (8) command only. A default value
is associated with each configuration property. Each
configuration property is initially assigned its default
value, until modified by a cimconfig command or cimserver
(8) command. Dynamic configuration properties are those
whose current values may be set while the CIM server is
running.</p>

<p>The following configuration properties are
available:</p>

<p>authorizedUserGroups</p>

<p>Description: If set, the value is interpreted as a list
of comma-separated user groups whose members may issue CIM
requests. A user who is not a member of any of these groups
is restricted from issuing CIM requests, with the exception
of privileged users (superuser). If unset, any user may
issue CIM requests. Note: This configuration property
operates in conjunc- tion with other CIM request
authorization conditions rather than overriding them.
Default Value: (None) Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableAssociationTraversal</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server will support the
four asso- ciation traversal operators: Associators,
AssociatorNames, Ref- erences, and ReferenceNames. Default
Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableAuditLog</p>

<p>Description: If True, audit log entries for certain
types of CIM Server activities will be written to the system
log. Examples of audited activities include a CIM Server
configuration change, a Provider registration change, an
authentication attempt and a modification to the CIM Schema
or a CIM Instance. An audit log entry describes the who,
what, and when associated with an audited activity. Default
Value: False Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>enableIndicationService</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server will support CIM
Indica- tions. Default Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableHttpConnection</p>

<p>Description: If True, allows connections to the CIM
Server using the HTTP protocol Default Value: False Dynamic:
No</p>

<p>enableHttpsConnection</p>

<p>Description: If True, allows connections to the CIM
Server using the HTTPS protocol (HTTP using Secure Socket
Layer encryption) Default Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableNamespaceAuthorization</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server restricts access to
names- paces based on configured user authorizations [user
authoriza- tions may be configured using cimauth (8) ]
Default Value: False Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableRemotePrivilegedUserAccess</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server allows access by a
privi- leged user from a remote system Default Value: True
Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableSubscriptionsForNonprivilegedUsers</p>

<p>Description: If True, nonprivileged user of the system
will be allowed to create Indication Subscription, otherwise
privileged access is required. Default Value: False Dynamic:
No</p>

<p>forceProviderProcesses</p>

<p>Description: If true, the CIM Server runs Providers in
separate processes rather than loading and calling Provider
libraries directly within the CIM Server process. Default
Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>idleConnectionTimeout</p>

<p>Description: If set to a positive integer, this value
specifies a minimum timeout value for idle client
connections. If set to zero, idle client connections do not
time out. Aclientconnec-
tionisconsideredidlewhenitisnotintheprocessof sending a
request and the CIM Server is not processing a request from
that connec- tion. An idle connection timeout allows
reclamation of the sys- tem resources allocated for idle CIM
Server connections. Note that the CIM Server may allow an
idle connection to persist longer than the configured
timeout value based on server activ- ity.
Someclientapplicationsmaynotbehavecorrectlyifaconnection-
timeout is introduced. Client compatibility should be
consid- ered when configuring an idle connection timeout
value. Thei-
dleconnectiontimeiscomputedusingthesystemclock.Thus,
resetting the system clock may cause unexpected timeout
behavior. Default Value: 0 Dynamic: No</p>

<p>shutdownTimeout</p>

<p>Description: When a cimserver -s shutdown command is
issued, specifies the maximum time in seconds for the CIM
Server to com- plete outstanding CIM operation requests
before shutting down; if the specified timeout period
expires, the CIM Server will shut down, even if there are
still CIM operations in progress. Minimum value is 2
seconds. Default Value: 30 Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>socketWriteTimeout</p>

<p>Description: Specifies the number of seconds the CIM
Server will wait for a client connection to be ready to
receive data. If the CIM Server is unable to write to a
connection in this time, the connection is closed.
Aclientconnectioncanbecomeunabletore-
ceivedataiftheclientfails to read the data that has already
been sent. This timeout allows the CIM Server to reclaim
resources that are allocated to a malfunctioning client.

prematurely closes connections with well-behaved clients.
Default Value: 20 Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>sslClientVerificationMode</p>

<p>Description: Defines the desired level of support for
certifi- cate-based authentication. It can be set to
required, optional or disabled. If set to required, the CIM
Server will require all clients connecting over HTTPS to
authenticate using a cer- tificate. If the client
certificate is not sent or not trusted the connection will
be rejected. If set to optional, the CIM Server will allow,
but not require, HTTPS clients to authenti- cate using a
certificate. If the client does not send a certifi- cate,
the CIM Server will attempt to authenticate the client using
HTTP basic authentication. If set to disabled, the CIM
Server will not allow HTTPS clients to authenticate using a
cer- tificate. Basic authentication will be used to
authenticate all HTTPS clients. This property is only used
if enableHttpsConnec- tion is true. Default Value: disabled
Dynamic: No</p>

<p>If both the enableHttpsConnection and
enableHttpConnection properties are set to False , neither
HTTP nor HTTPS connections will be allowed. On some
platforms, the OpenPegasus CIM Server has been enhanced to
include support for a local (single system), non-standard
protocol. This allows the OpenPegasus CIM Server to continue
to receive and pro- cess requests from local OpenPegasus CIM
Clients even if both HTTP ports are disabled. If a local
protocol is not supported, the CIM Server will be shut down
and disabled from automatically being re-started.</p>

<p>The current and planned values of the configuration
properties are stored in the files
/var/opt/tog-pegasus/cimserver_current.conf and
/var/opt/tog-pegasus/cimserver_planned.conf , respectively.
The con- figuration properties may only be modified via the
cimconfig and cim- server (8) commands; the files must not
be edited directly.</p>

<p>Options The cimconfig command recognizes the following
options:</p>

<p>-g configuration_property Gets the specified value
(current, planned and/or default) of the specified
configuration property. By default, gets the current
value.</p>

<p>-s configuration_property = value Sets the specified
value (current and/or planned) of the specified
configuration property to R value . By default, sets the
current value.</p>

<p>-u configuration_property Unsets the specified value
(current and/or planned) of the specified configuration
property, and resets it to its default value. By default,
unsets the current value and resets it to its default
value.</p>

<p>-l Lists all the specified (current or planned) con-
figuration property name and value pairs in the CIM Server.
By default, lists only the names of all the current
configuration properties.</p>

<p>-c Specifies that the operation (get, set, unset, or
list) be performed on the current configuration properties.
For set or unset operations, returns an error when the CIM
Server is not running or the specified property is not a
dynamic property.</p>

<p>-p Specifies that the operation (get, set, unset, or
list) be performed on the planned configuration properties.
For set and unset operations, oper- ates on the value of the
specified property in the planned configuration file if the
CIM Server is not running.</p>

<p>-d Specifies that the get operation be performed on the
default configuration properties. Returns an error when the
CIM Server is not running.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, cimconfig displays a usage
message.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When an error occurs, an error message is
written to stderr and an error value of 1 is returned. The
following return values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion 1 Error</p>
