<p>PM-POWERSAVE(8) pm-utils User Manual PM-POWERSAVE(8)</p>

<p>NAME pm-powersave - Put your computer into low power
mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pm-powersave [{true | false}]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
pm-powersave command.</p>

<p>pm-powersave can be used to set your system into low
power mode.</p>

<p>OPTIONS true Set the computer into low power mode to
reduce energy consumption and extend your laptop&acute;s
battery life.</p>

<p>false Turn off low power mode.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/pm/power.d/, /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ When
you run pm-powersave it combines the scripts in these two
directories and executes them in sorted order. If both
directories contain a script with the same name, the one in
/etc/pm/power.d/ has a higher precedence and only this one
will be executed.</p>

<p>Therefore to disable a script from
/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ simply create an empty file in
/etc/pm/power.d/ with the same name and without the execute
bit set.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pm-suspend(8), pm-hibernate(8)</p>
