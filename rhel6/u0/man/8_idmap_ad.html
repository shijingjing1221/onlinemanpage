<p>NAME idmap_ad - Samba&acute;s idmap_ad Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for
Winbind to read id mappings from an AD server that uses
RFC2307/SFU schema extensions. This module implements only
the &quot;idmap&quot; API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be
provided in advance by the administrator by adding the
posixAccount/posixGroup classes and relative attribute/value
pairs to the user and group objects in the AD.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS range = low - high Defines the available
matching UID and GID range for which the backend is
authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the
range is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded. It
is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
between local and remotely defined IDs.</p>

<p>schema_mode = &lt;rfc2307 | sfu &gt; Defines the schema
that idmap_ad should use when querying Active Directory
regarding user and group information. This can be either the
RFC2307 schema support included in Windows 2003 R2 or the
Service for Unix (SFU) schema.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example shows how to retrieve
idmappings from our principal and trusted AD domains. If
trusted domains are present id conflicts must be resolved
beforehand, there is no guarantee on the order conflicting
mappings would be resolved at this point. This example also
shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local
id allocation that may be used in internal backends like
BUILTIN.</p>

<p>[global] idmap backend = tdb idmap uid = 1000000-1999999
idmap gid = 1000000-1999999</p>

<p>idmap config CORP : backend = ad idmap config CORP :
range = 1000-999999</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
