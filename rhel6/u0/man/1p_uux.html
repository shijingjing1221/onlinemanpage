<p>UUX(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UUX(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uux - remote command execution</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uux [-np] command-string</p>

<p>uux [-jnp] command-string</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uux utility shall gather zero or more
files from various systems, execute a shell pipeline (see
Shell Commands ) on a specified system, and then send the
standard output of the command to a file on a speci- fied
system. Only the first command of a pipeline can have a
system- name! prefix. All other commands in the pipeline
shall be executed on the system of the first command.</p>

<p>The following restrictions are applicable to the shell
pipeline pro- cessed by uux:</p>

<p>* In gathering files from different systems, pathname
expansion shall not be performed by uux. Thus, a request
such as:</p>

<p>uux &quot;c99 remsys!~/*.c&quot;</p>

<p>would attempt to copy the file named literally *.c to
the local system.</p>

<p>* The redirection operators &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;|&quot;, and
&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot; shall not be accepted. Any use of
these redirection operators shall cause this utility to
write an error message describing the problem and exit with
a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>* The reserved word ! cannot be used at the head of the
pipeline to modify the exit status. (See the command-string
operand description below.)</p>

<p>* Alias substitution shall not be performed.</p>

<p>A filename can be specified as for uucp; it can be an
absolute path- name, a pathname preceded by ~ name (which is
replaced by the corre- sponding login directory), a pathname
specified as ~/ dest ( dest is prefixed by the public
directory called PUBDIR; the actual location of PUBDIR is
implementation-defined), or a simple filename (which is pre-
fixed by uux with the current directory). See uucp for the
details.</p>

<p>The execution of commands on remote systems shall take
place in an exe- cution directory known to the uucp system.
All files required for the execution shall be put into this
directory unless they already reside on that machine.
Therefore, the application shall ensure that non-local
filenames (without path or machine reference) are unique
within the uux request.</p>

<p>The uux utility shall attempt to get all files to the
execution system. For files that are output files, the
application shall ensure that the filename is escaped using
parentheses.</p>

<p>The remote system shall notify the user by mail if the
requested com- mand on the remote system was disallowed or
the files were not accessi- ble. This notification can be
turned off by the -n option.</p>

<p>Typical implementations of this utility require a
communications line configured to use the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Terminal
Interface, but other communications means may be used. On
systems where there are no available communications means
(either temporarily or permanently), this utility shall
write an error message describing the problem and exit with
a non-zero exit sta- tus.</p>

<p>The uux utility cannot guarantee support for all
character encodings in all circumstances. For example,
transmission data may be restricted to 7 bits by the
underlying network, 8-bit data and filenames need not be
portable to non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under
these cir- cumstances, it is recommended that only
characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
International Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit
range of characters be used and that only characters defined
in the portable filename character set be used for naming
files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uux utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p Make the standard input to uux the standard input to
the com- mand-string.</p>

<p>-j Write the job identification string to standard
output. This job identification can be used by uustat to
obtain the status or terminate a job.</p>

<p>-n Do not notify the user if the command fails.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>command-string</p>

<p>A string made up of one or more arguments that are
similar to normal command arguments, except that the command
and any file- names can be prefixed by system-name!. A null
system-name shall be interpreted as the local system.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall not be used unless the-
or -p option is specified; in those cases, the standard
input shall be made the stan- dard input of the
command-string.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be selected according to
the contents of command- string.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uux:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall not be used unless the
-j option is speci- fied; in that case, the job
identification string shall be written to standard output in
the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;jobid&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Output files shall be created or written,
or both, according to the contents of command-string.</p>

<p>If -n is not used, mail files shall be modified
following any command or file-access failures on the remote
system.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Note that, for security reasons, many
installations limit the list of commands executable on
behalf of an incoming request from uux. Many sites permit
little more than the receipt of mail via uux.</p>

<p>Any characters special to the command interpreter should
be quoted either by quoting the entire command-string or
quoting the special characters as individual arguments.</p>

<p>As noted in uucp, shell pattern matching notation
characters appearing in pathnames are expanded on the
appropriate local system. This is done under the control of
local settings of LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE . Thus, care
should be taken when using bracketed filename patterns, as
colla- tion and typing rules may vary from one system to
another. Also be aware that certain types of expression
(that is, equivalence classes, character classes, and
collating symbols) need not be supported on non-
internationalized systems.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following command gets file1 from system
a and file2 from sys- tem b, executes diff on the local
system, and puts the results in file.diff in the local
PUBDIR directory. ( PUBDIR is the uucp pub- lic directory on
the local system.)</p>

<p>uux &quot;!diff a!/usr/file1 b!/a4/file2
&gt;!~/file.diff&quot;</p>

<p>2. The following command fails because uux places all
files copied to a system in the same working directory.
Although the files xyz are from two different systems, their
filenames are the same and con- flict.</p>

<p>uux &quot;!diff a!/usr1/xyz b!/usr2/xyz
&gt;!~/xyz.diff&quot;</p>

<p>3. The following command succeeds (assuming diff is
permitted on sys- tem a) because the file local to system a
is not copied to the working directory, and hence does not
conflict with the file from system c.</p>

<p>uux &quot;a!diff a!/usr/xyz c!/usr/xyz
&gt;!~/xyz.diff&quot;</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
