<p>NAME osinfo - gather information regarding the running
operating system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS osinfo [ -s ] [ -h hostname ] [ -p portnumber ]
[ -u username ] [ -w password ] [ -t timeout ] [ -c ] [
--help ] [ --version ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The osinfo command displays information
regarding the operating system, gathered via WBEM using the
PG_OperatingSystem class supported by the OperatingSystem
Provider (bundled with OpenPegasus). osinfo requires the CIM
Server to be installed and running.</p>

<p>By default, the information is formatted for display,
converting CIM- DateTime strings into a more user-readable
format (see Examples), and converting the total number of
seconds of uptime into the appropriate number of days,
hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>

<p>If a property value is unavailable, it will be shown as
&quot;Unknown&quot;</p>

<p>Options osinfo recognizes the following options:</p>

<p>-c Use the CIM formats for DateTime and SystemUpTime
values (not the formatting done by default). As specified by
the DMTF, the CIMDateTime format is
yyyymmddhhmmss.mmmmmmsutc, where yyyy is a 4-digit year, mm
is the month, dd is the day, hh is the hour on a 24-hour
clock, mm is the minute, ss is the second, mmmmmm is the
number of microseconds, s is a &quot;+&quot; or
&quot;-&quot; indicating the sign of the UTC (Universal Time
Code) correction field (since the DateTime is returned in
the local time zone of the system), and utc is the offset
from UTC in minutes.</p>

<p>-h hostname Connect to the CIM Server on the specified
host. If this option is not specified, osinfo connects to
the localhost.</p>

<p>--help Display command usage information.</p>

<p>-p portnumber Connect to the CIM Server on the specified
port number. If this option is not specified, osinfo
connects to the default port for the wbem-http service, or
if the -s option is specified, to the default port for the
wbem-https service.</p>

<p>-s Enable the use of the SSL protocol between osinfo and
the CIM server. The -s option should be specified if the CIM
Server on the specified hostname/portnumber expects clients
to connect using HTTPS.</p>

<p>-t timeout Wait the specified number of milliseconds on
sending a request, before timing out if no response has been
received. The timeout value must be an integer value greater
than 0.</p>

<p>-u username Connect as the specified R username . If
user- name is not specified, the current logged in user is
used for authentication. This option is ignored if neither
hostname nor portnumber is specified.</p>

<p>--version Display CIM Server version.</p>

<p>-w password Authenticate the connection using the
specified password . This option is ignored if neither
hostname nor portnumber is specified. WARNING: A password
should not be specified on the command line on a multi-user
system, since command-line options are typically
world-readable for a short window of time. If the remote
host requests authentication and this option is not
specified, osinfo will prompt for the password.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS When an error occurs, an error message is
written to stderr and an appropriate value is returned. The
following values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Success 1 Error</p>

<p>USAGE NOTE The osinfo command requires that the CIM
Server is running.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS osinfo error: Cannot connect</p>

<p>The CIMOM is not running. Start the CIMOM with the
cimserver command and re-run osinfo .</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Run the default osinfo command.</p>

<p>OperatingSystem Information Host: myserver.hp.com Name:
HP-UX Version: B.11.00 UserLicense: Unlimited user license
OSCapability: 32 bit LastBootTime: Sep 24, 2001 9:16:18

<p>The system myserver.hp.com is running version B.11.00 of
HP-UX, has an unlimited user license, and is 32-bit capable.
The Oper- ating System was last booted on Sept 24, 2001 and
the local date and time are given. All time values are
offset from GMT by -7 hours.</p>

<p>Run osinfo , with the values displayed in their CIM
format</p>

<p>osinfo -c</p>

<p>OperatingSystem Information Host: rushmore.cup.hp.com

<p>The same rushmore.cup.hp.com system is displayed, but in
this output the LastBootTime and LocalDateTime values are in
the CIM format. The SystemUpTime value is in total seconds
(as speci- fied by CIM). Other fields do not change, as
their CIM specifi- cation is the strings themselves.</p>
