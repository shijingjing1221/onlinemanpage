<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server,
dhcpd, implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP
allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be assigned
IP addresses, and also to discover information about the
network to which they are attached. BOOTP provides similar
functional- ity, with certain restrictions.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTIONS This software is free software. At various
times its development has been underwritten by various
organizations, including the ISC and Vixie Enterprises. The
development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
Nominum, Inc.</p>

<p>At this point development is being shepherded by Ted
Lemon, and hosted by the ISC, but the future of this project
depends on you. If you have features you want, please
consider implementing them.</p>

<p>OPERATION The DHCP protocol allows a host which is
unknown to the network admin- istrator to be automatically
assigned a new IP address out of a pool of IP addresses for
its network. In order for this to work, the network
administrator allocates address pools in each subnet and
enters them into the dhcpd.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>On startup, dhcpd reads the dhcpd.conf file and stores a
list of avail- able addresses on each subnet in memory. When
a client requests an address using the DHCP protocol, dhcpd
allocates an address for it. Each client is assigned a
lease, which expires after an amount of time chosen by the
administrator (by default, one day). Before leases expire,
the clients to which leases are assigned are expected to
renew them in order to continue to use the addresses. Once a
lease has expired, the client to which that lease was
assigned is no longer per- mitted to use the leased IP
address.</p>

<p>In order to keep track of leases across system reboots
and server restarts, dhcpd keeps a list of leases it has
assigned in the dhcpd.leases(5) file. Before dhcpd grants a
lease to a host, it records the lease in this file and makes
sure that the contents of the file are flushed to disk. This
ensures that even in the event of a system crash, dhcpd will
not forget about a lease that it has assigned. On startup,
after reading the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd reads the
dhcpd.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
have been assigned.</p>

<p>New leases are appended to the end of the dhcpd.leases
file. In order to prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily
large, from time to time dhcpd creates a new dhcpd.leases
file from its in-core lease database. Once this file has
been written to disk, the old file is renamed dhcpd.leases~,
and the new file is renamed dhcpd.leases. If the sys- tem
crashes in the middle of this process, whichever
dhcpd.leases file remains will contain all the lease
information, so there is no need for a special crash
recovery process.</p>

<p>BOOTP support is also provided by this server. Unlike
DHCP, the BOOTP protocol does not provide a protocol for
recovering dynamically- assigned addresses once they are no
longer needed. It is still possi- ble to dynamically assign
addresses to BOOTP clients, but some adminis- trative
process for reclaiming addresses is required. By default,
leases are granted to BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although
the network administrator may set an earlier cutoff date or
a shorter lease length for BOOTP leases if that makes
sense.</p>

<p>BOOTP clients may also be served in the old standard
way, which is to simply provide a declaration in the
dhcpd.conf file for each BOOTP client, permanently assigning
an address to each client.</p>

<p>Whenever changes are made to the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd
must be restarted. To restart dhcpd, send a SIGTERM (signal
15) to the pro- cess ID contained in /var/run/dhcpd.pid, and
then re-invoke dhcpd. Because the DHCP server database is
not as lightweight as a BOOTP database, dhcpd does not
automatically restart itself when it sees a change to the
dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p>Note: We get a lot of complaints about this. We realize
that it would be nice if one could send a SIGHUP to the
server and have it reload the database. This is not
technically impossible, but it would require a great deal of
work, our resources are extremely limited, and they can be
better spent elsewhere. So please dont complain about this
on the mailing list unless youre prepared to fund a project
to implement this feature, or prepared to do it
yourself.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE The names of the network interfaces on
which dhcpd should listen for broadcasts may be specified on
the command line. This should be done on systems where dhcpd
is unable to identify non-broadcast interfaces, but should
not be required on other systems. If no interface names are
specified on the command line dhcpd will identify all
network inter- faces which are up, eliminating non-broadcast
interfaces if possible, and listen for DHCP broadcasts on
each interface.</p>

<p>The server either operates as a DHCPv6 server or a DHCP
server, but not both at the same time. To run as a DHCPv6
server, use the -6 flag. To run as a DHCP server, use the -4
flag. If neither is used, the default is to run as a DHCPv6
server.</p>

<p>If dhcpd should listen on a port other than the standard
(port 67), the -p flag may used. It should be followed by
the udp port number on which dhcpd should listen. This is
mostly useful for debugging pur- poses.</p>

<p>If dhcpd should send replies to an address other than
the broadcast address (255.255.255.255), the -s flag may be
used. It is followed by either the IP address or the host
name to send replies to. This option is only supported in
IPv4.</p>

<p>To run dhcpd as a foreground process, rather than
allowing it to run as a daemon in the background, the -f
flag should be specified. This is useful when running dhcpd
under a debugger, or when running it out of inittab on
System V systems.</p>

<p>To have dhcpd log to the standard error descriptor,
specify the -d flag. This can be useful for debugging, and
also at sites where a com- plete log of all dhcp activity
must be kept but syslogd is not reliable or otherwise cannot
be used. Normally, dhcpd will log all output using the
syslog(3) function with the log facility set to LOG_DAEMON.
Note that -d implies -f (the daemon will not fork itself
into the back- ground).</p>

<p>Dhcpd can be made to use an alternate configuration file
with the -cf flag, an alternate lease file with the -lf
flag, or an alternate pid file with the -pf flag. Because of
the importance of using the same lease database at all times
when running dhcpd in production, these options should be
used only for testing lease files or database files in a
non-production environment.</p>

<p>When starting dhcpd up from a system startup script
(e.g., /etc/rc), it may not be desirable to print out the
entire copyright message on startup. To avoid printing this
message, the -q flag may be speci- fied.</p>

<p>The DHCP server reads two files on startup: a
configuration file, and a lease database. If the -t flag is
specified, the server will simply test the configuration
file for correct syntax, but will not attempt to perform any
network operations. This can be used to test the a new
configuration file automatically before installing it.</p>

<p>The -T flag can be used to test the lease database file
in a similar way.</p>

<p>The -tf and -play options allow you to specify a file
into which the entire startup state of the server and all
the transactions it pro- cesses are either logged or played
back from. This can be useful in submitting bug reports - if
you are getting a core dump every so often, you can start
the server with the -tf option and then, when the server
dumps core, the trace file will contain all the transactions
that led up to it dumping core, so that the problem can be
easily debugged with -play.</p>

<p>The -play option must be specified with an alternate
lease file, using the -lf switch, so that the DHCP server
doesnt wipe out your existing lease file with its test data.
The DHCP server will refuse to operate in playback mode
unless you specify an alternate lease file.</p>

<p>To find the version of dhcpd that will run, use the
--version argument. Instead of running, the version will be
printed.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The syntax of the dhcpd.conf(5) file is
discussed separately. This section should be used as an
overview of the configuration process, and the dhcpd.conf(5)
documentation should be consulted for detailed refer- ence
information.</p>

<p>Subnets dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and
netmasks of all subnets for which it will be providing
service. In addition, in order to dynami- cally allocate
addresses, it must be assigned one or more ranges of
addresses on each subnet which it can in turn assign to
client hosts as they boot. Thus, a very simple configuration
providing DHCP support might look like this:</p>

<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range
239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250; }</p>

<p>Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:</p>

<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range
239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107; range 239.252.197.113
239.252.197.250; }</p>

<p>If a subnet will only be provided with BOOTP service and
no dynamic address assignment, the range clause can be left
out entirely, but the subnet statement must appear.</p>

<p>Lease Lengths DHCP leases can be assigned almost any
length from zero seconds to infinity. What lease length
makes sense for any given subnet, or for any given
installation, will vary depending on the kinds of hosts
being served.</p>

<p>For example, in an office environment where systems are
added from time to time and removed from time to time, but
move relatively infre- quently, it might make sense to allow
lease times of a month of more. In a final test environment
on a manufacturing floor, it may make more sense to assign a
maximum lease length of 30 minutes - enough time to go
through a simple test procedure on a network appliance
before pack- aging it up for delivery.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify two lease lengths: the default
length that will be assigned if a client doesn t ask for any
particular lease length, and a maximum lease length. These
are specified as clauses to the subnet command:</p>

<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range
239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107; default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200; }</p>

<p>This particular subnet declaration specifies a default
lease time of 600 seconds (ten minutes), and a maximum lease
time of 7200 seconds (two hours). Other common values would
be 86400 (one day), 604800 (one week) and 2592000 (30
days).</p>

<p>Each subnet need not have the same leasein the case of
an office envi- ronment and a manufacturing environment
served by the same DHCP server, it might make sense to have
widely disparate values for default and maximum lease times
on each subnet.</p>

<p>BOOTP Support Each BOOTP client must be explicitly
declared in the dhcpd.conf file. A very basic client
declaration will specify the client network inter- face s
hardware address and the IP address to assign to that
client. If the client needs to be able to load a boot file
from the server, that files name must be specified. A simple
bootp client declaration might look like this:</p>

<p>host haagen { hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
fixed-address 239.252.197.9; filename
&quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;; }</p>

<p>Options DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions)
provide a mechanism whereby the server can provide the
client with information about how to configure its network
interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how the client can
access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and
so on).</p>

<p>These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis,
and, for BOOTP clients, also on a per-client basis. In the
event that a BOOTP client declaration specifies options that
are also specified in its subnet declaration, the options
specified in the client declaration take precedence. A
reasonably complete DHCP configuration might look some-
thing like this:</p>

<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range
239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250; default-lease-time 600
max-lease-time 7200; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255; option routers
239.252.197.1; option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2,
239.252.197.3; option domain-name &quot;isc.org&quot;; }</p>

<p>A bootp host on that subnet that needs to be in a
different domain and use a different name server might be
declared as follows:</p>

<p>host haagen { hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
fixed-address 239.252.197.9; filename
&quot;/tftpboot/haagen.boot&quot;; option
domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1; option domain-name
&quot;vix.com&quot;; }</p>

<p>A more complete description of the dhcpd.conf file
syntax is provided in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>OMAPI The DHCP server provides the capability to modify
some of its configu- ration while it is running, without
stopping it, modifying its database files, and restarting
it. This capability is currently provided using OMAPI - an
API for manipulating remote objects. OMAPI clients connect
to the server using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then
examine the servers current status and make changes to
it.</p>

<p>Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol
directly, user programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI
itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that handles some of the
housekeeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically.
Dhcpctl and OMAPI are documented in dhcpctl(3) and
omapi(3).</p>

<p>OMAPI exports objects, which can then be examined and
modified. The DHCP server exports the following objects:
lease, host, failover-state and group. Each object has a
number of methods that are provided: lookup, create, and
destroy. In addition, it is possible to look at attributes
that are stored on objects, and in some cases to modify
those attributes.</p>

<p>THE LEASE OBJECT Leases cant currently be created or
destroyed, but they can be looked up to examine and modify
their state.</p>

<p>Leases have the following attributes:</p>

<p>state integer lookup, examine 1 = free 2 = active 3 =
expired 4 = released 5 = abandoned 6 = reset 7 = backup 8 =
reserved 9 = bootp</p>

<p>ip-address data lookup, examine The IP address of the
lease.</p>

<p>dhcp-client-identifier data lookup, examine, update The
client identifier that the client used when it acquired the
lease. Not all clients send client identifiers, so this may
be empty.</p>

<p>client-hostname data examine, update The value the
client sent in the host-name option.</p>

<p>host handle examine the host declaration associated with
this lease, if any.</p>

<p>subnet handle examine the subnet object associated with
this lease (the subnet object is not currently
supported).</p>

<p>pool handle examine the pool object associated with this
lease (the pool object is not currently supported).</p>

<p>billing-class handle examine the handle to the class to
which this lease is currently billed, if any (the class
object is not currently supported).</p>

<p>hardware-address data examine, update the hardware
address (chaddr) field sent by the client when it acquired
its lease.</p>

<p>hardware-type integer examine, update the type of the
network interface that the client reported when it acquired
its lease.</p>

<p>ends time examine the time when the lease s current
state ends, as understood by the client.</p>

<p>tstp time examine the time when the lease s current
state ends, as understood by the server. tsfp time examine
the adjusted time when the leases current state ends, as
under- stood by the failover peer (if there is no failover
peer, this value is undefined). Generally this value is only
adjusted for expired, released, or reset leases while the
server is operating in partner-down state, and otherwise is
simply the value supplied by the peer. atsfp time examine
the actual tsfp value sent from the peer. This value is
forgotten when a lease binding state change is made, to
facilitate retrans- mission logic.</p>

<p>cltt time examine The time of the last transaction with
the client on this lease.</p>

<p>THE HOST OBJECT Hosts can be created, destroyed, looked
up, examined and modified. If a host declaration is created
or deleted using OMAPI, that information will be recorded in
the dhcpd.leases file. It is permissible to delete host
declarations that are declared in the dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p>Hosts have the following attributes:</p>

<p>name data lookup, examine, modify the name of the host
declaration. This name must be unique among all host
declarations.</p>

<p>group handle examine, modify the named group associated
with the host declaration, if there is one.</p>

<p>hardware-address data lookup, examine, modify the
link-layer address that will be used to match the client, if
any. Only valid if hardware-type is also present.</p>

<p>hardware-type integer lookup, examine, modify the type
of the network interface that will be used to match the
client, if any. Only valid if hardware-address is also
present.</p>

<p>dhcp-client-identifier data lookup, examine, modify the
dhcp-client-identifier option that will be used to match the
client, if any.</p>

<p>ip-address data examine, modify a fixed IP address which
is reserved for a DHCP client that matches this host
declaration. The IP address will only be assigned to the
client if it is valid for the network segment to which the
client is connected.</p>

<p>statements data modify a list of statements in the
format of the dhcpd.conf file that will be executed whenever
a message from the client is being pro- cessed.</p>

<p>known integer examine, modify if nonzero, indicates that
a client matching this host declaration will be treated as
known in pool permit lists. If zero, the client will not be
treated as known.</p>

<p>THE GROUP OBJECT Named groups can be created, destroyed,
looked up, examined and modi- fied. If a group declaration
is created or deleted using OMAPI, that information will be
recorded in the dhcpd.leases file. It is permissi- ble to
delete group declarations that are declared in the
dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p>Named groups currently can only be associated with hosts
- this allows one set of statements to be efficiently
attached to more than one host declaration.</p>

<p>Groups have the following attributes:</p>

<p>name data the name of the group. All groups that are
created using OMAPI must have names, and the names must be
unique among all groups.</p>

<p>statements data a list of statements in the format of
the dhcpd.conf file that will be executed whenever a message
from a client whose host dec- laration references this group
is processed.</p>

<p>THE CONTROL OBJECT The control object allows you to shut
the server down. If the server is doing failover with
another peer, it will make a clean transition into the
shutdown state and notify its peer, so that the peer can go
into partner down, and then record the &quot;recover&quot;
state in the lease file so that when the server is
restarted, it will automatically resyn- chronize with its
peer.</p>

<p>On shutdown the server will also attempt to cleanly shut
down all OMAPI connections. If these connections do not go
down cleanly after five seconds, they are shut down
preemptively. It can take as much as 25 seconds from the
beginning of the shutdown process to the time that the
server actually exits.</p>

<p>To shut the server down, open its control object and set
the state attribute to 2.</p>

<p>THE FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT The failover-state object is
the object that tracks the state of the failover protocol as
it is being managed for a given failover peer. The failover
object has the following attributes (please see dhcpd.conf
(5) for explanations about what these attributes mean):</p>

<p>name data examine Indicates the name of the failover
peer relationship, as described in the servers dhcpd.conf
file.</p>

<p>partner-address data examine Indicates the failover
partners IP address.</p>

<p>local-address data examine Indicates the IP address that
is being used by the DHCP server for this failover pair.</p>

<p>partner-port data examine Indicates the TCP port on
which the failover partner is listening for failover
protocol connections.</p>

<p>local-port data examine Indicates the TCP port on which
the DHCP server is listening for failover protocol
connections for this failover pair.</p>

<p>max-outstanding-updates integer examine Indicates the
number of updates that can be outstanding and unac-
knowledged at any given time, in this failover
relationship.</p>

<p>mclt integer examine Indicates the maximum client lead
time in this failover relation- ship.</p>

<p>load-balance-max-secs integer examine Indicates the
maximum value for the secs field in a client request before
load balancing is bypassed.</p>

<p>load-balance-hba data examine Indicates the load
balancing hash bucket array for this failover
relationship.</p>

<p>local-state integer examine, modify Indicates the
present state of the DHCP server in this failover
relationship. Possible values for state are:</p>

<p>1 - startup 2 - normal 3 - communications interrupted 4
- partner down 5 - potential conflict 6 - recover 7 - paused
8 - shutdown 9 - recover done 10 - resolution interrupted 11
- conflict done 254 - recover wait</p>

<p>(Note that some of the above values have changed since
DHCP 3.0.x.)</p>

<p>In general it is not a good idea to make changes to this
state. However, in the case that the failover partner is
known to be down, it can be useful to set the DHCP server s
failover state to partner down. At this point the DHCP
server will take over ser- vice of the failover partners
leases as soon as possible, and will give out normal leases,
not leases that are restricted by MCLT. If you do put the
DHCP server into the partner-down when the other DHCP server
is not in the partner-down state, but is not reachable, IP
address assignment conflicts are possible, even likely. Once
a server has been put into partner-down mode, its failover
partner must not be brought back online until communica-
tion is possible between the two servers.</p>

<p>partner-state integer examine Indicates the present
state of the failover partner.</p>

<p>local-stos integer examine Indicates the time at which
the DHCP server entered its present state in this failover
relationship.</p>

<p>partner-stos integer examine Indicates the time at which
the failover partner entered its present state.</p>

<p>hierarchy integer examine Indicates whether the DHCP
server is primary (0) or secondary (1) in this failover
relationship.</p>

<p>last-packet-sent integer examine Indicates the time at
which the most recent failover packet was sent by this DHCP
server to its failover partner.</p>

<p>last-timestamp-received integer examine Indicates the
timestamp that was on the failover message most recently
received from the failover partner.</p>

<p>skew integer examine Indicates the skew between the
failover partners clock and this DHCP servers clock</p>

<p>max-response-delay integer examine Indicates the time in
seconds after which, if no message is received from the
failover partner, the partner is assumed to be out of
communication.</p>

<p>cur-unacked-updates integer examine Indicates the number
of update messages that have been received from the failover
partner but not yet processed.</p>
