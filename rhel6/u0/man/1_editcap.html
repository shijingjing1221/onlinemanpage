<p>EDITCAP(1) The Wireshark Network Analyzer EDITCAP(1)</p>

<p>NAME editcap - Edit and/or translate the format of
capture files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS editcap [ -c &lt;packets per file&gt; ] [ -C
&lt;choplen&gt; ] [ -E &lt;error probability&gt; ] [ -F
&lt;file format&gt; ] [ -A &lt;start time&gt; ] [ -B
&lt;stop time&gt; ] [ -h ] [ -i &lt;seconds per file&gt; ] [
-r ] [ -s &lt;snaplen&gt; ] [ -t &lt;time adjustment&gt; ] [
-T &lt;encapsulation type&gt; ] [ -v ] infile outfile [
packet#[-packet#] ... ]</p>

<p>editcap -d | -D &lt;dup window&gt; | -w &lt;dup time
window&gt; [ -v ] infile outfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Editcap is a program that reads some or all
of the captured packets from the infile, optionally converts
them in various ways and writes the resulting packets to the
capture outfile (or outfiles).</p>

<p>By default, it reads all packets from the infile and
writes them to the outfile in libpcap file format.</p>

<p>An optional list of packet numbers can be specified on
the command tail; individual packet numbers separated by
whitespace and/or ranges of packet numbers can be specified
as start-end, referring to all packets from start to end. By
default the selected packets with those numbers will not be
written to the capture file. If the -r flag is specified,
the whole packet selection is reversed; in that case only
the selected packets will be written to the capture
file.</p>

<p>Editcap can also be used to remove duplicate packets.
Several different options (-d, -D and -w) are used to
control the packet window or relative time window to be used
for duplicate comparison.</p>

<p>Editcap is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by Wireshark. The input
file doesnt need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip compression will be
automatically detected. Near the beginning of the
DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
&lt;http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html&gt;
is a detailed description of the way Wireshark handles this,
which is the same way Editcap handles this.</p>

<p>Editcap can write the file in several output formats.
The -F flag can be used to specify the format in which to
write the capture file; editcap -F provides a list of the
available output formats.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c &lt;packets per file&gt; Splits the packet
output to different files based on uniform packet counts
with a maximum of &lt;packets per file&gt; each. Each output
file will be created with a suffix -nnnnn, starting with
00000. If the specified number of packets is written to the
output file, the next output file is opened. The default is
to use a single output file.</p>

<p>-C &lt;choplen&gt; Sets the chop length to use when
writing the packet data. Each packet is chopped at the
packet end by a few &lt;choplen&gt; bytes of data.</p>

<p>This is useful in the rare case that the conversion
between two file formats leaves some random bytes at the end
of each packet.</p>

<p>-d Attempts to remove duplicate packets. The length and
MD5 hash of the current packet are compared to the previous
four (4) packets. If a match is found, the current packet is
skipped. This option is equivalent to using the option -D
5.</p>

<p>-D &lt;dup window&gt; Attempts to remove duplicate
packets. The length and MD5 hash of the current packet are
compared to the previous &lt;dup window&gt; - 1 packets. If
a match is found, the current packet is skipped.</p>

<p>The use of the option -D 0 combined with the -v option
is useful in that each packets Packet number, Len and MD5
Hash will be printed to standard out. This verbose output
(specifically the MD5 hash strings) can be useful in scripts
to identify duplicate packets across trace files.</p>

<p>The &lt;dup window&gt; is specifed as an integer value
between 0 and 1000000 (inclusive).</p>

<p>NOTE: Specifying large &lt;dup window&gt; values with
large tracefiles can result in very long processing times
for editcap.</p>

<p>-w &lt;dup time window&gt; Attempts to remove duplicate
packets. The current packets arrival time is compared with
up to 1000000 previous packets. If the packets relative
arrival time is less than or equal to the &lt;dup time
window&gt; of a previous packet and the packet length and
MD5 hash of the current packet are the same then the packet
to skipped. The duplicate comparison test stops when the
current packets relative arrival time is greater than
&lt;dup time window&gt;.</p>

<p>The &lt;dup time window&gt; is specifed as
seconds[.fractional seconds].</p>

<p>The [.fractional seconds] component can be specified to
nine (9) decimal places (billionths of a second) but most
typical trace files have resolution to six (6) decimal
places (millionths of a second).</p>

<p>NOTE: Specifying large &lt;dup time window&gt; values
with large tracefiles can result in very long processing
times for editcap.</p>

<p>NOTE: The -w option assumes that the packets are in
chronological order. If the packets are NOT in chronological
order then the -w duplication removal option may not
identify some duplicates.</p>

<p>-E &lt;error probability&gt; Sets the probabilty that
bytes in the output file are randomly changed. Editcap uses
that probability (between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive) to apply
errors to each data byte in the file. For instance, a
probability of 0.02 means that each byte has a 2% chance of
having an error.</p>

<p>This option is meant to be used for fuzz-testing
protocol dissectors.</p>

<p>-F &lt;file format&gt; Sets the file format of the
output capture file. Editcap can write the file in several
formats, editcap -F provides a list of the available output
formats. The default is the libpcap format.</p>

<p>-A &lt;start time&gt; Saves only the packets whose
timestamp is on or after start time. The time is given in
the following format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</p>

<p>-B &lt;stop time&gt; Saves only the packets whose
timestamp is on or before stop time. The time is given in
the following format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</p>

<p>-h Prints the version and options and exits.</p>

<p>-i &lt;seconds per file&gt; Splits the packet output to
different files based on uniform time intervals using a
maximum interval of &lt;seconds per file&gt; each. Each
output file will be created with a suffix -nnnnn, starting
with 00000. If packets for the specified time interval are
written to the output file, the next output file is opened.
The default is to use a single output file.</p>

<p>-r Reverse the packet selection. Causes the packets
whose packet numbers are specified on the command line to be
written to the output capture file, instead of discarding
them.</p>

<p>-s &lt;snaplen&gt; Sets the snapshot length to use when
writing the data. If the -s flag is used to specify a
snapshot length, packets in the input file with more
captured data than the specified snapshot length will have
only the amount of data specified by the snapshot length
written to the output file.</p>

<p>This may be useful if the program that is to read the
output file cannot handle packets larger than a certain size
(for example, the versions of snoop in Solaris 2.5.1 and
Solaris 2.6 appear to reject Ethernet packets larger than
the standard Ethernet MTU, making them incapable of handling
gigabit Ethernet captures if jumbo packets were used).</p>

<p>-t &lt;time adjustment&gt; Sets the time adjustment to
use on selected packets. If the -t flag is used to specify a
time adjustment, the specified adjustment will be applied to
all selected packets in the capture file. The adjustment is
specified as [-]seconds[.fractional seconds]. For example,
-t 3600 advances the timestamp on selected packets by one
hour while -t -0.5 reduces the timestamp on selected packets
by one-half second.</p>

<p>This feature is useful when synchronizing dumps
collected on different machines where the time difference
between the two machines is known or can be estimated.</p>

<p>-T &lt;encapsulation type&gt; Sets the packet
encapsulation type of the output capture file. If the -T
flag is used to specify an encapsulation type, the
encapsulation type of the output capture file will be forced
to the specified type. editcap -T provides a list of the
available types. The default type is the one appropriate to
the encapsulation type of the input capture file.</p>

<p>Note: this merely forces the encapsulation type of the
output file to be the specified type; the packet headers of
the packets will not be translated from the encapsulation
type of the input capture file to the specified
encapsulation type (for example, it will not translate an
Ethernet capture to an FDDI capture if an Ethernet capture
is read and -T fddi is specified). If you need to remove/add
headers from/to a packet, you will need
od(1)/text2pcap(1).</p>

<p>-v Causes editcap to print verbose messages while its
working.</p>

<p>Use of -v with the de-duplication switches of -d, -D or
-w will cause all MD5 hashes to be printed whether the
packet is skipped or not.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see more detailed description of the options
use:</p>

<p>editcap -h</p>

<p>To shrink the capture file by truncating the packets at
64 bytes and writing it as Sun snoop file use:</p>

<p>editcap -s 64 -F snoop capture.pcap
shortcapture.snoop</p>

<p>To delete packet 1000 from the capture file use:</p>

<p>editcap capture.pcap sans1000.pcap 1000</p>

<p>To limit a capture file to packets from number 200 to
750 (inclusive) use:</p>

<p>editcap -r capture.pcap small.pcap 200-750</p>

<p>To get all packets from number 1-500 (inclusive)
use:</p>

<p>editcap -r capture.pcap first500.pcap 1-500</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>editcap capture.pcap first500.pcap 501-9999999</p>

<p>To exclude packets 1, 5, 10 to 20 and 30 to 40 from the
new file use:</p>

<p>editcap capture.pcap exclude.pcap 1 5 10-20 30-40</p>

<p>To select just packets 1, 5, 10 to 20 and 30 to 40 for
the new file use:</p>

<p>editcap -r capture.pcap select.pcap 1 5 10-20 30-40</p>

<p>To remove duplicate packets seen within the prior four
frames use:</p>

<p>editcap -d capture.pcap dedup.pcap</p>

<p>To remove duplicate packets seen within the prior 100
frames use:</p>

<p>editcap -D 101 capture.pcap dedup.pcap</p>

<p>To remove duplicate packets seen equal to or less than
1/10th of a second:</p>

<p>editcap -w 0.1 capture.pcap dedup.pcap</p>

<p>To display the MD5 hash for all of the packets (and NOT
generate any real output file):</p>

<p>editcap -v -D 0 capture.pcap /dev/null</p>

<p>or on Windows systems</p>

<p>editcap -v -D 0 capture.pcap NUL</p>

<p>To introduce 5% random errors in a capture file use:</p>

<p>editcap -E 0.05 capture.pcap capture_error.pcap</p>
