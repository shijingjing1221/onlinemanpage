<p>Tk_MeasureChars(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_MeasureChars(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_MeasureChars, Tk_TextWidth, Tk_DrawChars,
Tk_UnderlineChars - rou- tines to measure and display simple
single-line strings.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_MeasureChars(tkfont, string, numBytes, maxPixels,
flags, lengthPtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_TextWidth(tkfont, string, numBytes)</p>

<p>Tk_DrawChars(display, drawable, gc, tkfont, string,
numBytes, x, y)</p>

<p>Tk_UnderlineChars(display, drawable, gc, tkfont, string,
x, y, firstByte, lastByte)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Font tkfont (in) Token for font in which
text is to be drawn or measured. Must have been returned by
a previous call to Tk_GetFont.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Text to be measured or
displayed. Need not be null terminated. Any non-printing
meta-characters in the string (such as tabs, newlines, and
other control characters) will be measured or displayed in a
platform- dependent manner.</p>

<p>int numBytes (in) The maximum number of bytes to con-
sider when measuring or drawing string. Must be greater than
or equal to 0.</p>

<p>int maxPixels (in) If maxPixels is &gt;= 0, it specifies
the longest permissible line length in pixels. Characters
from string are processed only until this many pixels have
been covered. If max- Pixels is &lt; 0, then the line length
is unbounded and the flags argument is ignored.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Various flag bits OR-ed together:
TK_PARTIAL_OK means include a char- acter as long as any
part of it fits in the length given by maxPixels; otherwise,
a character must fit com- pletely to be considered.
TK_WHOLE_WORDS means stop on a word boundary, if possible.
If TK_AT_LEAST_ONE is set, it means return at least one
character even if no characters could fit in the length
given by maxPixels. If TK_AT_LEAST_ONE is set and
TK_WHOLE_WORDS is also set, it means that if not even one
word fits on the line, return the first few let- ters of the
word that did fit; if not even one letter of the word fit,
then the first letter will still be returned.</p>

<p>int *lengthPtr (out) Filled with the number of pixels
occupied by the number of characters returned as the result
of Tk_Mea- sureChars.</p>

<p>Display *display (in) Display on which to draw.</p>

<p>Drawable drawable (in) Window or pixmap in which to
draw.</p>

<p>GC gc (in) Graphics context for drawing charac- ters.
The font selected into this GC must be the same as the
tkfont.</p>

<p>int x, y (in) Coordinates at which to place the left
edge of the baseline when dis- playing string.</p>

<p>int firstByte (in) The index of the first byte of the
first character to underline in the string. Underlining
begins at the left edge of this character.</p>

<p>int lastByte (in) The index of the first byte of the
last character up to which the underline will be drawn. The
char- acter specified by lastByte will not itself be
underlined.

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines are for measuring and
displaying simple single-font, single-line strings. To
measure and display single-font, multi-line, justified text,
refer to the documentation for Tk_ComputeTextLayout. There
is no programming interface in the core of Tk that supports
multi-font, multi-line text; support for that behavior must
be built on top of simpler layers. Note that the interfaces
described here are byte-oriented not character-oriented, so
index values coming from Tcl scripts need to be converted to
byte offsets using the Tcl_UtfAtIndex and related
routines.</p>

<p>A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number,
or some other symbol. Not all character codes in a given
font have a glyph. Charac- ters such as tabs,
newlines/returns, and control characters that have no glyph
are measured and displayed by these procedures in a
platform- dependent manner; under X, they are replaced with
backslashed escape sequences, while under Windows and
Macintosh hollow or solid boxes may be substituted. Refer to
the documentation for Tk_ComputeTextLayout for a programming
interface that supports the platform-independent expansion
of tab characters into columns and newlines/returns into
multi-line text.</p>

<p>Tk_MeasureChars is used both to compute the length of a
given string and to compute how many characters from a
string fit in a given amount of space. The return value is
the number of bytes from string that fit in the space
specified by maxPixels subject to the conditions described
by flags. If all characters fit, the return value will be
numBytes. *lengthPtr is filled with the computed width, in
pixels, of the portion of the string that was measured. For
example, if the return value is 5, then *lengthPtr is filled
with the distance between the left edge of string[0] and the
right edge of string[4].</p>

<p>Tk_TextWidth is a wrapper function that provides a
simpler interface to the Tk_MeasureChars function. The
return value is how much space in pixels the given string
needs.</p>

<p>Tk_DrawChars draws the string at the given location in
the given draw- able.</p>

<p>Tk_UnderlineChars underlines the given range of
characters in the given string. It does not draw the
characters (which are assumed to have been displayed
previously by Tk_DrawChars); it just draws the under- line.
This procedure is used to underline a few characters without
having to construct an underlined font. To produce natively
underlined text, the appropriate underlined font should be
constructed and used.</p>
