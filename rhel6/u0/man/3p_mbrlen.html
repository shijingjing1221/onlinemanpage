<p>MBRLEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBRLEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbrlen - get number of bytes in a character
(restartable)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbrlen(const char *restrict s, size_t n,
mbstate_t *restrict ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is not a null pointer, mbrlen() shall
determine the number of bytes constituting the character
pointed to by s. It shall be equiva- lent to:</p>

<p>mbstate_t internal; mbrtowc(NULL, s, n, ps != NULL ? ps
: &amp;internal);</p>

<p>If ps is a null pointer, the mbrlen() function shall use
its own inter- nal mbstate_t object, which is initialized at
program start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise,
the mbstate_t object pointed to by ps shall be used to
completely describe the current conversion state of the
associated character sequence. The implementation shall
behave as if no function defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 calls mbrlen().</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbrlen() function shall return the
first of the following that applies:</p>

<p>0 If the next n or fewer bytes complete the character
that corre- sponds to the null wide character.</p>

<p>positive If the next n or fewer bytes complete a valid
character; the value returned shall be the number of bytes
that complete the character.</p>

<p>(size_t)-2 If the next n bytes contribute to an
incomplete but potentially valid character, and all n bytes
have been processed. When n has at least the value of the
{MB_CUR_MAX} macro, this case can only occur if s points at
a sequence of redundant shift sequences (for implementations
with state-dependent encodings).</p>

<p>(size_t)-1 If an encoding error occurs, in which case
the next n or fewer bytes do not contribute to a complete
and valid character. In this case, [EILSEQ] shall be stored
in errno and the conversion state is undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mbrlen() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL ps points to an object that contains an invalid
conversion state.</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.</p>
