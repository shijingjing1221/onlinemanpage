<p>NAME CMPIStatus - CMPIStatus class implementation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Public Attributes CMPIrc rc; status code for
operation. CMPIString * msg; String description for status
code, when errors occur.</p>

<p>METHODS DESCRIPTION Native CMPIStatus
implementation.</p>

<p>This is the native CMPIStatus implementation as used for
remote providers. It reflects the well-defined interface of
a regular CMPISta- tus object, however, it works
independently from the management broker.</p>

<p>It is part of a native broker implementation that
simulates CMPI data types rather than interacting with the
entities in a full-grown CIMOM.</p>

(CMPI) - OpenGroup</p>
