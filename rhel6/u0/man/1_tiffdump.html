<p>NAME tiffdump - print verbatim information about TIFF
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiffdump [ options ] name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tiffdump displays directory information from
files created according to the Tag Image File Format,
Revision 6.0. The header of each TIFF file (magic number,
version, and first directory offset) is displayed, fol-
lowed by the tag contents of each directory in the file. For
each tag, the name, data type, count, and value(s) is
displayed. When the sym- bolic name for a tag or data type
is known, the symbolic name is dis- played followed by its
numeric (decimal) value. Tag values are dis- played enclosed
in &lt;&gt; characters immediately preceded by the value of
the count field. For example, an ImageWidth tag might be
displayed as ImageWidth (256) SHORT (3) 1&lt;800&gt;.</p>

<p>tiffdump is particularly useful for investigating the
contents of TIFF files that libtiff does not understand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Force numeric data to be printed in
hexadecimal rather than the default decimal.</p>

<p>-m items Change the number of indirect data items that
are printed. By default, this will be 24.</p>

<p>-o offset Dump the contents of the IFD at the a
particular file offset. The file offset may be specified
using the usual C-style syntax; i.e. a leading 0x for
hexadecimal and a leading 0 for octal.</p>
