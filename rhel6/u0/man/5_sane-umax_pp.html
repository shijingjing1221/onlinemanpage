<p>sane-umax_pp(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-umax_pp(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-umax_pp - SANE backend for Umax Astra parallel
port flatbed scan- ners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-umax_pp library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Umax parallel port flatbed scanners. The following scanners
work with this backend:</p>

<p>Model: -------------------- Astra 610P Astra 1220P
HP3200C Astra 1600P Astra 2000P Genius ColorPage-Life
Pro</p>

<p>This backend handles 75x75, 150x150, 300x300, 600x600
and 600x1200 for 1220P/1600P/2000P dpi scan reslutions,and
75x75, 150x150, 300x300 and 300x600 for 610P. In color and
gray levels, there is a software lineart mode.</p>

<p>The new generation models share a newer version of the
610P ASIC embed- ded in an EPAT chip. Only parts such as CCD
and ADC change from one to another. They even all reports
being UMAX Astra 1220P via IEEE1284. There isn t software
way to recognize them properly. Under windows, model is set
by the driver installed, regardless of the hardware.</p>

<p>EPP/ECP MODES ONLY The current version of the backend
uses only EPP or ECP mode to communicate with the scanner.
PS/2 mode isn t implemented. The 610P only use SPP. It is
recommended that you set your parallel port to EPP in BIOS
with the current version of this backend. You can leave it
to ECP or ECP+EPP, but in this case you may not use ppdev
but only direct hardware access if you have to use ECP.
ECPEPP will only work if you use a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with
ppdev character device support.</p>

<p>This backend does support parport sharing only if you
have a kernel with ppdev support.</p>

<p>Note that if you dont use the ppdev character device,
the backend needs to run as root. To allow user access to
the scanner run the back- end through the network interface
(See saned(8) and sane-net(5)). A more relaxed solution
(security wise) is to add suid bit to the fron- tend (See
chmod(1)). The backend drop root priviledges as soon as it
can, right after gaining direct access to IO ports, which
lessen risks when being root.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>port value</p>

<p>Where value is :</p>

<p>auto autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for
scanner</p>

<p>safe-auto autodetect all parallel ports and probe them
for scanner, but does not try direct hardware access</p>

<p>/dev/ppi0 uses *BSD ppi device, depending on the number
of avail- able parallel port, you have to use /dev/ppi1,
/dev/ppi2, ...</p>

<p>/dev/parport0 uses linux ppdev device, depending on the
number of available parallel port, you have to use
/dev/parport1, /dev/parport2, ...</p>

<p>0x378 does direct hardware access on the given address.
Usual values are 0x378, 0x278, 0x3BC In this case, you have
to run the scanner as root (*BSD and linux), or with
IOPL=yes on OS/2</p>

<p>NOTE: in all cases, you must have sufficient priviledges
to get access to the chosen device or address. Depending on
the security settings, devices may not be available for all
users. You have to change permis- sions on the dev/ppi* or
/dev/parport* devices.</p>

<p>You can rename any device using the</p>

<p>name devname model model vendor vendor</p>

<p>options. These options apply to the last port
option.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Please make sure to edit umax_pp.conf
before you use the backend.</p>

<p>The contents of the umax_pp.conf file is a list of
options and device names that correspond to Umax scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored.</p>

<p>The eight options supported are red-gain, green-gain,
blue-gain, red-offset, green-offset, blue-offset, astra, and
buffer.</p>

<p>Options red-gain , green-gain and blue-gain allow you to
adjust the sensitivy of your scanner for the given color.
Values range from 0 (lowest gain) to 15 (highest). If the
advanced option &quot;Gain&quot; isnt checked in the
frontend, the backend does automatic gain calibration, and
do not use user provided values.</p>

<p>Options red-offset , green-offset and blue-offset allow
you to adjust the offset of your scanner for the given
color. Values range from 0 (lowest offset) to 15
(highest).</p>

<p>Option astra allows you to change the model of your
scanner. Current auto detection is based on side effects on
scanning when using 1220P command set on other models, so it
may fail on unkown hardware combina- tion. Valid values are
610, 1220, 1600 and 2000. It is usefull only when
autodetection fails to detect properly your scanner model.
If your scanner work properly but is reported wrongly, let
it be that way. The only valid case to change the model is
when your scanner produces &quot;black&quot; or
&quot;inverted&quot; scans. In this case you can put the
model. Be aware that it will prevent scanner model
autodetection.</p>

<p>Option buffer allows you to change the size of the scan
buffer. The size must be specified in bytes. The default
value is 2 megabytes. Decreasing this value will improve the
smoothness of progress bar in the frontend, but will stall
the scan more often.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/umax_pp.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-umax_pp.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-umax_pp.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128
requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>level debug output -------
------------------------------ 0 nothing 1 errors 2 warnings
&amp; minor errors 3 additional information 4 debug
information 5 code flow (not supported yet) 6 special debug
information</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP_LOW This variable sets the debug
level for the SANE interface for the Umax ASIC. Note that
enabling this will spam your terminal with some million
lines of debug output.</p>

<p>level debug output -------
------------------------------- 0 nothing 1 errors 8 command
blocks 16 detailed code flow 32 dump datafiles 255
everything</p>

<p>CREDITS Support for the 610P has been made possible
thank to an hardware dona- tion by William Stuart.</p>

<p>BUG REPORTS If something doesnt work, please contact me.
But I need some informa- tion about your scanner to be able
to help you...</p>

<p>SANE version run &quot;scanimage -V&quot; to determine
this</p>

<p>the backend version and your scanner hardware run
&quot;SANE_DEBUG_UMAX_PP=255 scanimage -L 2&gt;log&quot; as
root. If you dont get any output from the umax_pp backend,
make sure a line &quot;umax_pp&quot; is included into your
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf. If your scanner isnt detected, make
sure youve defined the right port address, or the correct
device in your umax_pp.conf.</p>

<p>the name of your scanner/vendor also a worthy
information. Please also include the optical reso- lution
and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the
manual of your scanner.</p>

<p>any further comments if you have comments about the
documentation (what could be done better), or you think I
should know something, please include it.</p>
