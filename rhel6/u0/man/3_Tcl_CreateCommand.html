<p>Tcl_CreateCommand(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_CreateCommand(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CreateCommand - implement new commands in C</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Command Tcl_CreateCommand(interp, cmdName, proc,
clientData, deleteProc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to create new command.</p>

<p>const char *cmdName (in) Name of command.</p>

<p>Tcl_CmdProc *proc (in) Implementation of new com- mand:
proc will be called whenever cmdName is invoked as a
command.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc and deleteProc.</p>

<p>Tcl_CmdDeleteProc *deleteProc (in) Procedure to call
before cmdName is deleted from the interpreter; allows for
command-specific cleanup. If NULL, then no procedure is
called before the com- mand is deleted.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CreateCommand defines a new command in
interp and associates it with procedure proc such that
whenever cmdName is invoked as a Tcl com- mand (via a call
to Tcl_Eval) the Tcl interpreter will call proc to process
the command. It differs from Tcl_CreateObjCommand in that a
new string-based command is defined; that is, a command
procedure is defined that takes an array of argument strings
instead of objects. The object-based command procedures
registered by Tcl_CreateObjCommand can execute significantly
faster than the string-based command proce- dures defined by
Tcl_CreateCommand. This is because they take Tcl objects as
arguments and those objects can retain an internal represen-
tation that can be manipulated more efficiently. Also, Tcls
inter- preter now uses objects internally. In order to
invoke a string-based command procedure registered by
Tcl_CreateCommand, it must generate and fetch a string
representation from each argument object before the call and
create a new Tcl object to hold the string result returned
by the string-based command procedure. New commands should
be defined using Tcl_CreateObjCommand. We support
Tcl_CreateCommand for backwards com- patibility.</p>

<p>The procedures Tcl_DeleteCommand, Tcl_GetCommandInfo,
and Tcl_SetCom- mandInfo are used in conjunction with
Tcl_CreateCommand.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateCommand will delete an existing command
cmdName, if one is already associated with the interpreter.
It returns a token that may be used to refer to the command
in subsequent calls to Tcl_GetCommandName. If cmdName
contains any :: namespace qualifiers, then the command is
added to the specified namespace; otherwise the command is
added to the global namespace. If Tcl_CreateCommand is
called for an interpreter that is in the process of being
deleted, then it does not create a new command and it
returns NULL. Proc should have arguments and result that
match the type Tcl_CmdProc: typedef int Tcl_CmdProc(
ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp, int argc, const
char *argv[]); When proc is invoked the clientData and
interp parameters will be copies of the clientData and
interp arguments given to Tcl_CreateCom- mand. Typically,
clientData points to an application-specific data structure
that describes what to do when the command procedure is
invoked. Argc and argv describe the arguments to the
command, argc giving the number of arguments (including the
command name) and argv giving the values of the arguments as
strings. The argv array will contain argc+1 values; the
first argc values point to the argument strings, and the
last value is NULL. Note that the argument strings should
not be modified as they may point to constant strings or may
be shared with other parts of the interpreter.</p>

<p>Note that the argument strings are encoded in normalized
UTF-8 since version 8.1 of Tcl.</p>

<p>Proc must return an integer code that is expected to be
one of TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR, TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, or
TCL_CONTINUE. See the Tcl overview man page for details on
what these codes mean. Most normal commands will only return
TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR. In addition, proc must set the
interpreter result to point to a string value; in the case
of a TCL_OK return code this gives the result of the
command, and in the case of TCL_ERROR it gives an error
message. The Tcl_SetResult proce- dure provides an easy
interface for setting the return value; for com- plete
details on how the interpreter result field is managed, see
the Tcl_Interp man page. Before invoking a command
procedure, Tcl_Eval sets the interpreter result to point to
an empty string, so simple com- mands can return an empty
result by doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>The contents of the argv array belong to Tcl and are not
guaranteed to persist once proc returns: proc should not
modify them, nor should it set the interpreter result to
point anywhere within the argv values. Call Tcl_SetResult
with status TCL_VOLATILE if you want to return some- thing
from the argv array.</p>

<p>DeleteProc will be invoked when (if) cmdName is deleted.
This can occur through a call to Tcl_DeleteCommand or
Tcl_DeleteInterp, or by replacing cmdName in another call to
Tcl_CreateCommand. DeleteProc is invoked before the command
is deleted, and gives the application an opportunity to
release any structures associated with the command.
DeleteProc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tcl_CmdDeleteProc: typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(
ClientData clientData); The clientData argument will be the
same as the clientData argument passed to
Tcl_CreateCommand.</p>
