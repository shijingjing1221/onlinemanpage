<p>NAME pgmenhance - edge-enhance a PGM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmenhance</p>

<p>[-N]</p>

<p>[pgmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmenhance reads a PGM image as input, enhances the
edges, and writes a PGM image as output.</p>

<p>The edge enhancing technique is taken from Philip R.
Thompsons xim program, which in turn took it from section 6
of Digital Halftones by Dot Diffusion , D. E. Knuth, ACM
Transaction on Graphics Vol. 6, No. 4, October 1987, which
in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J. F. Jarvis et.
al.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The optional -N option should be a digit from 1
to 9. 1 is the lowest level of enhancement; 9 is the
highest. The default is 9.</p>
