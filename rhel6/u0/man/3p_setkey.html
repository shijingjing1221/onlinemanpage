<p>SETKEY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETKEY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setkey - set encoding key (CRYPT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void setkey(const char *key);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setkey() function provides access to an
implementation-defined encoding algorithm. The argument of
setkey() is an array of length 64 bytes containing only the
bytes with numerical value of 0 and 1. If this string is
divided into groups of 8, the low-order bit in each group is
ignored; this gives a 56-bit key which is used by the algo-
rithm. This is the key that shall be used with the algorithm
to encode a string block passed to encrypt().</p>

<p>The setkey() function shall not change the setting of
errno if success- ful. An application wishing to check for
error situations should set errno to 0 before calling
setkey(). If errno is non-zero on return, an error has
occurred.</p>

<p>The setkey() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE No values are returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setkey() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOSYS The functionality is not supported on this
implementation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Decoding need not be implemented in
all environments. This is related to government restrictions
in some countries on encryption and decryp- tion routines.
Historical practice has been to ship a different version of
the encryption library without the decryption feature in the
rou- tines supplied. Thus the exported version of encrypt()
does encoding but not decoding.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
