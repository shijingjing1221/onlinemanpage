<p>sane-qcam(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-qcam(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-qcam - SANE backend for Connectix QuickCam
cameras</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-qcam library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access
Connectix QuickCam cameras.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>port</p>

<p>Where port is the I/O port address at which the device
resides. This address is normally specified in hexadecimal
using C syntax (e.g., 0x37b) and may be prefixed with the
letter &quot;u&quot; (e.g., u0x37b) to force the backend to
access the camera in uni-directional mode.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the qcam.conf file is a
list port addresses that may be connected to a Connectix
QuickCam. Empty lines and everything starting from a hash
mark (#) up to the end of a line are ignored. A sample
configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>0x37b # /dev/lp0 0x378 # /dev/lp1 u0x278 # /dev/lp2
forced in uni-directional mode 0x3bc # /dev/lp0 (alternate
address)</p>

<p>In general, it is safest to list only the port addresses
that really correspond to a QuickCam. For example, if one of
the listed addresses actually connect to a printer, then
starting up this backend will cause the printer to perform a
device reset (which is generally undesirable).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/qcam.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-qcam.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-qcam.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_QCAM If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS Support is currently limited to the color version
of the QuickCam. The black-and-white camera is starting to
work too, but I don t believe it works in all cases yet.
Reportedly, acquiring images of certain sizes work fine, but
others result in shifted images (sounds like a problem due
to byte-padding).</p>

<p>The program needs root-privileges since it needs to be
able to access the cameras I/O ports.</p>
