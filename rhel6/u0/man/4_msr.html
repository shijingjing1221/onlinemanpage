<p>NAME msr - x86 CPU MSR access device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides an interface to
read and write the model- specific registers (MSRs) of an
x86 CPU. CPUNUM is the number of the CPU to access as listed
in /proc/cpuinfo.</p>

<p>The register access is done by opening the file and
seeking to the MSR number as offset in the file, and then
reading or writing in chunks of 8 bytes. An I/O transfer of
more than 8 bytes means multiple reads or writes of the same
register.</p>

<p>This file is protected so that it can only be read and
written by the user root, or members of the group root.</p>

<p>NOTES The msr driver is not auto-loaded. On modular
kernels you might need to use the following command to load
it explicitly before use:</p>

<p>$ modprobe msr</p>

Architectures Software Developers Manual Volume 3B Appendix
