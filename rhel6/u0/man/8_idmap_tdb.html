<p>NAME idmap_tdb - Samba&acute;s idmap_tdb Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_tdb plugin is the default backend
used by winbindd for storing SID/uid/gid mapping tables.</p>

<p>In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is
an allocating backend: This means that it needs to allocate
new user and group IDs in order to create new mappings. The
allocator can be provided by the idmap_tdb backend itself or
by any other allocating backend like idmap_ldap or
idmap_tdb2. This is configured with the parameter idmap
alloc backend.</p>

<p>Note that in order for this (or any other allocating)
backend to function at all, the default backend needs to be
writeable. The ranges used for uid and gid allocation are
the default ranges configured by &quot;idmap uid&quot; and
&quot;idmap gid&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since there is only one global allocating
backend responsible for all domains using writeable idmap
backends, any explicitly configured domain with idmap
backend tdb should have the same range as the default range,
since it needs to use the global uid / gid allocator. See
the example below.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS range = low - high Defines the available
matching uid and gid range for which the backend is
authoritative. If the parameter is absent, Winbind fails
over to use the &quot;idmap uid&quot; and &quot;idmap
gid&quot; options from smb.conf.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows how tdb is used as a the
default idmap backend. It configures the idmap range through
the global options for all domains encountered. This same
range is used for uid/gid allocation.</p>

<p>[global] # &quot;idmap backend = tdb&quot; is redundant
here since it is the default idmap backend = tdb idmap uid =
1000000-2000000 idmap gid = 1000000-2000000</p>

<p>This (rather theoretical) example shows how tdb can be
used as the allocating backend while ldap is the default
backend used to store the mappings. It adds an explicit
configuration for some domain DOM1, that uses the tdb idmap
backend. Note that the same range as the default uid/gid
range is used, since the allocator has to serve both the
default backend and the explicitly configured domain
DOM1.</p>

<p>[global] idmap backend = ldap idmap uid =
1000000-2000000 idmap gid = 1000000-2000000 # use a
different uid/gid allocator: idmap alloc backend = tdb</p>

<p>idmap config DOM1 : backend = tdb idmap config DOM1 :
range = 1000000-2000000</p>

were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
