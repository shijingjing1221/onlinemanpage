<p>NAME giftopnm - convert a GIF file into a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS giftopnm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]
[-verbose] [-comments] [-image={N,all}] [-repair]
[-quitearly] [GIFfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This is a graphics format converter from the GIF format
to the PNM (i.e. PBM, PGM, or PPM) format.</p>

<p>If the image contains only black and maximally bright
white, the output is PBM. If the image contains more than
those two colors, but only grays, the output is PGM. If the
image contains other colors, the out- put is PPM.</p>

<p>A GIF image contains rectangular pixels. They all have
the same aspect ratio, but may not be square (its actually
quite unusual for them not to be square, but it could
happen). The pixels of a Netpbm image are always square.
Because of the engineering complexity to do otherwise,
giftopnm converts a GIF image to a Netpbm image pixel-for-
pixel. This means if the GIF pixels are not square, the
Netpbm output image has the wrong aspect ratio. In this
case, giftopnm issues an informational message telling you
to run pamscale to correct the out- put.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --alphaout=alpha-filename giftopnm creates a PGM
(portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel values
in the input image. If the input image doesn t contain an
alpha channel, the alpha-filename file con- tains all zero
(transparent) alpha values. If you dont specify --alphaout,
giftopnm does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
image has an alpha channel, giftopnm simply discards it.</p>

<p>If you specify - as the filename, giftopnm writes the
alpha out- put to Standard Output and discards the
image.</p>

<p>See pamcomp(1)foronewaytouse the alpha output file.</p>

<p>-verbose Produce verbose output about the GIF file
input.</p>

<p>-comments With this option, giftopnm issues messages
showing the GIF com- ments (A GIF89 stream can contain
comments in comment exten- sions).</p>

<p>By default, giftopnm ignores comment extensions.</p>

<p>-image={N,all} This option identifies which image from
the GIF stream you want. You can select either one image or
all the images. Select al the images with all. Select one
image by specifying its sequence number in the stream: 1, 2,
3, etc.</p>

<p>The default is just Image 1.</p>

<p>A GIF stream normally contains only one image, so you
dont need this option. But some streams, including animated
GIFs, have multiple images.</p>

<p>When you select multiple GIF images, the output is a PNM
stream with multiple images.</p>

<p>If you specify a single image, giftopnm must read and
partially validate the images before that in the stream. It
may or may not do the same for the images after it; see
-quitearly.</p>

<p>The all value was added in Netpbm 10.16 (June 2003).
Earlier giftopnm can extract only one image.</p>

<p>-repair This option makes giftopnm try to salvage what
it can from an invalid GIF input.</p>

<p>In particular, when giftopnm detects that the GIF input
is invalid so that it is impossible to determine what the
pixels are intended to be, it produces a single arbitrary
color for all further pixels in the image. giftopnm
processes the image from top to bottom, left to right, so
this means the bottommost pix- els will be this padding.</p>

<p>giftopnm issues warning messages when it salvages an
image in this way.</p>

<p>Without this option, giftopnm fails when it detects
invalid GIF input. Any output it produces is arbitrary, and
typically is not a valid PNM image.</p>

<p>It is fairly common for an image to be corrupted such
that is started off as a valid GIF, but had the end of the
file cut off. An interrupted network transfer tends to do
this. In this case, giftopnms salvage operation will produce
a valid PNM image of the proper dimensions, but with a
single arbitrary color for the pixels that were left out of
the file.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). From
10.32 through 10.37, giftopnm always fails if it detects
invalid GIF input. Before 10.32, it succeeds in the case of
a truncated image, and replaces the missing pixels with
arbitrary colors, not necessarily all the same (The
pre-10.32 behavior wasnt actually intended by the
design).</p>

<p>-quitearly This option makes giftopnm stop reading its
input file as soon as it has converted and output the images
from the input that you requested. By default, giftopnm
reads until the end of the GIF stream, ignoring any data
after the images you requested.</p>

<p>Two reasons not to use this option:</p>

<p>&middot; The input file is a pipe and the process that
is filling that pipe expects the pipe to take the entire
stream and will fail or get stuck if it doesnt.</p>

<p>&middot; You want to validate the entire GIF stream.</p>

<p>Two reasons to use this option:</p>

<p>&middot; It saves the time and other resources to read
the end of the stream.</p>

<p>&middot; There are errors in the end of the stream that
make giftopnm fail.</p>

<p>This option has no effect if you also specify
-image=all</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.35 (August 2006).
Before that, giftopnm always reads the entire stream.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS This does not correctly handle the Plain
Text Extension of the GIF89 standard, since I did not have
any example input files containing them.</p>

<p>LICENSE As a historical note, for a long time if you
used giftopnm, you were using a patent on the LZW
compression method which was owned by Unisys, and in all
probability you did not have a license from Unisys to do so.
Unisys typically asked $5000 for a license for trivial use
of the patent. Unisys never enforced the patent against
trivial users, and made statements that it is much less
concerned about people using the patent for decompression
(which is what giftopnm does than for compres- sion. The
patent expired in 2003.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that IBM also owns a patent covering
giftopnm.</p>

<p>A replacement for the GIF format that has never required
any patent license to use is the PNG format.</p>
