<p>FUSER(1) User Commands FUSER(1)</p>

<p>NAME fuser - identify processes using files or
sockets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fuser [-a|-s|-c] [-4|-6] [-n space ] [-k [-i]
[-signal ] ] [-muvf] name ... fuser -l fuser -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fuser displays the PIDs of processes using
the specified files or file systems. In the default display
mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the
type of access:</p>

<p>c current directory.</p>

<p>e executable being run.</p>

<p>f open file. f is omitted in default display mode.</p>

<p>F open file for writing. F is omitted in default display
mode.</p>

<p>r root directory.</p>

<p>m mmaped file or shared library.</p>

<p>fuser returns a non-zero return code if none of the
specified files is accessed or in case of a fatal error. If
at least one access has been found, fuser returns zero.</p>

<p>In order to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets,
the corre- sponding name space has to be selected with the
-n option. By default fuser will look in both IPv6 and IPv4
sockets. To change the default, behavior, use the -4 and -6
options. The socket(s) can be specified by the local and
remote port, and the remote address. All fields are
optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be
present:</p>

<p>[lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]</p>

<p>Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP
addresses and port numbers.</p>

<p>fuser outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else
is sent to stderr.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Show all files specified on the command line.
By default, only files that are accessed by at least one
process are shown.</p>

<p>-c Same as -m option, used for POSIX compatibility.</p>

<p>-f Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.</p>

<p>-k Kill processes accessing the file. Unless changed
with -signal, SIGKILL is sent. An fuser process never kills
itself, but may kill other fuser processes. The effective
user ID of the process executing fuser is set to its real
user ID before attempting to kill.</p>

<p>-i Ask the user for confirmation before killing a
process. This option is silently ignored if -k is not
present too.</p>

<p>-l List all known signal names.</p>

<p>-m name specifies a file on a mounted file system or a
block device that is mounted. All processes accessing files
on that file sys- tem are listed. If a directory file is
specified, it is auto- matically changed to name/. to use
any file system that might be mounted on that directory.</p>

<p>-n space Select a different name space. The name spaces
file (file names, the default), udp (local UDP ports), and
tcp (local TCP ports) are supported. For ports, either the
port number or the symbolic name can be specified. If there
is no ambiguity, the shortcut notation name/Ispace (e.g.
80/tcp ) can be used.</p>

<p>-s Silent operation. -u and -v are ignored in this mode.
-a must not be used with -s.</p>

<p>-signal Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when
killing pro- cesses. Signals can be specified either by name
(e.g. -HUP) or by number (e.g. -1). This option is silently
ignored if the -k option is not used.</p>

<p>-u Append the user name of the process owner to each
PID.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Processes are shown in a ps-like style.
The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are similar to ps. ACCESS
shows how the process accesses the file. If the access is by
the kernel (e.g. in the case of a mount point, a swap file,
etc.), kernel is shown instead of the PID.</p>

<p>-V Display version information.</p>

<p>-4 Search only for IPv4 sockets. This option must not be
used with the -6 option and only has an effect with the tcp
and udp names- paces.</p>

<p>-6 Search only for IPv6 sockets. This option must not be
used with the -4 option and only has an effect with the tcp
and udp names- paces.</p>

<p>- Reset all options and set the signal back to
SIGKILL.</p>

<p>FILES /proc location of the proc file system</p>

<p>EXAMPLES fuser -km /home kills all processes accessing
the file system /home in any way.</p>

<p>if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else something; fi
invokes something if no other process is using
/dev/ttyS1.</p>

<p>fuser telnet/tcp shows all processes at the (local)
TELNET port.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS Processes accessing the same file or file
system several times in the same way are only shown
once.</p>

<p>If the same object is specified several times on the
command line, some of those entries may be ignored.</p>

<p>fuser may only be able to gather partial information
unless run with privileges. As a consequence, files opened
by processes belonging to other users may not be listed and
executables may be classified as mapped only.</p>

<p>Installing fuser SUID root will avoid problems
associated with partial information, but may be undesirable
for security and privacy reasons.</p>

<p>udp and tcp name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets cant be
searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.</p>

<p>udp and tcp currently work with IPv6 and IPv4, but the
address fields can only be IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p>Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the -v
option.</p>

<p>The -k option only works on processes. If the user is
the kernel, fuser will print an advice, but take no action
beyond that.</p>

<p>BUGS fuser -m /dev/sgX will show (or kill with the -k
flag) all processes, even if you dont have that device
configured. There may be other devices it does this for
too.</p>

<p>fuser cannot report on any processes that it doesnt have
permission to look at the file descriptor table for. The
most common time this prob- lem occurs is when looking for
TCP or UDP sockets when running fuser as a non-root user. In
this case fuser will report no access</p>
