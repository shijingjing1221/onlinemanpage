<p>NAME concat - Join lists together</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS concat ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command joins each of its arguments
together with spaces after trimming leading and trailing
white-space from each of them. If all the arguments are
lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them into a
single list. It permits any number of arguments; if no args
are supplied, the result is an empty string.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Although concat will concatenate lists (so the
command: concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}} will return a b c d e
f {g h} as its result), it will also concate- nate things
that are not lists, and hence the command: concat &quot; a b
{c &quot; d &quot; e} f&quot; will return a b {c d e} f as
its result.</p>

<p>Note that the concatenation does not remove spaces from
the middle of its arguments, so the command: concat &quot;a
b c&quot; { d e f } will return a b c d e f (i.e. with three
spaces between the a, the b and the c).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO append(n), eval(n)</p>
