<p>sane-hp(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-hp(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-hp - SANE backend for HP ScanJet scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-hp library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to HP
ScanJet scanners which support SCL (Scanner Control Language
by HP). The following scanners are known positively to work
with this backend:</p>

<p>Model: Product id: Interface: ---------- -----------
---------- ScanJet Plus C9195A HP Parallel Interface Card
ScanJet IIc C1750A 3226 SCSI ScanJet IIcx C2500A 3332 SCSI
ScanJet IIp C1790A SCSI ScanJet 3C C2520A 3503 SCSI ScanJet
3P C2570A 3406 SCSI ScanJet 4C C2520A SCSI ScanJet 4P C1130A
3540 SCSI ScanJet 4100C C6290A USB ScanJet 5P C5110A SCSI
ScanJet 5100C C5190A parallel port ScanJet 5200C C7190A 3846
parallel port/USB ScanJet 6100C C2520A 3644 SCSI ScanJet
6200C C6270A 3828 SCSI/USB ScanJet 6250C C6270A 3828
SCSI/USB ScanJet 6300C C7670A SCSI/USB ScanJet 6350C C7670A
SCSI/USB ScanJet 6390C C7670A SCSI/USB PhotoSmart C5100A
R029,R030,R032 SCSI</p>

<p>Support for models 5100C/5200C connected to the parallel
port requires the ppSCSI driver available at
http://cyberelk.net/tim/par- port/ppscsi.html and
http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/.</p>

<p>Support for models 5200C/62X0C/63X0C connected to the
USB require the kernel scanner driver or libusb. See
sane-usb(5) for more details.</p>

<p>The &quot;hp&quot; backend no longer supports OfficeJet
multi-function peripher- als. For these devices use the
external &quot;hpoj&quot; backend in version 0.90 and later
of the &quot;HP OfficeJet Linux driver&quot;, available at
http://hpoj.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>Because Hewlett-Packard does no longer produce scanners
that support SCL (beside the OfficeJets), the above list of
supported scanners is complete. Other HP scanners are not
supported by the &quot;hp&quot; backend, but might be
supported by another one. See http://www.sane-project.org/.
You can also watch the sane-devel mailing list at
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.</p>

<p>More details about the hp backend can be found on its
homepage http://www.kirchgessner.net/sane.html.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special
device that corre- sponds to the scanner. For SCSI scanners
the special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
could be /dev/sga or /dev/sg2, for example. If the special
device name contains &quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot;
or &quot;ugen&quot;, it is assumed that the scanner is
connected by USB. For the HP ScanJet Plus the spe- cial
device name must be the device that corresponds to the
parallel interface card that was shipped with the scanner.
That is /dev/hpscan. A special driver is required for this
card. See ftp://rvs.ctrl-c.liu.se/pub/wingel/hpscan for
details. If the link does not work, try
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/scanners.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the hp.conf file is a list
of options and device names that correspond to HP ScanJet
scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
(#) are ignored. See sane-scsi(5) and sane-usb(5) on details
of what constitutes a valid device name.</p>

<p>Options specified in front of the first line that
contains a device name are defaults for all devices. Options
specified below a line that contains a device name apply
just to the most recently mentioned device.</p>

<p>Supported options are connect-scsi, connect-device,
enable-image-buffering, and dumb-read.</p>

<p>Option connect-scsi specifies that the scanner is
connected to the sys- tem by SCSI. Input/output is performed
using SCSI-commands. This is the default. But if your SCSI
device name contains &quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot;
or &quot;ugen&quot;, option connect-scsi must be specified.
Otherwise it is assumed that the scanner is connected by
USB.</p>

<p>Option connect-device specifies that the scanner is
connected to the system by a special device. Input/output is
performed by read()/write()-operations on the device. This
option must be used for HP ScanJet Plus or scanners
connected to USB which are accessed through a named device
(e.g. /dev/usb/scanner0). For device names that contain
&quot;usb&quot;, &quot;uscanner&quot; or &quot;ugen&quot;,
it is not necessary to specify option con- nect-device.</p>

<p>Option enable-image-buffering stores the scanned image
in memory before passing it to the frontend. Could be used
in case of forward/backward moving scanner lamp.</p>

<p>Option dumb-read can be used to work around problems
with &quot;Error during device I/O&quot;. These problems may
occur with certain SCSI-to-USB convert- ers or Buslogic SCSI
cards. The option should not be used for SCSI devices which
are working correctly. Otherwise startup of frontends and
changing parameters might be slower.</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>/dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/hpscan option
connect-device</p>

<p>/dev/scanner is typically a symlink to the actual SCSI
scanner device.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/hp.conf The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hp.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>$HOME/.sane/calib-hp:&lt;device&gt;.dat Calibration data
for HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner that is retrieved from the
scanner after calibration. The data is uploaded to the
scanner at start of the backend if it is in media mode print
media or if the media mode is changed to print media.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_HP If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>SANE_HOME_HP Only used for OS/2 and along with use of HP
PhotoSmart Photo- Scanner. Must be set to the directory
where the directory .sane is located. Is used to save and
read the calibration file.</p>

<p>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_SCSI</p>

<p>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_USB</p>

<p>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_DEVICE For each type of connection
(connect-scsi, connect-usb, con- nect-device) it can be
specified if the connection to the device should be kept
open (&quot;1&quot;) or not (&quot;0&quot;). Usually the
connections are closed after an operation is performed.
Keeping connection open to SCSI-devices can result in errors
during device IO when the scanner has not been used for some
time. By default, USB- connections are kept open. Other
connections are closed.</p>

<p>SANE_HP_RDREDO Specifies number of retries for read
operation before returning an EOF error. Only supported for
non-SCSI devices. Default: 1 retry. Time between retries is
0.1 seconds.</p>

<p>BUGS HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner In media mode slide and
negative , scan resolutions are rounded to multiple of 300
dpi. The scanner does not scale the data correctly on other
resolutions. Some newer models (firmware code R030 and
later) do not support adjustment of con- trast/intensity
level and tone map. The backend will simulate this by
software, but only for gray and 24 bit color.</p>

<p>Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) For use of the ADF with
xscanimage(1), first place paper in the ADF and then change
option scan source to ADF . Press change document to load a
sheet. Then press scan to start a scan. Maybe it is
sufficient to press scan without change document for
repeated scans. The use of the preview window is not
recommended when working with the ADF. Setting a window to
scan from ADF is not supported with xscanimage(1). Try
xsane(1).</p>

<p>Immediate actions Some actions in xscanimage(1) (i.e.
unload, select media, cali- brate) have an immediate effect
on the scanner without starting a scan. These options can
not be used with scanimage.</p>

<p>TODO HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner PhotoScanners with
firmware release R030 and up have no firmware support for
contrast/brightness/gamma table. In the current backend this
is simulated by software on 24 bits data. Simula- tion on 30
bits should give better results.</p>

<p>Data widths greater than 8 bits Custom gamma table does
not work.</p>

<p>Parallel scanner support Beside the ScanJet Plus which
came with its own parallel inter- face card, currently only
the HP ScanJet 5100C/5200C are sup- ported. These scanners
are using an internal parallel-to-SCSI converter which is
supported by the ppSCSI-driver (see above).</p>
