<p>NAME gpasswd - administer /etc/group and
/etc/gshadow</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpasswd [option] group</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gpasswd command is used to administer
/etc/group, and /etc/gshadow. Every group can have
administrators, members and a password.</p>

<p>System administrators can use the -A option to define
group administrator(s) and the -M option to define members.
They have all rights of group administrators and
members.</p>

<p>gpasswd called by a group administrator with a group
name only prompts for the new password of the group.</p>

<p>If a password is set the members can still use newgrp(1)
without a password, and non-members must supply the
password.</p>

<p>Notes about group passwords Group passwords are an
inherent security problem since more than one person is
permitted to know the password. However, groups are a useful
tool for permitting co-operation between different
users.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Except for the -A and -M options, the options
cannot be combined.</p>

<p>The options which apply to the gpasswd command are:</p>

<p>-a, --add user Add the user to the named group.</p>

<p>-d, --delete user Remove the user from the named
group.</p>

<p>-r, --remove-password Remove the password from the named
group. Only group members will be allowed to use newgrp to
join the named group.</p>

<p>-R, --restrict Restrict the access to the named group.
Only group members will be allowed to use newgrp to join the
named group.</p>

<p>-A, --administrators user,... Set the list of
administrative users.</p>

<p>-M, --members user,... Set the list of group
members.</p>

<p>CAVEATS This tool only operates on the /etc/group and
/etc/gshadow files. Thus you cannot change any NIS or LDAP
group. This must be performed on the corresponding
server.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>ENCRYPT_METHOD (string) This defines the system default
encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no
algorithm are specified on the command line).</p>

<p>It can take one of these values:</p>

<p>&middot; DES (default)</p>

<p>&middot; MD5</p>

<p>&middot; SHA256</p>

<p>&middot; SHA512</p>

<p>Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB
variable.</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean) Indicate if passwords must be
encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm. If set to yes, new
passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm
compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt
strings. Set to no if you need to copy encrypted passwords
to other systems which don&acute;t understand the new
algorithm. Default is no.</p>

<p>This variable is superceded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD
variable or by any command line option used to configure the
encryption algorithm.</p>

<p>This variable is deprecated. You should use
ENCRYPT_METHOD.</p>

<p>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
(number) When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512,
this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption
algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not
specified on the command line).</p>

<p>With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute
forcing the password. But note also that more CPU resources
will be needed to authenticate users.</p>

<p>If not specified, the libc will choose the default
number of rounds (5000).</p>

<p>The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.</p>

<p>If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value will be
used.</p>

<p>If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS &gt; SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the
highest value will be used.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO newgrp(1), groupadd(8), groupdel(8),
groupmod(8), grpck(8), group(5), gshadow(5).</p>
