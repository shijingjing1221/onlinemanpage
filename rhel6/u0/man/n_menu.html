<p>NAME menu, tk_menuSetFocus - Create and manipulate menu
widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS menu pathName ?options? tk_menuSetFocus
pathName</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -activebackground -borderwidth
-foreground -activeborderwidth -cursor -relief
-activeforeground -disabledforeground -takefocus -background
-font</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-postcommand
Database Name: postCommand Database Class: Command</p>

<p>If this option is specified then it provides a Tcl
command to execute each time the menu is posted. The command
is invoked by the post widget command before posting the
menu. Note that in Tk 8.0 on Macintosh and Windows, all
post-commands in a system of menus are executed before any
of those menus are posted. This is due to the limitations in
the individual platforms menu man- agers.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectcolor Database Name:
selectColor Database Class: Background</p>

<p>For menu entries that are check buttons or radio
buttons, this option specifies the color to display in the
indicator when the check button or radio button is
selected.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-tearoff Database Name: tearOff
Database Class: TearOff</p>

<p>This option must have a proper boolean value, which
specifies whether or not the menu should include a tear-off
entry at the top. If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the
menu and the other entries will number starting at 1. The
default menu bindings arrange for the menu to be torn off
when the tear-off entry is invoked.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-tearoffcommand Database Name:
tearOffCommand Database Class: TearOffCommand</p>

<p>If this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies
a Tcl command to invoke whenever the menu is torn off. The
actual command will consist of the value of this option,
followed by a space, followed by the name of the menu
window, followed by a space, followed by the name of the
name of the torn off menu window. For example, if the
options value is a b and menu .x.y is torn off to create a
new menu .x.tearoff1, then the com- mand a b .x.y
.x.tearoff1 will be invoked.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-title Database Name: title Database
Class: Title</p>

<p>The string will be used to title the window created when
this menu is torn off. If the title is NULL, then the window
will have the title of the menubutton or the text of the
cascade item from which this menu was invoked.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-type Database Name: type Database
Class: Type</p>

<p>This option can be one of menubar, tearoff, or normal,
and is set when the menu is created. While the string
returned by the configuration database will change if this
option is changed, this does not affect the menu widgets
behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is not
normally set outside of the Tk library.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION The menu command creates a new top-level
window (given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
menu widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the menu such as its colors and font.
The menu command returns its pathName argument. At the time
this com- mand is invoked, there must not exist a window
named pathName, but pathNames parent must exist.</p>

<p>A menu is a widget that displays a collection of
one-line entries arranged in one or more columns. There
exist several different types of entries, each with
different properties. Entries of different types may be
combined in a single menu. Menu entries are not the same as
entry widgets. In fact, menu entries are not even distinct
widgets; the entire menu is one widget.</p>

<p>Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate
fields. The main field is a label in the form of a text
string, a bitmap, or an image, controlled by the -label,
-bitmap, and -image options for the entry. If the
-accelerator option is specified for an entry then a second
textual field is displayed to the right of the label. The
accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that
may be typed in the application to cause the same result as
invoking the menu entry. The third field is an indicator.
The indicator is present only for check- button or
radiobutton entries. It indicates whether the entry is
selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry s
string.</p>

<p>In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself
differently) whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry.
If a mouse button is released over the entry then the entry
is invoked. The effect of invo- cation is different for each
type of entry; these effects are described below in the
sections on individual entries.</p>

<p>Entries may be disabled, which causes their labels and
accelerators to be displayed with dimmer colors. The default
menu bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be
activated or invoked. Disabled entries may be re-enabled, at
which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke them
again.</p>

<p>Whenever a menu s active entry is changed, a
&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is send to the
menu. The active item can then be queried from the menu, and
an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive
help text for the entry.</p>

<p>TYPES OF ENTRIES COMMAND ENTRIES The most common kind of
menu entry is a command entry, which behaves much like a
button widget. When a command entry is invoked, a Tcl
command is executed. The Tcl command is specified with the
-command option.</p>

<p>SEPARATOR ENTRIES A separator is an entry that is
displayed as a horizontal dividing line. A separator may not
be activated or invoked, and it has no behavior other than
its display appearance.</p>

<p>CHECKBUTTON ENTRIES A checkbutton menu entry behaves
much like a checkbutton widget. When it is invoked it
toggles back and forth between the selected and dese- lected
states. When the entry is selected, a particular value is
stored in a particular global variable (as determined by the
-onvalue and -variable options for the entry); when the
entry is deselected another value (determined by the
-offvalue option) is stored in the global variable. An
indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a
checkbutton entry. If the entry is selected then the indi-
cators center is displayed in the color given by the
-selectcolor option for the entry; otherwise the indicators
center is displayed in the background color for the menu. If
a -command option is specified for a checkbutton entry, then
its value is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry
is invoked; this happens after toggling the entrys selected
state.</p>

<p>RADIOBUTTON ENTRIES A radiobutton menu entry behaves
much like a radiobutton widget. Radiobutton entries are
organized in groups of which only one entry may be selected
at a time. Whenever a particular entry becomes selected it
stores a particular value into a particular global variable
(as deter- mined by the -value and -variable options for the
entry). This action causes any previously-selected entry in
the same group to deselect itself. Once an entry has become
selected, any change to the entrys associated variable will
cause the entry to deselect itself. Grouping of radiobutton
entries is determined by their associated variables: if two
entries have the same associated variable then they are in
the same group. An indicator diamond is displayed to the
left of the label in each radiobutton entry. If the entry is
selected then the indicators center is displayed in the
color given by the -selectcolor option for the entry;
otherwise the indicators center is displayed in the back-
ground color for the menu. If a -command option is specified
for a radiobutton entry, then its value is evaluated as a
Tcl command each time the entry is invoked; this happens
after selecting the entry.</p>

<p>CASCADE ENTRIES A cascade entry is one with an
associated menu (determined by the -menu option). Cascade
entries allow the construction of cascading menus. The
postcascade widget command can be used to post and unpost
the asso- ciated menu just next to of the cascade entry. The
associated menu must be a child of the menu containing the
cascade entry (this is needed in order for menu traversal to
work correctly).</p>

<p>A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking a
Tcl command of the form menu post x y where menu is the path
name of the associated menu, and x and y are the root-window
coordinates of the upper-right corner of the cascade entry.
On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by executing a Tcl
command with the form menu unpost where menu is the name of
the associated menu. On other platforms, the platforms
native code takes care of unposting the menu.</p>

<p>If a -command option is specified for a cascade entry
then it is evalu- ated as a Tcl command whenever the entry
is invoked. This is not sup- ported on Windows.</p>

<p>TEAR-OFF ENTRIES A tear-off entry appears at the top of
the menu if enabled with the tearOff option. It is not like
other menu entries in that it cannot be created with the add
widget command and cannot be deleted with the delete widget
command. When a tear-off entry is created it appears as a
dashed line at the top of the menu. Under the default
bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy
to be made of the menu and all of its submenus.</p>

<p>MENUBARS Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel
window (see toplevel command for syntax). On the Macintosh,
whenever the toplevel is in front, this menus cascade items
will appear in the menubar across the top of the main
monitor. On Windows and Unix, this menus items will be
displayed in a menubar across the top of the window. These
menus will behave according to the interface guidelines of
their platforms. For every menu set as a menubar, a clone
menu is made. See the CLONES sec- tion for more
information.</p>

<p>As noted, menubars may behave differently on different
platforms. One example of this concerns the handling of
checkbuttons and radiobuttons within the menu. While it is
permitted to put these menu elements on menubars, they may
not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due to
system restrictions.</p>

<p>SPECIAL MENUS IN MENUBARS Certain menus in a menubar
will be treated specially. On the Macin- tosh, access to the
special Application and Help menus is provided. On Windows,
access to the Windows System menu in each window is
provided. On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu
is provided. In all cases, these menus must be created with
the command name of the menubar menu concatenated with the
special name. So for a menubar named .menubar, on the
Macintosh, the special menus would be .menubar.apple and
.menubar.help; on Windows, the special menu would be
.menubar.sys- tem; on X Windows, the help menu would be
.menubar.help.</p>

<p>When Tk sees a .menubar.apple menu on the Macintosh,
that menus con- tents make up the first items of the
Application menu whenever the win- dow containing the
menubar is in front. After all of the Tk-defined items, the
menu will have a separator, followed by all standard Appli-
cation menu items.</p>

<p>When Tk sees a Help menu on the Macintosh, the menus
contents are appended to the standard Help menu on the right
of the users menubar whenever the windows menubar is in
front. The first items in the menu are provided by Mac OS
X.</p>

<p>When Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are
appended to the system menu that the menubar is attached to.
This menu has an icon rep- resenting a spacebar, and can be
invoked with the mouse or by typing Alt+Spacebar. Due to
limitations in the Windows API, any font changes, colors,
images, bitmaps, or tearoff images will not appear in the
sys- tem menu.</p>

<p>When Tk see a Help menu on X Windows, the menu is moved
to be last in the menubar and is right justified.</p>

<p>CLONES When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel
window, or when a menu is torn off, a clone of the menu is
made. This clone is a menu widget in its own right, but it
is a child of the original. Changes in the configuration of
the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally, any
cascades that are pointed to are also cloned so that menu
traversal will work right. Clones are destroyed when either
the tearoff or menubar goes away, or when the original menu
is destroyed.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The menu command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the
command.</p>

<p>Many of the widget commands for a menu take as one
argument an indica- tor of which entry of the menu to
operate on. These indicators are called indexes and may be
specified in any of the following forms:</p>

<p>number Specifies the entry numerically, where 0
corresponds to the top-most entry of the menu, 1 to the
entry below it, and so on.</p>

<p>active Indicates the entry that is currently active. If
no entry is active then this form is equivalent to none.
This form may not be abbreviated.</p>

<p>end Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu. If there
are no entries in the menu then this form is equivalent to
none. This form may not be abbreviated.</p>

<p>last Same as end.</p>

<p>none Indicates no entry at all; this is used most
commonly with the activate option to deactivate all the
entries in the menu. In most cases the specification of none
causes nothing to happen in the widget command. This form
may not be abbreviated.</p>

<p>@number In this form, number is treated as a
y-coordinate in the menus window; the entry closest to that
y-coordinate is used. For example, @0 indicates the top-most
entry in the window.</p>

<p>pattern If the index does not satisfy one of the above
forms then this form is used. Pattern is pattern-matched
against the label of each entry in the menu, in order from
the top down, until a matching entry is found. The rules of
Tcl_StringMatch are used.</p>

<p>The following widget commands are possible for menu
widgets:</p>

<p>pathName activate index Change the state of the entry
indicated by index to active and redisplay it using its
active colors. Any previously-active entry is deactivated.
If index is specified as none, or if the specified entry is
disabled, then the menu ends up with no active entry.
Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName add type ?option value option value ...? Add a
new entry to the bottom of the menu. The new entrys type is
given by type and must be one of cascade, checkbutton, com-
mand, radiobutton, or separator, or a unique abbreviation of
one of the above. If additional arguments are present, they
specify any of the following options:</p>

<p>-activebackground value Specifies a background color to
use for displaying this entry when it is active. If this
option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
the activeBackground option for the overall menu is used. If
the tk_strictMo- tif variable has been set to request strict
Motif compli- ance, then this option is ignored and the
-background option is used in its place. This option is not
avail- able for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-activeforeground value Specifies a foreground color to
use for displaying this entry when it is active. If this
option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
the activeForeground option for the overall menu is used.
This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>

<p>-accelerator value Specifies a string to display at the
right side of the menu entry. Normally describes an
accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed to invoke
the same function as the menu entry. This option is not
available for separa- tor or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-background value Specifies a background color to use
for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
(neither active nor disabled). If this option is specified
as an empty string (the default), then the background option
for the overall menu is used. This option is not available
for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-bitmap value Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu
instead of a textual label, in any of the forms accepted by
Tk_Get- Bitmap. This option overrides the -label option (as
con- trolled by the -compound option) but may be reset to an
empty string to enable a textual label to be displayed. If a
-image option has been specified, it overrides -bitmap. This
option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>

<p>-columnbreak value When this option is zero, the entry
appears below the previous entry. When this option is one,
the entry appears at the top of a new column in the
menu.</p>

<p>-command value Specifies a Tcl command to execute when
the menu entry is invoked. Not available for separator or
tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-compound value Specifies whether the menu entry should
display both an image and text, and if so, where the image
should be placed relative to the text. Valid values for this
option are bottom, center, left, none, right and top. The
default value is none, meaning that the button will display
either an image or text, depending on the values of the
-image and -bitmap options.</p>

<p>-font value Specifies the font to use when drawing the
label or accelerator string in this entry. If this option is
specified as an empty string (the default) then the font
option for the overall menu is used. This option is not
available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-foreground value Specifies a foreground color to use
for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
(neither active nor disabled). If this option is specified
as an empty string (the default), then the foreground option
for the overall menu is used. This option is not available
for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-hidemargin value Specifies whether the standard margins
should be drawn for this menu entry. This is useful when
creating palette with images in them, i.e., color palettes,
pattern palettes, etc. 1 indicates that the margin for the
entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.</p>

<p>-image value Specifies an image to display in the menu
instead of a text string or bitmap. The image must have been
created by some previous invocation of image create. This
option overrides the -label and -bitmap options (as
controlled by the -compound option) but may be reset to an
empty string to enable a textual or bitmap label to be dis-
played. This option is not available for separator or
tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-indicatoron value Available only for checkbutton and
radiobutton entries. Value is a boolean that determines
whether or not the indicator should be displayed.</p>

<p>-label value Specifies a string to display as an
identifying label in the menu entry. Not available for
separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-menu value Available only for cascade entries.
Specifies the path name of the submenu associated with this
entry. The sub- menu must be a child of the menu.</p>

<p>-offvalue value Available only for checkbutton entries.
Specifies the value to store in the entrys associated
variable when the entry is deselected.</p>

<p>-onvalue value Available only for checkbutton entries.
Specifies the value to store in the entrys associated
variable when the entry is selected.</p>

<p>-selectcolor value Available only for checkbutton and
radiobutton entries. Specifies the color to display in the
indicator when the entry is selected. If the value is an
empty string (the default) then the selectColor option for
the menu deter- mines the indicator color.</p>

<p>-selectimage value Available only for checkbutton and
radiobutton entries. Specifies an image to display in the
entry (in place of the -image option) when it is selected.
Value is the name of an image, which must have been created
by some previous invocation of image create. This option is
ignored unless the -image option has been specified.</p>

<p>-state value Specifies one of three states for the
entry: normal, active, or disabled. In normal state the
entry is dis- played using the foreground option for the
menu and the background option from the entry or the menu.
The active state is typically used when the pointer is over
the entry. In active state the entry is displayed using the
activeForeground option for the menu along with the
activebackground option from the entry. Disabled state means
that the entry should be insensitive: the default bindings
will refuse to activate or invoke the entry. In this state
the entry is displayed according to the dis- abledForeground
option for the menu and the background option from the
entry. This option is not available for separator
entries.</p>

<p>-underline value Specifies the integer index of a
character to underline in the entry. This option is also
queried by the default bindings and used to implement
keyboard traversal. 0 corresponds to the first character of
the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character,
and so on. If a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry
then this option is ignored. This option is not available
for sep- arator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p>-value value Available only for radiobutton entries.
Specifies the value to store in the entrys associated
variable when the entry is selected. If an empty string is
specified, then the -label option for the entry as the value
to store in the variable.</p>

<p>-variable value Available only for checkbutton and
radiobutton entries. Specifies the name of a global value to
set when the entry is selected. For checkbutton entries the
variable is also set when the entry is deselected. For
radiobut- ton entries, changing the variable causes the
currently- selected entry to deselect itself.</p>

<p>The add widget command returns an empty string.</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the menu command.</p>

<p>pathName clone newPathname ?cloneType? Makes a clone of
the current menu named newPathName. This clone is a menu in
its own right, but any changes to the clone are propagated
to the original menu and vice versa. cloneType can be
normal, menubar, or tearoff. Should not normally be called
out- side of the Tk library. See the CLONES section for more
informa- tion.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the menu command.</p>

<p>pathName delete index1 ?index2? Delete all of the menu
entries between index1 and index2 inclu- sive. If index2 is
omitted then it defaults to index1. Attempts to delete a
tear-off menu entry are ignored (instead, you should change
the tearOff option to remove the tear-off entry).</p>

<p>pathName entrycget index option Returns the current
value of a configuration option for the entry given by
index. Option may have any of the values accepted by the add
widget command.</p>

<p>pathName entryconfigure index ?options? This command is
similar to the configure command, except that it applies to
the options for an individual entry, whereas config- ure
applies to the options for the menu as a whole. Options may
have any of the values accepted by the add widget command.
If options are specified, options are modified as indicated
in the command and the command returns an empty string. If
no options are specified, returns a list describing the
current options for entry index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list).</p>

<p>pathName index index Returns the numerical index
corresponding to index, or none if index was specified as
none.</p>

<p>pathName insert index type ?option value option value
...? Same as the add widget command except that it inserts
the new entry just before the entry given by index, instead
of appending to the end of the menu. The type, option, and
value arguments have the same interpretation as for the add
widget command. It is not possible to insert new menu
entries before the tear-off entry, if the menu has one.</p>

<p>pathName invoke index Invoke the action of the menu
entry. See the sections on the individual entries above for
details on what happens. If the menu entry is disabled then
nothing happens. If the entry has a command associated with
it then the result of that command is returned as the result
of the invoke widget command. Otherwise the result is an
empty string. Note: invoking a menu entry does not
automatically unpost the menu; the default bindings normally
take care of this before invoking the invoke widget
command.</p>

<p>pathName post x y Arrange for the menu to be displayed
on the screen at the root- window coordinates given by x and
y. These coordinates are adjusted if necessary to guarantee
that the entire menu is visi- ble on the screen. This
command normally returns an empty string. If the postCommand
option has been specified, then its value is executed as a
Tcl script before posting the menu and the result of that
script is returned as the result of the post widget command.
If an error returns while executing the com- mand, then the
error is returned without posting the menu.</p>

<p>pathName postcascade index Posts the submenu associated
with the cascade entry given by index, and unposts any
previously posted submenu. If index does not correspond to a
cascade entry, or if pathName is not posted, the command has
no effect except to unpost any currently posted submenu.</p>

<p>pathName type index Returns the type of the menu entry
given by index. This is the type argument passed to the add
widget command when the entry was created, such as command
or separator, or tearoff for a tear-off entry.</p>

<p>pathName unpost Unmap the window so that it is no longer
displayed. If a lower- level cascaded menu is posted, unpost
that menu. Returns an empty string. This subcommand does not
work on Windows and the Macintosh, as those platforms have
their own way of unposting menus.</p>

<p>pathName xposition index Returns a decimal string giving
the x-coordinate within the menu window of the leftmost
pixel in the entry specified by index.</p>

<p>pathName yposition index Returns a decimal string giving
the y-coordinate within the menu window of the topmost pixel
in the entry specified by index.</p>

<p>MENU CONFIGURATIONS The default bindings support four
different ways of using menus:</p>

<p>Pulldown Menus in Menubar This is the most common case.
You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar. You
then add cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull
down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You then create
all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the
menu using the -menu option of the toplevels widget command.
See the toplevel manual entry for details.</p>

<p>Pulldown Menus in Menu Buttons This is the compatible
way to do menu bars. You create one menubutton widget for
each top-level menu, and typically you arrange a series of
menubuttons in a row in a menubar window. You also create
the top-level menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them
together with -menu options in menubuttons and cas- cade
menu entries. The top-level menu must be a child of the
menubutton, and each submenu must be a child of the menu
that refers to it. Once you have done this, the default
bindings will allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of
menus via its menubutton; see the menubutton manual entry
for details.</p>

<p>Popup Menus Popup menus typically post in response to a
mouse button press or keystroke. You create the popup menus
and any cascaded sub- menus, then you call the tk_popup
procedure at the appropriate time to post the top-level
menu.</p>

<p>Option Menus An option menu consists of a menubutton
with an associated menu that allows you to select one of
several values. The current value is displayed in the
menubutton and is also stored in a global variable. Use the
tk_optionMenu procedure to create option menubuttons and
their menus.</p>

<p>Torn-off Menus You create a torn-off menu by invoking
the tear-off entry at the top of an existing menu. The
default bindings will create a new menu that is a copy of
the original menu and leave it perma- nently posted as a
top-level window. The torn-off menu behaves just the same as
the original menu.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings
for menus that give them the following default behavior:</p>

<p>[1] When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath
the mouse cursor activates; as the mouse moves around the
menu, the active entry changes to track the mouse.</p>

<p>[2] When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in
the menu deactivate, except in the special case where the
mouse moves from a menu to a cascaded submenu.</p>

<p>[3] When a button is released over a menu, the active
entry (if any) is invoked. The menu also unposts unless it
is a torn-off menu.</p>

<p>[4] The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry
and unpost the menu.</p>

<p>[5] If any of the entries in a menu have letters
underlined with the -underline option, then pressing one of
the underlined letters (or its upper-case or lower-case
equivalent) invokes that entry and unposts the menu.</p>

<p>[6] The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress
without invoking any entry. It also unposts the menu unless
it is a torn-off menu.</p>

<p>[7] The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or
lower entry in the menu. When one end of the menu is
reached, the active entry wraps around to the other end.</p>

<p>[8] The Left key moves to the next menu to the left. If
the current menu is a cascaded submenu, then the submenu is
unposted and the current menu entry becomes the cascade
entry in the parent. If the current menu is a top-level menu
posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is
unposted and the next menubutton to the left is posted.
Otherwise the key has no effect. The left-right order of
menubuttons is determined by their stacking order: Tk
assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by default is the
first one created) is on the left.</p>

<p>[9] The Right key moves to the next menu to the right.
If the cur- rent entry is a cascade entry, then the submenu
is posted and the current menu entry becomes the first entry
in the submenu. Otherwise, if the current menu was posted
from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is unposted
and the next menubutton to the right is posted.</p>

<p>Disabled menu entries are non-responsive: they do not
activate and they ignore mouse button presses and
releases.</p>

<p>Several of the bindings make use of the command
tk_menuSetFocus. It saves the current focus and sets the
focus to its pathName argument, which is a menu widget.</p>

<p>The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new
bindings for indi- vidual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.</p>

<p>BUGS At present it is not possible to use the option
database to specify values for the options to individual
entries.</p>
