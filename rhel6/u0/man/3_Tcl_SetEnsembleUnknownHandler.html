<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out) The interpreter in
which the ensemble is to be created or found. Also where
error result mes- sages are written. The functions whose
names start with Tcl_GetEnsem- ble may have a NULL for the
interp, but all other functions must not.</p>

<p>const char *name (in) The name of the ensemble command
to be created.</p>

<p>Tcl_Namespace *namespacePtr (in) The namespace to which
the ensemble command is to be bound, or NULL for the current
namespace.</p>

<p>int ensFlags (in) An ORed set of flag bits describing
the basic con- figuration of the ensem- ble. Currently only
one bit has meaning, TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX, which is present
when the ensemble command should also match unambiguous
prefixes of subcommands.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *cmdNameObj (in) A value holding the name of the
ensemble command to look up.</p>

<p>int flags (in) An ORed set of flag bits controlling the
behavior of Tcl_FindEnsemble. Cur- rently only
TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG is sup- ported.</p>

<p>Tcl_Command token (in) A normal command token that
refers to an ensem- ble command, or which you wish to use
for testing as an ensemble command in Tcl_IsEnsemble.</p>

<p>int *ensFlagsPtr (out) Pointer to a variable into which
to write the current ensemble flag bits; currently only the
bit TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX is defined.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *dictObj (in) A dictionary value to use for the
subcommand to implementation command prefix mapping
dictionary in the ensemble. May be NULL if the mapping dic-
tionary is to be removed.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj **dictObjPtr (out) Pointer to a variable into
which to write the current ensemble mapping dictionary.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *listObj (in) A list value to use for the
defined list of sub- commands in the dictio- nary or the
unknown sub- commmand handler command prefix. May be NULL if
the subcommand list or unknown handler are to be
removed.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj **listObjPtr (out) Pointer to a variable into
which to write the current defiend list of subcommands or
the cur- rent unknown handler pre- fix.</p>

<p>Tcl_Namespace **namespacePtrPtr (out) Pointer to a
variable into which to write the handle of the namespace to
which the ensemble is bound.

<p>DESCRIPTION An ensemble is a command, bound to some
namespace, which consists of a collection of subcommands
implemented by other Tcl commands. The first argument to the
ensemble command is always interpreted as a selector that
states what subcommand to execute.</p>

<p>Ensembles are created using Tcl_CreateEnsemble, which
takes four argu- ments: the interpreter to work within, the
name of the ensemble to cre- ate, the namespace within the
interpreter to bind the ensemble to, and the default set of
ensemble flags. The result of the function is the command
token for the ensemble, which may be used to further
configure the ensemble using the API descibed below in
ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES.</p>

<p>Given the name of an ensemble command, the token for
that command may be retrieved using Tcl_FindEnsemble. If the
given command name (in cmd- NameObj) does not refer to an
ensemble command, the result of the func- tion is NULL and
(if the TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG bit is set in flags) an error
message is left in the interpreter result.</p>

<p>A command token may be checked to see if it refers to an
ensemble using Tcl_IsEnsemble. This returns 1 if the token
refers to an ensemble, or 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES Every ensemble has four read-write
properties and a read-only property. The properties are:</p>

<p>flags (read-write) The set of flags for the ensemble,
expressed as a bit-field. Currently, the only public flag is
TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX which is set when unambiguous prefixes
of subcommands are permitted to be resolved to
implementations as well as exact matches. The flags may be
read and written using Tcl_GetEnsembleFlags and
Tcl_SetEnsembleFlags respectively. The result of both of
those functions is a Tcl result code (TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR
if the token does not refer to an ensemble).</p>

<p>mapping dictionary (read-write) A dictionary containing
a mapping from subcommand names to lists of words to use as
a command prefix (replacing the first two words of the
command which are the ensemble command itself and the
subcommand name), or NULL if every subcommand is to be
mapped to the command with the same unqualified name in the
ensembles bound namespace. Defaults to NULL. May be read and
written using Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict and
Tcl_SetEnsembleMap- pingDict respectively. The result of
both of those functions is a Tcl result code (TCL_OK, or
TCL_ERROR if the token does not refer to an ensemble) and
the dictionary obtained from Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict
should always be treated as immutable even if it is
unshared.</p>

<p>subcommand list (read-write) A list of all the
subcommand names for the ensemble, or NULL if this is to be
derived from either the keys of the mapping dictionary (see
above) or (if that is also NULL) from the set of commands
exported by the bound namespace. May be read and writ- ten
using Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList and Tcl_SetEnsembleSub-
commandList respectively. The result of both of those
functions is a Tcl result code (TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if the
token does not refer to an ensemble) and the list obtained
from Tcl_GetEnsem- bleSubcommandList should alays be treated
as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>

<p>unknown subcommand handler command prefix (read-write) A
list of words to prepend on the front of any subcommand when
the subcommand is unknown to the ensemble (according to the
cur- rent prefix handling rule); see the namespace ensemble
command for more details. If NULL, the default behavior -
generate a suitable error message - will be used when an
unknown subcommand is encountered. May be read and written
using Tcl_GetEnsembleUn- knownHandler and
Tcl_SetEnsembleUnknownHandler respectively. The result of
both functions is a Tcl result code (TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if
the token does not refer to an ensemble) and the list
obtained from Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler should always be
treated as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>

<p>bound namespace (read-only) The namespace to which the
ensemble is bound; when the namespace is deleted, so too
will the ensemble, and this namespace is also the namespace
whose list of exported commands is used if both the mapping
dictionary and the subcommand list properties are NULL. May
be read using Tcl_GetEnsembleNamespace which returns a Tcl
result code (TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR if the token does not
refer to an ensemble).</p>
