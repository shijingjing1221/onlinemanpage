<p>DAT.CONF(5) DAT.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME dat.conf - configuration file for static
registration of user-level DAT rdma providers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The DAT (direct access transport)
architecture supports the use of mul- tiple DAT providers
within a single consumer application. Consumers implicitly
select a provider using the Interface Adapter name parameter
passed to dat_ia_open().</p>

<p>The subsystem that maps Interface Adapter names to
provider implementa- tions is known as the DAT registry.
When a consumer calls dat_ia_open(), the appropriate
provider is found and notified of the consumer s request to
access the IA. After this point, all DAT API calls acting on
DAT objects are automatically directed to the appropri- ate
provider entry points.</p>

<p>A persistent, administratively configurable database is
used to store mappings from IA names to provider
information. This provider informa- tion includes: the file
system path to the provider library object, version
information, and thread safety information. The location and
format of the registry is platform dependent. This database
is known as the Static Registry (SR) and is provided via
entries in the dat.conf file. The process of adding a
provider entry is termed Static Registra- tion.</p>

<p>Registry File Format</p>

<p>* All characters after # on a line are ignored
(comments). * Lines on which there are no characters other
than whitespace and comments are considered blank lines and
are ignored. * Non-blank lines must have seven whitespace
separated fields. These fields may contain whitespace if the
field is quoted with double quotes. Within fields quoated
with double quotes, the backslash or qoute are valid escape
sequences: * Each non-blank line will contain the following
fields: - The IA Name. - The API version of the library:
[k|u]major.minor where &quot;major&quot; and
&quot;minor&quot; are both integers in decimal format.
User-level examples: &quot;u1.2&quot;, and &quot;u2.0&quot;.
- Whether the library is thread-safe: [threadsafe|nonthread-
safe] - Whether this is the default section:
[default|nondefault] - The library image, version included,
to be loaded. - The vendor id and version of DAPL provider:
id.major.minor - ia params, IA specific parameters - device
name and port - platform params, (not used)</p>

<p>Example netdev entries for OpenFabrics rdma_cm
providers, both v1.2 and v2.0</p>

<p>OpenIB-cma u1.2 nonthreadsafe default libdaplcma.so.1
dapl.1.2 &quot;ib0 0&quot; &quot;&quot; ofa-v2-ib0 u2.0
nonthreadsafe default libdaplofa.so.2 dapl.2.0 &quot;ib0
0&quot; &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>NOTE: The OpenFabrics providers use &lt;ia_params&gt; to
specify the device with one of the following: network
address, network hostname, or netdev name; along with port
number.</p>

<p>The OpenIB- and ofa-v2- IA names are unique mappings.
Reserved for OpenFabrics providers.</p>

<p>The default location for this configuration file is
/etc/dat.conf. The file location may be overridden with the
environment variable DAT_OVER-
RIDE=/your_own_directory/your_dat.conf.</p>
