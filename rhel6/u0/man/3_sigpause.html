<p>SIGPAUSE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SIGPAUSE(3)</p>

<p>NAME sigpause - atomically release blocked signals and
wait for interrupt</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigpause(int sigmask); /* BSD */</p>

<p>int sigpause(int sig); /* System V / Unix95 */</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dont use this function. Use sigsuspend(2)
instead.</p>

<p>The function sigpause() is designed to wait for some
signal. It changes the process s signal mask (set of blocked
signals), and then waits for a signal to arrive. Upon
arrival of a signal, the original signal mask is
restored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If sigpause() returns, it was interrupted
by a signal and the return value is -1 with errno set to
EINTR.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The System V version of sigpause() is
standardized in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES History The classical BSD version of this function
appeared in 4.2BSD. It sets the processs signal mask to
sigmask. Unix95 standardized the incom- patible System V
version of this function, which removes only the spec- ified
signal sig from the process s signal mask. The unfortunate
situ- ation with two incompatible functions with the same
name was solved by the sigsuspend(2) function, that takes a
sigset_t * argument (instead of an int).</p>

<p>Linux Notes On Linux, this routine is a system call only
on the Sparc (sparc64) architecture.</p>

<p>Libc4 and libc5 only know about the BSD version.</p>

<p>Glibc uses the BSD version if the _BSD_SOURCE feature
test macro is defined and none of _POSIX_SOURCE,
_POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE, or _SVID_SOURCE
is defined. The System V version is used if _XOPEN_SOURCE is
defined.</p>
