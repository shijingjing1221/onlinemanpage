<p>NAME lpstat - print cups status information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lpstat [ -E ] [ -H ] [ -U username ] [ -h
hostname[:port] ] [ -l ] [ -W which-jobs ] [ -a [
destination(s) ] ] [ -c [ class(es) ] ] [ -d ] [ -o [
destination(s) ] ] [ -p [ printer(s) ] ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -s
] [ -t ] [ -u [ user(s) ] ] [ -v [ printer(s) ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lpstat displays status information about the
current classes, jobs, and printers. When run with no
arguments, lpstat will list jobs queued by the current
user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The lpstat command supports the following
options:</p>

<p>-E Forces encryption when connecting to the server.</p>

<p>-H Shows the server hostname and port.</p>

<p>-R Shows the ranking of print jobs.</p>

<p>-U username Specifies an alternate username.</p>

<p>-W which-jobs Specifies which jobs to show, completed or
not-completed (the default). This option must appear before
the -o option and/or any printer names, otherwise the
default (not-completed) value will be used in the request to
the scheduler.</p>

<p>-a [printer(s)] Shows the accepting state of printer
queues. If no printers are specified then all printers are
listed.</p>

<p>-c [class(es)] Shows the printer classes and the
printers that belong to them. If no classes are specified
then all classes are listed.</p>

<p>-d Shows the current default destination.</p>

<p>-h server[:port] Specifies an alternate server.</p>

<p>-l Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or
jobs.</p>

<p>-o [destination(s)] Shows the jobs queue on the
specified destinations. If no destina- tions are specified
all jobs are shown.</p>

<p>-p [printer(s)] Shows the printers and whether or not
they are enabled for print- ing. If no printers are
specified then all printers are listed.</p>

<p>-r Shows whether the CUPS server is running.</p>

<p>-s Shows a status summary, including the default
destination, a list of classes and their member printers,
and a list of printers and their associated devices. This is
equivalent to using the &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, and
&quot;-v&quot; options.</p>

<p>-t Shows all status information. This is equivalent to
using the &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;,
&quot;-v&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-p&quot;, and
&quot;-o&quot; options.</p>

<p>-u [user(s)] Shows a list of print jobs queued by the
specified users. If no users are specified, lists the jobs
queued by the current user.</p>

<p>-v [printer(s)] Shows the printers and what device they
are attached to. If no printers are specified then all
printers are listed.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS
allows printer names to con- tain any printable character
except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, and &quot;#&quot;. Also,
printer and class names are not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The &quot;-h&quot;, &quot;-E&quot;, &quot;-U&quot;, and
&quot;-W&quot; options are unique to CUPS.</p>

<p>The Solaris &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-P&quot;, and
&quot;-S&quot; options are silently ignored.</p>
