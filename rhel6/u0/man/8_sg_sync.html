<p>NAME sg_sync - send the scsi command synchronize
cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_sync [--count=COUNT] [--group=GROUP]
[--help] [--immed] [--lba=LBA] [--sync-nv] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send SYNCHRONIZE CACHE (10) command to
DEVICE. This command is defined for SCSI block devices (see
SBC-2). If successful this command makes sure that any
blocks whose latest versions are held in (volatile) cache
are written to (also termed as &quot;synchronized
with&quot;) the medium. If the --sync-nv option is given and
the device has a non-volatile cache then any blocks whose
latest versions are held in volatile cache are written to
non-volatile cache.</p>

<p>If the LBA and COUNT arguments are both zero (their
defaults) then all blocks in the cache are synchronized. If
LBA is greater than zero while COUNT is zero then blocks in
the cache whose addresses are from and including LBA to the
highest lba on the device are synchronized. If both LBA and
COUNT are non zero then blocks in the cache whose addresses
lie in the range LBA to LBA+COUNT-1 inclusive are synchro-
nized with the medium.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --count=COUNT where COUNT is the number of blocks to
synchronize from and including LBA. Default value is 0. When
0 then all blocks in the (volatile) cache from and including
LBA argument to the highest block address are
synchronized.</p>

<p>-g, --group=GROUP where GROUP is the group number which
can be between 0 and 31 inclusive. The default value is 0 .
Group numbers are used to segregate data collected within
the device. This is a new fea- ture in SBC-2 and can
probably be ignored for the time being.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-i, --immed sets the IMMED bit in the SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
command. This instructs the device, if the format of the
command is accept- able, to return a GOOD status immediately
rather than wait for the blocks in the (volatile) cache to
be synchronized with (i.e. written to) the medium (or the
non-volatile cache).</p>

<p>-l, --lba=LBA where LBA is the lowest logical block
address in the (volatile) cache to synchronize to the medium
(or the non-volatile cache). Default value is 0 .</p>

<p>-s, --sync-nv synchronize the (volatile) cache with the
non-volatile cache. Without this option (or if there is no
non-volatile cache in the device) the synchronization is
with the medium.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suf- fixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_sync is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
