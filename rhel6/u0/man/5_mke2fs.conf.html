<p>NAME mke2fs.conf - Configuration file for mke2fs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mke2fs.conf is the configuration file for
mke2fs(8). It controls the default parameters used by
mke2fs(8) when it is creating ext2 or ext3 filesystems.</p>

<p>The mke2fs.conf file uses an INI-style format. Stanzas,
or top-level sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].
Within each section, each line defines a relation, which
assigns tags to values, or to a subsection, which contains
further relations or subsections. An exam- ple of the
INI-style format used by this configuration file follows
below:</p>

<p>[section1] tag1 = value_a tag1 = value_b tag2 =
value_c</p>

<p>[section 2] tag3 = { subtag1 = subtag_value_a subtag1 =
subtag_value_b subtag2 = subtag_value_c } tag1 = value_d
tag2 = value_e }</p>

<p>Comments are delimited by a semicolon (;) or a hash (#)
character at the beginning of the comment, and are
terminated by the end of line character.</p>

<p>Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if
they contain spaces. Within a quoted string, the standard
backslash interpretations apply: &quot;0 (for the newline
character), &quot;&quot; (for the tab character), ( f o r t
h e b a c k s p a c &quot;e\&quot; (for the backslash
charac- c h a r a c t e r ) , a n d ter).</p>

<p>The following stanzas are used in the mke2fs.conf file.
They will be described in more detail in future sections of
this document.</p>

<p>[defaults] Contains relations which define the default
parameters used by mke2fs(8). In general, these defaults may
be overridden by a definition in the fs_types stanza, or by
an command-line option provided by the user.</p>

<p>[fs_types] Contains relations which define defaults that
should be used for specific filesystem types. The filesystem
type can be specified explicitly using the -T option to
mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>THE [defaults] STANZA The following relations are
defined in the [defaults] stanza.</p>

<p>base_features This relation specifies the filesystems
features which are enabled in newly created filesystems. It
may be overridden by the base_features relation found in the
filesystem or usage type subsection of the [fs_types]
stanza.</p>

<p>default_features This relation specifies a set of
features that should be added or removed to the features
listed in the base_features relation. It may be overridden
by the filesystem-specific default_features in the
filesystem or usage type subsection of [fs_types], and by
the -O command-line option to mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>force_undo This relation, if set to a boolean value of
true, forces mke2fs to always try to create an undo file,
even if the undo file might be huge and it might extend the
time to create the filesystem image because the inode table
isnt being initialized lazily.</p>

<p>fs_type This relation specifies the default filesystem
type if the user does not specify it via the -t option, or
if mke2fs is not started using a program name of the form
mkfs.fs-type. If both the user and the mke2fs.conf file does
not specify a default filesystem type, mke2fs will use a
default filesystem type of ext3 if a journal was requested
via a command-line option, or ext2 if not.</p>

<p>blocksize This relation specifies the default blocksize
if the user does not specify a blocksize on the command
line, and the filesystem- type specific section of the
configuration file does not specify a blocksize.</p>

<p>hash_alg This relation specifies the default hash
algorithm used for the new filesystems with hashed b-tree
directories. Valid algo- rithms accepted are: legacy,
half_md4, and tea.</p>

<p>inode_ratio This relation specifies the default inode
ratio if the user does not specify one on the command line,
and the filesystem-type specific section of the
configuration file does not specify a default inode
ratio.</p>

<p>inode_size This relation specifies the default inode
size if the user does not specify one on the command line,
and the filesystem-type specific section of the
configuration file does not specify a default inode
size.</p>

<p>undo_dir This relation specifies the directory where the
undo file should be stored. It can be overridden via the
E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR environment variable. If the directory
location is set to the value none, mke2fs will not create an
undo file.</p>

<p>THE [fs_types] STANZA Each tag in the [fs_types] stanza
names a filesystem type or usage type which can be specified
via the -t or -T options to mke2fs(8), respec- tively.</p>

<p>The mke2fs program constructs a list of fs_types by
concatenating the filesystem type (i.e., ext2, ext3, etc.)
with the usage type list. For most configuration options,
mke2fs will look for a subsection in the [fs_types] stanza
corresponding with each entry in the constructed list, with
later entries overriding earlier filesystem or usage types.
For example, consider the following mke2fs.conf
fragment:</p>

<p>[defaults] base_features =
sparse_super,filetype,resize_inode,dir_index blocksize =
4096 inode_size = 256 inode_ratio = 16384</p>

<p>[fs_types] ext3 = { features = has_journal } ext4 = {
features = extents,flex_bg inode_size = 256 } small = {
blocksize = 1024 inode_ratio = 4096 } floppy = { features =
^resize_inode blocksize = 1024 inode_size = 128 }</p>

<p>If mke2fs started with a program name of mke2fs.ext4,
then the filesys- tem type of ext4 will be used. If the
filesystem is smaller than 3 megabytes, and no usage type is
specified, then mke2fs will use a default usage type of
floppy. This results in an fs_types list of &quot;ext4,
floppy&quot;. Both the ext4 subsection and the floppy
subsection define an inode_size relation, but since the
later entries in the fs_types list supersede earlier ones,
the configuration parameter for fs_types.floppy.inode_size
will be used, so the filesystem will have an inode size of
128.</p>

<p>The exception to this resolution is the features tag,
which is speci- fies a set of changes to the features used
by the filesystem, and which is cumulative. So in the above
example, first the configuration rela- tion
defaults.base_features would enable an initial feature set
with the sparse_super, filetype, resize_inode, and dir_index
features enabled. Then configuration relation
fs_types.ext4.features would enable the extents and flex_bg
features, and finally the configuration relation
fs_types.floppy.features would remove the resize_inode fea-
ture, resulting in a filesystem feature set consisting of
the sparse_super, filetype, resize_inode, dir_index,
extents_and flex_bg features.</p>

<p>For each filesystem type, the following tags may be used
in that fs_types subsection:</p>

<p>base_features This relation specifies the features which
are initially enabled for this filesystem type. Only one
base_features will be used, so if there are multiple entries
in the fs_types list whose sub- sections define the
base_features relation, only the last will be used by
mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>features This relation specifies a comma-separated list
of features edit requests which modify the feature set used
by the newly con- structed filesystem. The syntax is the
same as the -O command- line option to mke2fs(8); that is, a
feature can be prefixed by a caret (^) symbol to disable a
named feature. Each feature relation specified in the
fs_types list will be applied in the order found in the
fs_types list.</p>

<p>default_features This relation specifies set of features
which should be enabled or disabled after applying the
features listed in the base_features and features relations.
It may be overridden by the -O command-line option to
mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>blocksize This relation specifies the default blocksize
if the user does not specify a blocksize on the command
line.</p>

<p>lazy_itable_init This relation is a boolean which
specifies whether the inode ta- ble should be lazily
initialized. It only has meaning if the uninit_bg feature is
enabled. If lazy_itable_init is true and the uninit_bg
feature is enabled, the inode table will not fully
initialized by mke2fs(8). This speeds up filesystem ini-
tialization noticeably, but it requires the kernel to finish
initializing the filesystem in the background when the
filesys- tem is first mounted.</p>

<p>inode_ratio This relation specifies the default inode
ratio if the user does not specify one on the command
line.</p>

<p>inode_size This relation specifies the default inode
size if the user does not specify one on the command
line.</p>

<p>hash_alg This relation specifies the default hash
algorithm used for the new filesystems with hashed b-tree
directories. Valid algo- rithms accepted are: legacy,
half_md4, and tea.</p>

<p>flex_bg_size This relation specifies the number of block
goups that will be packed together to create one large
virtual block group on an ext4 filesystem. This improves
meta-data locality and perfor- mance on meta-data heavy
workloads. The number of goups must be a power of 2 and may
only be specified if the flex_bg filesystem feature is
enabled. options This relation specifies additional extended
options which should be treated by mke2fs(8) as if they were
prepended to the argument of the -E option. This can be used
to configure the default extended options used by mke2fs(8)
on a per-filesystem type basis.</p>
