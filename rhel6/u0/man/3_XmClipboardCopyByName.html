<p>NAME XmClipboardCopyByName A clipboard function that
copies a data item passed by name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardCopyByName (display, window, data_id, buffer,
length, private_id) Display * display; Window window; long
data_id; XtPointer buffer; unsigned long length; long
private_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardCopyByName copies the actual data
for a data item that was previously passed by name to the
clipboard. Data is considered to be passed by name when a
call to XmClipboardCopy is made with a NULL buffer
parameter. Additional calls to this function append new data
to the existing data.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
clipboard function it calls.</p>

<p>data_id Specifies an identifying number assigned to the
data item that uniquely identifies the data item and the
format. This number was assigned by XmClipboardCopy to the
data item.</p>

<p>buffer Specifies the buffer from which the clipboard
copies the data.</p>

<p>length Specifies the number of bytes in the data
item.</p>

<p>private_id Specifies the private data that the
application wants to store with the data item.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
