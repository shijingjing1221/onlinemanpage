<p>FAX(1) FAX(1)</p>

<p>NAME fax - make, send, receive, view or print a fax</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fax help</p>

<p>fax make [-l] file</p>

<p>fax send [-l] [-v] { -m | number } filename...</p>

<p>fax [ receive [-v] [ filename-prefix ] ]</p>

<p>fax { print | view | rm } filename...</p>

<p>fax { queue | status [t] | start | stop }</p>

<p>fax answer</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l use low (96 line per inch) resolution</p>

<p>-v display verbose messages for debugging</p>

<p>-m the phone call has already been dialed manually</p>

<p>The commands make, send, receive, view and queue may be
abbreviated to their first characters (e.g. fax q).</p>

<p>Assignments of the form VARIABLE=value may appear before
the command name to temporarily change the values of most
fax script variables (e.g. fax PAGE=A4 print letter.001)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fax provides a simple user interface to the
efax(1) and efix(1) pro- grams. It allows you to send text
or Postscript files as faxes and receive, print or preview
received faxes. The fax help command prints a summary of the
possible commands.</p>

<p>To send a fax, the original files need to be converted
from ASCII or Postscript into a particular bit-map format
(TIFF with Group 3 encod- ing). This can be done
automatically by the fax send command or you can use the fax
make command to do the conversion before sending the fax.
The conversion will create one file per page. These files
will have the name of the original file with the page number
as an addi- tional suffix. For example, running fax make
doc.ps on the two-page postscript file doc.ps would generate
the files doc.ps.001 and doc.ps.002.</p>

<p>When sending a fax with the fax send command you may
dial the number manually and use the -m option or you may
give the phone number on the command line. The names of the
files to be sent are given on the com- mand line, usually by
using wildcards. For example, to send a multi- page fax
consisting of the files doc.ps.001, doc.ps.002, and so on,
you could use the command fax send 555-1212 doc.ps.0* (if
you had already run the fax make command) or simply fax send
555-1212 doc.ps. If the number is busy the script will wait
and try again.</p>

<p>Use the fax receive command to answer the phone and
receive a fax. If a file name is specified the received fax
will be stored in files with the given file name plus an
extension equal to the page number. If no options are given,
the received fax will be stored in files having a name given
by the date and time and an extension equal to the page num-
ber. For example, a fax received beginning on July 4 at
3:05:20 pm will generate files 0704150520.001,
0704150520.002, and so on.</p>

<p>The fax print, fax view, and fax rm commands are used to
print, preview or remove received fax files. As with the
send command the file names are usually given using
wildcards.</p>

<p>If efax has been installed for automatic fax reception
you can use the fax queue command to check for files in the
incoming spool directory. The fax script can also be
configured to print received faxes or e-mail them as MIME
attachments with type image/tiff-f. For convenience the fax
print, view and rm commands will first check for the named
files in this spool directory. The fax status command shows
the status of the automatic receive process once, or every t
seconds. Privileged users can use the fax stop and fax start
commands to stop and restart the fax reception daemon.</p>

<p>The fax answer command is used for unattended reception
of faxes. It is normally placed in the inittab(5) or
ttytab(5) file and is run auto- matically by init(8).</p>

<p>The -v option displays verbose messages.</p>

<p>Other features of the fax script are documented within
the script:</p>

<p>- a directory that lets you specify recipients by name
instead of num- ber</p>

<p>- the fax new command to create a simple cover page and
start up a text editor</p>

<p>- the fax makefont command converts a Postscript font to
a bit-mapped font for use in headers or text</p>

<p>RESOLUTION Faxes can be created at low (98 lines per
inch) or high (196 lpi) reso- lution. Almost all fax
machines will operate at either resolution. By default files
are created at high resolution but you can use the optional
-l argument to create files at low resolution.</p>

<p>SESSION LOGS The modem commands and responses together
with status and error mes- sages are written to file. If the
fax is successfully sent or received the log file is
removed. Otherwise a message is printed showing the log file
name. Please send a copy of this file when reporting
problems with efax.</p>

<p>FILES The fax script will source the optional shell
scripts /etc/efax.rc, ~/.efaxrc and/or ./.efaxrc before
processing command-line arguments. These files can be used
to set script variables to custom values for a particular
system, user and/or directory.</p>

<p>The following files are created in the FAXDIR spool
directory when automatic fax reception is enabled (see the
fax script). DEV represents the name of the fax modem device
file in /dev (e.g. cua1 for /dev/cua1).</p>

<p>DEV.n the log file created by the fax answer daemon with
process id n</p>

<p>DEV.log contains collected log files for device DEV. Log
files show- ing a termination status of 1 (device busy) or 4
(no response from modem) are not added to this file.</p>

<p>DEV.stop created by the fax stop command to prevent the
fax daemon from starting up.</p>
