<p>RNDC-CONFGEN(8) BIND9 RNDC-CONFGEN(8)</p>

<p>NAME rndc-confgen - rndc key generation tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rndc-confgen [-a] [-b keysize] [-c keyfile]
[-h] [-k keyname] [-p port] [-r randomfile] [-s address] [-t
chrootdir] [-u user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rndc-confgen generates configuration files
for rndc. It can be used as a convenient alternative to
writing the rndc.conf file and the corresponding controls
and key statements in named.conf by hand. Alternatively, it
can be run with the -a option to set up a rndc.key file and
avoid the need for a rndc.conf file and a controls statement
altogether.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Do automatic rndc configuration. This creates
a file rndc.key in /etc (or whatever sysconfdir was
specified as when BIND was built) that is read by both rndc
and named on startup. The rndc.key file defines a default
command channel and authentication key allowing rndc to
communicate with named on the local host with no further
configuration.</p>

<p>Running rndc-confgen -a allows BIND 9 and rndc to be
used as drop-in replacements for BIND 8 and ndc, with no
changes to the existing BIND 8 named.conf file.</p>

<p>If a more elaborate configuration than that generated by
rndc-confgen -a is required, for example if rndc is to be
used remotely, you should run rndc-confgen without the -a
option and set up a rndc.conf and named.conf as
directed.</p>

<p>-b keysize Specifies the size of the authentication key
in bits. Must be between 1 and 512 bits; the default is
128.</p>

<p>-c keyfile Used with the -a option to specify an
alternate location for rndc.key.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to rndc-confgen.</p>

<p>-k keyname Specifies the key name of the rndc
authentication key. This must be a valid domain name. The
default is rndc-key.</p>

<p>-p port Specifies the command channel port where named
listens for connections from rndc. The default is 953.</p>

<p>-r randomfile Specifies a source of random data for
generating the authorization. If the operating system does
not provide a /dev/random or equivalent device, the default
source of randomness is keyboard input. randomdev specifies
the name of a character device or file containing random
data to be used instead of the default. The special value
keyboard indicates that keyboard input should be used.</p>

<p>-s address Specifies the IP address where named listens
for command channel connections from rndc. The default is
the loopback address 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>-t chrootdir Used with the -a option to specify a
directory where named will run chrooted. An additional copy
of the rndc.key will be written relative to this directory
so that it will be found by the chrooted named.</p>

<p>-u user Used with the -a option to set the owner of the
rndc.key file generated. If -t is also specified only the
file in the chroot area has its owner changed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To allow rndc to be used with no manual
configuration, run</p>

<p>rndc-confgen -a</p>

<p>To print a sample rndc.conf file and corresponding
controls and key statements to be manually inserted into
named.conf, run</p>

<p>rndc-confgen</p>
