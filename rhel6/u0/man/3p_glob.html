<p>GLOB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GLOB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME glob, globfree - generate pathnames matching a
pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;glob.h&gt;</p>

<p>int glob(const char *restrict pattern, int flags,
int(*errfunc)(const char *epath, int eerrno), glob_t
*restrict pglob); void globfree(glob_t *pglob);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The glob() function is a pathname generator
that shall implement the rules defined in the Shell and
Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 2.13,
Pattern Matching Notation, with optional support for rule 3
in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 2.13.3, Patterns Used for Filename Expan- sion.</p>

<p>The structure type glob_t is defined in &lt;glob.h&gt;
and includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>Member Type Member Name Description size_t gl_pathc
Count of paths matched by pattern. char ** gl_pathv Pointer
to a list of matched pathnames. size_t gl_offs Slots to
reserve at the beginning of gl_pathv.</p>

<p>The argument pattern is a pointer to a pathname pattern
to be expanded. The glob() function shall match all
accessible pathnames against this pattern and develop a list
of all pathnames that match. In order to have access to a
pathname, glob() requires search permission on every
component of a path except the last, and read permission on
each direc- tory of any filename component of pattern that
contains any of the fol- lowing special characters:,,
and[.</p>

<p>The glob() function shall store the number of matched
pathnames into pglob-&gt;gl_pathc and a pointer to a list of
pointers to pathnames into pglob-&gt;gl_pathv. The pathnames
shall be in sort order as defined by the current setting of
the LC_COLLATE category; see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.2, LC_COLLATE. The first
pointer after the last pathname shall be a null pointer. If
the pattern does not match any pathnames, the returned
number of matched paths is set to 0, and the contents of
pglob-&gt;gl_pathv are implementation- defined.</p>

<p>It is the callers responsibility to create the structure
pointed to by pglob. The glob() function shall allocate
other space as needed, including the memory pointed to by
gl_pathv. The globfree() function shall free any space
associated with pglob from a previous call to glob().</p>

<p>The flags argument is used to control the behavior of
glob(). The value of flags is a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero
or more of the follow- ing constants, which are defined in
&lt;glob.h&gt;:</p>

<p>GLOB_APPEND Append pathnames generated to the ones from
a previous call to glob().</p>

<p>GLOB_DOOFFS Make use of pglob-&gt;gl_offs. If this flag
is set, pglob-&gt;gl_offs is used to specify how many null
pointers to add to the begin- ning of pglob-&gt;gl_pathv. In
other words, pglob-&gt;gl_pathv shall point to
pglob-&gt;gl_offs null pointers, followed by
pglob-&gt;gl_pathc pathname pointers, followed by a null
pointer.</p>

<p>GLOB_ERR Cause glob() to return when it encounters a
directory that it cannot open or read. Ordinarily, glob()
continues to find matches.</p>

<p>GLOB_MARK Each pathname that is a directory that matches
pattern shall have a slash appended.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOCHECK Supports rule 3 in the Shell and Utilities
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 2.13.3, Patterns
Used for Filename Expansion. If pattern does not match any
pathname, then glob() shall return a list consisting of only
pattern, and the number of matched pathnames is 1.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOSORT Ordinarily, glob() sorts the matching
pathnames according to the current setting of the LC_COLLATE
category; see the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.2, LC_COLLATE. When this flag is
used, the order of pathnames returned is unspecified.</p>

<p>The GLOB_APPEND flag can be used to append a new set of
pathnames to those found in a previous call to glob(). The
following rules apply to applications when two or more calls
to glob() are made with the same value of pglob and without
intervening calls to globfree():</p>

<p>1. The first such call shall not set GLOB_APPEND. All
subsequent calls shall set it.</p>

<p>2. All the calls shall set GLOB_DOOFFS, or all shall not
set it.</p>

<p>3. After the second call, pglob-&gt;gl_pathv points to a
list containing the following:</p>

<p>a. Zero or more null pointers, as specified by
GLOB_DOOFFS and pglob-&gt;gl_offs.</p>

<p>b. Pointers to the pathnames that were in the
pglob-&gt;gl_pathv list before the call, in the same order
as before.</p>

<p>c. Pointers to the new pathnames generated by the second
call, in the specified order.</p>

<p>4. The count returned in pglob-&gt;gl_pathc shall be the
total number of pathnames from the two calls.</p>

<p>5. The application can change any of the fields after a
call to glob(). If it does, the application shall reset them
to the origi- nal value before a subsequent call, using the
same pglob value, to globfree() or glob() with the
GLOB_APPEND flag.</p>

<p>If, during the search, a directory is encountered that
cannot be opened or read and errfunc is not a null pointer,
glob() calls (*errfunc()) with two arguments:</p>

<p>1. The epath argument is a pointer to the path that
failed.</p>

<p>2. The eerrno argument is the value of errno from the
failure, as set by opendir(), readdir(), or stat(). (Other
values may be used to report other errors not explicitly
documented for those functions.)</p>

<p>If (*errfunc()) is called and returns non-zero, or if
the GLOB_ERR flag is set in flags, glob() shall stop the
scan and return GLOB_ABORTED after setting gl_pathc and
gl_pathv in pglob to reflect the paths already scanned. If
GLOB_ERR is not set and either errfunc is a null pointer or
(*errfunc()) returns 0, the error shall be ignored.</p>

<p>The glob() function shall not fail because of large
files.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, glob() shall
return 0. The argument pglob-&gt;gl_pathc shall return the
number of matched pathnames and the argument
pglob-&gt;gl_pathv shall contain a pointer to a
null-terminated list of matched and sorted pathnames.
However, if pglob-&gt;gl_pathc is 0, the content of
pglob-&gt;gl_pathv is undefined.</p>

<p>The globfree() function shall not return a value.</p>

<p>If glob() terminates due to an error, it shall return
one of the non- zero constants defined in &lt;glob.h&gt;.
The arguments pglob-&gt;gl_pathc and pglob-&gt;gl_pathv are
still set as defined above.</p>

<p>ERRORS The glob() function shall fail and return the
corresponding value if:</p>

<p>GLOB_ABORTED The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was
set or (*errfunc()) returned non-zero.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOMATCH The pattern does not match any existing
pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK was not set in flags.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOSPACE An attempt to allocate memory failed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES One use of the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is by
applications that build an argu- ment list for use with
execv(), execve(), or execvp(). Suppose, for example, that
an application wants to do the equivalent of:</p>

<p>ls -l *.c</p>

<p>but for some reason:</p>

<p>system(&quot;ls -l *.c&quot;)</p>

<p>is not acceptable. The application could obtain
approximately the same result using the sequence:</p>

<p>globbuf.gl_offs = 2; glob(&quot;*.c&quot;, GLOB_DOOFFS,
NULL, &amp;globbuf); globbuf.gl_pathv[0] = &quot;ls&quot;;
globbuf.gl_pathv[1] = &quot;-l&quot;; execvp(&quot;ls&quot;,
&amp;globbuf.gl_pathv[0]);</p>

<p>Using the same example:</p>

<p>ls -l *.c *.h</p>

<p>could be approximately simulated using GLOB_APPEND as
follows:</p>

<p>globbuf.gl_offs = 2; glob(&quot;*.c&quot;, GLOB_DOOFFS,
NULL, &amp;globbuf); glob(&quot;*.h&quot;,
GLOB_DOOFFS|GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &amp;globbuf); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function is not provided for the
purpose of enabling utilities to perform pathname expansion
on their arguments, as this operation is performed by the
shell, and utilities are explicitly not expected to redo
this. Instead, it is provided for applications that need to
do pathname expansion on strings obtained from other
sources, such as a pattern typed by a user or read from a
file.</p>

<p>If a utility needs to see if a pathname matches a given
pattern, it can use fnmatch().</p>

<p>Note that gl_pathc and gl_pathv have meaning even if
glob() fails. This allows glob() to report partial results
in the event of an error. How- ever, if gl_pathc is 0,
gl_pathv is unspecified even if glob() did not return an
error.</p>

<p>The GLOB_NOCHECK option could be used when an
application wants to expand a pathname if wildcards are
specified, but wants to treat the pattern as just a string
otherwise. The sh utility might use this for
option-arguments, for example.</p>

<p>The new pathnames generated by a subsequent call with
GLOB_APPEND are not sorted together with the previous
pathnames. This mirrors the way that the shell handles
pathname expansion when multiple expansions are done on a
command line.</p>

<p>Applications that need tilde and parameter expansion
should use word- exp().</p>

<p>RATIONALE It was claimed that the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is
unnecessary because it could be simulated using:</p>

<p>new = (char **)malloc((n + pglob-&gt;gl_pathc + 1) *
sizeof(char *)); (void) memcpy(new+n, pglob-&gt;gl_pathv,
pglob-&gt;gl_pathc * sizeof(char *)); (void) memset(new, 0,
n * sizeof(char *)); free(pglob-&gt;gl_pathv);
pglob-&gt;gl_pathv = new;</p>

<p>However, this assumes that the memory pointed to by
gl_pathv is a block that was separately created using
malloc(). This is not necessarily the case. An application
should make no assumptions about how the memory referenced
by fields in pglob was allocated. It might have been
obtained from malloc() in a large chunk and then carved up
within glob(), or it might have been created using a
different memory alloca- tor. It is not the intent of the
standard developers to specify or imply how the memory used
by glob() is managed.</p>

<p>The GLOB_APPEND flag would be used when an application
wants to expand several different patterns into a single
list.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
