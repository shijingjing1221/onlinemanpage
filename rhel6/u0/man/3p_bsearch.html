<p>BSEARCH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BSEARCH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bsearch - binary search a sorted table</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *bsearch(const void *key, const void *base, size_t
nel, size_t width, int (*compar)(const void *, const void
*));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bsearch() function shall search an array
of nel objects, the ini- tial element of which is pointed to
by base, for an element that matches the object pointed to
by key. The size of each element in the array is specified
by width. If the nel argument has the value zero, the
comparison function pointed to by compar shall not be called
and no match shall be found.</p>

<p>The comparison function pointed to by compar shall be
called with two arguments that point to the key object and
to an array element, in that order.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the comparison
function pointed to by compar does not alter the contents of
the array. The implementation may reorder elements of the
array between calls to the comparison func- tion, but shall
not alter the contents of any individual element.</p>

<p>The implementation shall ensure that the first argument
is always a pointer to the key.</p>

<p>When the same objects (consisting of width bytes,
irrespective of their current positions in the array) are
passed more than once to the com- parison function, the
results shall be consistent with one another. That is, the
same object shall always compare the same way with the
key.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the function returns
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0 if the key
object is considered, respectively, to be less than, to
match, or to be greater than the array element. The
application shall ensure that the array consists of all the
elements that compare less than, all the elements that
compare equal to, and all the elements that compare greater
than the key object, in that order.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The bsearch() function shall return a
pointer to a matching member of the array, or a null pointer
if no match is found. If two or more mem- bers compare
equal, which member is returned is unspecified.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The example below searches a table containing
pointers to nodes con- sisting of a string and its length.
The table is ordered alphabetically on the string in the
node pointed to by each entry.</p>

<p>The code fragment below reads in strings and either
finds the corre- sponding node and prints out the string and
its length, or prints an error message.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define TABSIZE 1000</p>

<p>struct node { /* These are stored in the table. */ char
*string; int length; }; struct node table[TABSIZE]; /* Table
to be searched. */ . . . { struct node *node_ptr, node; /*
Routine to compare 2 nodes. */ int node_compare(const void
*, const void *); char str_space[20]; /* Space to read
string into. */ . . . node.string = str_space; while
(scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, node.string) != EOF) { node_ptr =
(struct node *)bsearch((void *)(&amp;node), (void *)table,
TABSIZE, sizeof(struct node), node_compare); if (node_ptr !=
NULL) { (void)printf(&quot;string = %20s, length = %n&quot;,
node_ptr-&gt;string, node_ptr-&gt;length); } else {
(void)printf(&quot;not found: %n&quot;, node.string); } } }
/* This routine compares two nodes based on an alphabetical
ordering of the string field. */ int node_compare(const void
*node1, const void *node2) { return strcoll(((const struct
node *)node1)-&gt;string, ((const struct node
*)node2)-&gt;string); }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pointers to the key and the
element at the base of the table should be of type
pointer-to-element.</p>

<p>The comparison function need not compare every byte, so
arbitrary data may be contained in the elements in addition
to the values being com- pared.</p>

<p>In practice, the array is usually sorted according to
the comparison function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The requirement that the second argument
(hereafter referred to as p) to the comparison function is a
pointer to an element of the array implies that for every
call all of the following expressions are non- zero:</p>

<p>((char *)p - (char *(base) % width == 0 (char *)p &gt;=
(char *)base (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
