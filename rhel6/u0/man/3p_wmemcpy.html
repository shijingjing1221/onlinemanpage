<p>WMEMCPY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WMEMCPY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wmemcpy - copy wide characters in memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wmemcpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wmemcpy() function shall copy n wide
characters from the object pointed to by ws2 to the object
pointed to by ws1. This function shall not be affected by
locale and all wchar_t values shall be treated iden-
tically. The null wide character and wchar_t values not
corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated
specially.</p>

<p>If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and
ws2 are valid pointers, and the function shall copy zero
wide characters.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wmemcpy() function shall return the
value of ws1.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
