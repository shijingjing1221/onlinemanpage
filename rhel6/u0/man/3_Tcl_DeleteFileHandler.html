<p>Tcl_CreateFileHandler(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_CreateFileHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CreateFileHandler, Tcl_DeleteFileHandler -
associate procedure callbacks with files or devices (Unix
only)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateFileHandler(fd, mask, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler(fd)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int fd (in) Unix file descriptor for an open
file or device.</p>

<p>int mask (in) Conditions under which proc should be
called: OR-ed combina- tion of TCL_READABLE, TCL_WRITABLE,
and TCL_EXCEPTION. May be set to 0 to temporarily disable a
handler.</p>

<p>Tcl_FileProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke whenever the
file or device indicated by file meets the conditions
specified by mask.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CreateFileHandler arranges for proc to
be invoked in the future whenever I/O becomes possible on a
file or an exceptional condition exists for the file. The
file is indicated by fd, and the conditions of interest are
indicated by mask. For example, if mask is TCL_READ- ABLE,
proc will be called when the file is readable. The callback
to proc is made by Tcl_DoOneEvent, so Tcl_CreateFileHandler
is only useful in programs that dispatch events through
Tcl_DoOneEvent or through Tcl commands such as vwait.</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tcl_FileProc: typedef void Tcl_FileProc( ClientData
clientData, int mask); The clientData parameter to proc is a
copy of the clientData argument given to
Tcl_CreateFileHandler when the callback was created. Typi-
cally, clientData points to a data structure containing
application- specific information about the file. Mask is an
integer mask indicat- ing which of the requested conditions
actually exists for the file; it will contain a subset of
the bits in the mask argument to Tcl_Create-
FileHandler.</p>

<p>There may exist only one handler for a given file at a
given time. If Tcl_CreateFileHandler is called when a
handler already exists for fd, then the new callback
replaces the information that was previously recorded.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler may be called to delete the file
handler for fd; if no handler exists for the file given by
fd then the procedure has no effect.</p>

<p>The purpose of file handlers is to enable an application
to respond to events while waiting for files to become ready
for I/O. For this to work correctly, the application may
need to use non-blocking I/O opera- tions on the files for
which handlers are declared. Otherwise the application may
block if it reads or writes too much data; while wait- ing
for the I/O to complete the application will not be able to
service other events. Use Tcl_SetChannelOption with
-blocking to set the chan- nel into blocking or nonblocking
mode as required.</p>

<p>Note that these interfaces are only supported by the
Unix implementa- tion of the Tcl notifier.</p>
