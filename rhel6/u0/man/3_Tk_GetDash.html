<p>Tk_GetDash(3) Tk Library Procedures Tk_GetDash(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_GetDash - convert from string to valid dash
structure.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_GetDash(interp, string, dashPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error reporting.</p>

<p>const char * string (in) Textual value to be
converted.</p>

<p>Tk_Dash *dashPtr (out) Points to place to store the dash
pat- tern value converted from string.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedure parses the string and fills
in the result in the Tk_Dash structure. The string can be a
list of integers or a character string containing only .,-_
or spaces. If all goes well, TCL_OK is returned. If string
does not have the proper syntax then TCL_ERROR is returned,
an error message is left in the interpreters result, and
nothing is stored at *dashPtr.</p>

<p>The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each
element repre- sents the number of pixels of a line segment.
Only the odd segments are drawn using the outline color. The
other segments are drawn transpar- ent.</p>

<p>The second possible syntax is a character list
containing only 5 possi- ble characters .,-_ . The space can
be used to enlarge the space between other line elements,
and can not occur as the first position in the string. Some
examples: -dash . = -dash {2 4} -dash - = -dash {6 4} -dash
-. = -dash {6 4 2 4} -dash -.. = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4} -dash
{. } = -dash {2 8} -dash , = -dash {4 4}</p>

<p>The main difference of this syntax with the previous is
that it is shape-conserving. This means that all values in
the dash list will be multiplied by the line width before
display. This assures that . will always be displayed as a
dot and - always as a dash regardless of the line width.</p>

<p>On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns,
the dash pattern will be displayed as the most close dash
pattern that is available. For example, on Windows only the
first 4 of the above examples are avail- able. The last 2
examples will be displayed identically as the first one.</p>
