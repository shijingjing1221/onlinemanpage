<p>IPSEC.SECRETS(5) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC.SECRETS(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec.secrets - secrets for IKE/IPsec
authentication</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file ipsec.secrets contains a list of
secrets, aka preshared secrets, RSA signatures, or pointers
to X.509 Digital Certificates. These secrets are used by
ipsec_pluto(8) , the Openswan Internet Key Exchange daemon,
to authenticate other hosts. Currently there are five kinds
of secrets: preshared secrets, RSA private keys, passphrases
for X.509 certificates and if compiled with USE_XAUTH=true
there is support for XAUTH static passwords. Smartcard
support has been moved to the NSS framework.</p>

<p>It is vital that these secrets be protected. The file
should be owned by root, and permissions should be set to
block all access by others. (eg: chmod 600)</p>

<p>The file is a sequence of entries and include
directives. Here is an example - each entry or directive
must start at the left margin, but if it continues beyond a
single line, each continuation line must be indented.</p>

<p>include ipsec.*.secrets # get secrets from other
files</p>

<p>Each entry in the file is a list of indices, followed by
a secret. The two parts are separated by a colon (:) that is
followed by whitespace or a newline. For compatibility with
the previous form of this file, if the key part is just a
double-quoted string the colon may be left out. If filenames
are not absolute paths, they are relative to the
ipsec.d/private/ directory.</p>

<p>An index is an IP address, or a Fully Qualified Domain
Name, user@FQDN, %any or %any6 (other kinds may come). An IP
address may be written in the familiar dotted quad form or
as a domain name to be looked up when the file is loaded (or
in any of the forms supported by the Openswan
ipsec_ttoaddr(3) routine). In many cases it is a bad idea to
use domain names because the name server may not be running
or may be insecure. To denote a Fully Qualified Domain Name
(as opposed to an IP address denoted by its domain name),
precede the name with an at sign (@).</p>

<p>Matching IDs with indices is fairly straightforward:
they have to be equal. In the case of a Road Warrior
connection, if an equal match is not found for the
Peer&acute;s ID, and it is in the form of an IP address, an
index of %any will match the peer&acute;s IP address if IPV4
and %any6 will match a the peer&acute;s IP address if IPV6.
Currently, the obsolete notation 0.0.0.0 may be used in
place of %any, but please stop doing this, as it will likely
stop working around Openswan v3.0.</p>

<p>This file is only read at startup time. If any changes
are made to this file, the pluto daemon should be told to
re-read this file using the command ipsec secrets or ipsec
auto --rereadsecrets. If there are any keyfiles protected by
a passphrase using %prompt, you will be prompted again to
enter these passphrases. To skip the prompting, just hit
return to skip unlocking that particular private key. Note
that currently there is no way to add a specific new entry -
it&acute;s all or nothing.</p>

<p>Smartcard support has been moved from Openswan to NSS.
Please see the NSS documentation on how to configure
smartcards.</p>

<p>An additional complexity arises in the case of
authentication by preshared secret: the responder will need
to look up the secret before the Peer&acute;s ID payload has
been decoded, so the ID used will be the IP address.</p>

<p>To authenticate a connection between two hosts, the
entry that most specifically matches the host and peer IDs
is used. An entry with no index will match any host and
peer. More specifically, an entry with one index will match
a host and peer if the index matches the host&acute;s ID
(the peer isn&acute;t considered). Still more specifically,
an entry with multiple indices will match a host and peer if
the host ID and peer ID each match one of the indices. If
the key is for an asymmetric authentication technique (i.e.
a public key system such as RSA), an entry with multiple
indices will match a host and peer even if only the host ID
matches an index (it is presumed that the multiple indices
are all identities of the host). It is acceptable for two
entries to be the best match as long as they agree about the
secret or private key.</p>

<p>Authentication by preshared secret requires that both
systems find the identical secret (the secret is not
actually transmitted by the IKE protocol). If both the host
and peer appear in the index list, the same entry will be
suitable for both systems so verbatim copying between
systems can be used. This naturally extends to larger groups
sharing the same secret. Thus multiple-index entries are
best for PSK authentication.</p>

<p>Authentication by RSA Signatures requires that each host
have its own private key. A host could reasonably use a
different private keys for different interfaces and for
different peers. But it would not be normal to share entries
between systems. Thus no-index and one-index forms of entry
often make sense for RSA Signature authentication.</p>

<p>The key part of an entry may start with a token
indicating the kind of key. RSA signifies RSA private key
and PSK signifies PreShared Key (case is ignored). For
compatability with previous forms of this file, PSK is the
default.</p>

<p>The token XAUTH indicates a eXtended Authentication
password. There should be one indice, and it should be in
the @FQDN format. The file will be searched with the XAUTH
username, which is usually provided in the configuration
file. XAUTH is otherwise identical to PSK in syntax.</p>

<p>If the RSA points to a filename, this is assumed to be a
PEM (or DER?) encoded X.509 private key. The private key may
be protected by a 3DES encryption. 1DES encrypted key files
will be rejected. If the private key is protected by a
passphrase and this passphrase is not specified in
ipsec.secrets, the connection cannot be automatically
started using auto=start, but instead must be brought up
using ipsec auto --up connname, upon which the user will be
prompted for the passphrase to unlock the private key
belonging to the X.509 certificate. PKCS#12 files, which
include the private key file, cannot be specified in
ipsec.secrets. Private keys can be extracted from PKCS#12
files using the following command: openssl pkcs12 -nocerts
-in clientCert.p12 -out clientKey.pem</p>

<p>A preshared secret is most conveniently represented as a
sequence of characters, delimited by the double-quote
character (&quot;). The sequence cannot contain a newline or
double-quote. Strictly speaking, the secret is actually the
sequence of bytes that is used in the file to represent the
sequence of characters (excluding the delimiters). A
preshared secret may also be represented, without quotes, in
any form supported by ipsec_ttodata(3).</p>

<p>An RSA private key is a composite of eight generally
large numbers. The notation used is a brace-enclosed list of
field name and value pairs (see the example above). A
suitable key, in a suitable format, may be generated by
ipsec_rsasigkey(8). The structure is very similar to that
used by BIND 8.2.2 or later, but note that the numbers must
have a 0s prefix if they are in base 64. The order of the
fields is fixed.</p>

<p>The first token an entry must start in the first column
of its line. Subsequent tokens must be separated by
whitespace, except for a colon token, which only needs to be
followed by whitespace. A newline is taken as whitespace,
but every line of an entry after the first must be
indented.</p>

<p>Whitespace at the end of a line is ignored (except in
the 0t notation for a key). At the start of line or after
whitespace, # and the following text up to the end of the
line is treated as a comment. Within entries, all lines must
be indented (except for lines with no tokens). Outside
entries, no line may be indented (this is to make sure that
the file layout reflects its structure).</p>

<p>An include directive causes the contents of the named
file to be processed before continuing with the current
file. The filename is subject to globbing as in sh(1), so
every file with a matching name is processed. Includes may
be nested to a modest depth (10, currently). If the filename
doesn&acute;t start with a /, the directory containing the
current file is prepended to the name. The include directive
is a line that starts with the word include, followed by
whitespace, followed by the filename (which must not contain
whitespace).</p>

0::0, it will match %any6.</p>
