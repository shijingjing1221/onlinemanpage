<p>NAME addgnupghome - Create .gnupg home directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS addgnupghome account_1
account_2...account_n</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If GnuPG is installed on a system with
existing user accounts, it is sometimes required to populate
the GnuPG home directory with existing files. Especially a
trustlist.txt and a keybox with some initial certificates
are often desired. This scripts help to do this by copy- ing
all files from /etc/skel/.gnupg to the home directories of
the accounts given on the command line. It takes care not to
overwrite existing GnuPG home directories.</p>

<p>addgnupghome is invoked by root as:</p>

<p>addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn</p>
