<p>VIRTUAL(5) VIRTUAL(5)</p>

<p>NAME virtual - Postfix virtual alias table format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmap /etc/postfix/virtual</p>

<p>postmap -q &quot;string&quot; /etc/postfix/virtual</p>

<p>postmap -q - /etc/postfix/virtual &lt;inputfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The optional virtual(5) alias table rewrites
recipient addresses for all local, all virtual, and all
remote mail destinations. This is unlike the aliases(5)
table which is used only for local(8) delivery. Virtual
aliasing is recursive, and is implemented by the Postfix
cleanup(8) daemon before mail is queued.</p>

<p>The main applications of virtual aliasing are:</p>

<p>&middot; To redirect mail for one address to one or more
addresses.</p>

<p>&middot; To implement virtual alias domains where all
addresses are aliased to addresses in other domains.</p>

<p>Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the
virtual mailbox domains that are implemented with the
Postfix virtual(8) mail delivery agent. With virtual mailbox
domains, each recipi- ent address can have its own
mailbox.</p>

<p>Virtual aliasing is applied only to recipient envelope
addresses, and does not affect message headers. Use
canonical(5) mapping to rewrite header and envelope
addresses in general.</p>

<p>Normally, the virtual(5) alias table is specified as a
text file that serves as input to the postmap(1) command.
The result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
&quot;postmap /etc/postfix/virtual&quot; to rebuild an
indexed file after changing the corresponding text file.</p>

<p>When the table is provided via other means such as NIS,
LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary
indexed files.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the table can be provided as a
regular-expression map where patterns are given as regular
expressions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.
In those case, the lookups are done in a slightly different
way as described below under &quot;REGULAR EXPRESSION
TABLES&quot; or &quot;TCP-BASED TABLES&quot;.</p>

<p>CASE FOLDING The search string is folded to lowercase
before database lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string
is not case folded with database types such as regexp: or
pcre: whose lookup fields can match both upper and lower
case.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT The input format for the postmap(1) command
is as follows:</p>

<p>pattern result When pattern matches a mail address,
replace it by the corre- sponding result.</p>

<p>blank lines and comments Empty lines and whitespace-only
lines are ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace
character is a #.</p>

<p>multi-line text A logical line starts with
non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace
continues a logical line.</p>

<p>TABLE SEARCH ORDER With lookups from indexed files such
as DB or DBM, or from networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or
SQL, patterns are tried in the order as listed below:</p>

<p>user@domain address, address, ... Redirect mail for
user@domain to address. This form has the highest
precedence.</p>

<p>user address, address, ... Redirect mail for user@site
to address when site is equal to $myorigin, when site is
listed in $mydestination, or when it is listed in
$inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.</p>

<p>This functionality overlaps with functionality of the
local aliases(5) database. The difference is that virtual(5)
mapping can be applied to non-local addresses.</p>

<p>@domain address, address, ... Redirect mail for other
users in domain to address. This form has the lowest
precedence.</p>

<p>Note: @domain is a wild-card. With this form, the
Postfix SMTP server accepts mail for any recipient in
domain, regardless of whether that recipient exists. This
may turn your mail system into a backscatter source: Postfix
first accepts mail for non- existent recipients and then
tries to return that mail as &quot;unde- liverable&quot; to
the often forged sender address.</p>

<p>RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING The lookup result is subject to
address rewriting:</p>

<p>&middot; When the result has the form @otherdomain, the
result becomes the same user in otherdomain. This works only
for the first address in a multi-address lookup result.</p>

<p>&middot; When &quot;append_at_myorigin=yes&quot;, append
&quot;@$myorigin&quot; to addresses without
&quot;@domain&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; When &quot;append_dot_mydomain=yes&quot;,
append &quot;.$mydomain&quot; to addresses without
&quot;.domain&quot;.</p>

<p>ADDRESS EXTENSION When a mail address localpart contains
the optional recipient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain),
the lookup order becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain,
user+foo, user, and @domain.</p>

<p>The propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter controls
whether an unmatched address extension (+foo) is propagated
to the result of table lookup.</p>

<p>VIRTUAL ALIAS DOMAINS Besides virtual aliases, the
virtual alias table can also be used to implement virtual
alias domains. With a virtual alias domain, all recipient
addresses are aliased to addresses in other domains.</p>

<p>Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the
virtual mailbox domains that are implemented with the
Postfix virtual(8) mail delivery agent. With virtual mailbox
domains, each recipient address can have its own
mailbox.</p>

<p>With a virtual alias domain, the virtual domain has its
own user name space. Local (i.e. non-virtual) usernames are
not visible in a virtual alias domain. In particular, local
aliases(5) and local mailing lists are not visible as
localname@virtual-alias.domain.</p>

<p>Support for a virtual alias domain looks like:</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/main.cf: virtual_alias_maps =
hash:/etc/postfix/virtual</p>

<p>Note: some systems use dbm databases instead of hash.
See the output from &quot;postconf -m&quot; for available
database types.</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/virtual: virtual-alias.domain anything
(right-hand content does not matter)
postmaster@virtual-alias.domain postmaster
user1@virtual-alias.domain address1
user2@virtual-alias.domain address2, address3</p>

<p>The virtual-alias.domain anything entry is required for
a virtual alias domain. Without this entry, mail is rejected
with &quot;relay access denied&quot;, or bounces with
&quot;mail loops back to myself&quot;.</p>

<p>Do not specify virtual alias domain names in the main.cf
mydestination or relay_domains configuration parameters.</p>

<p>With a virtual alias domain, the Postfix SMTP server
accepts mail for known-user@virtual-alias.domain, and
rejects mail for unknown-user@vir- tual-alias.domain as
undeliverable.</p>

<p>Instead of specifying the virtual alias domain name via
the vir- tual_alias_maps table, you may also specify it via
the main.cf vir- tual_alias_domains configuration parameter.
This latter parameter uses the same syntax as the main.cf
mydestination configuration parameter.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES This section describes how the
table lookups change when the table is given in the form of
regular expressions. For a description of regular expression
lookup table syntax, see regexp_table(5) or
pcre_table(5).</p>

<p>Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to
the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
addresses are not bro- ken up into their user and @domain
constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
foo.</p>

<p>Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the
table, until a pattern is found that matches the search
string.</p>

<p>Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
the pattern can be interpo- lated as $1, $2 and so on.</p>

<p>TCP-BASED TABLES This section describes how the table
lookups change when lookups are directed to a TCP-based
server. For a description of the TCP client/server lookup
protocol, see tcp_table(5). This feature is not available up
to and including Postfix version 2.4.</p>

<p>Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.
Thus, user@domain mail addresses are not broken up into
their user and @domain con- stituent parts, nor is user+foo
broken up into user and foo.</p>

<p>Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.</p>

<p>BUGS The table format does not understand quoting
conventions.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant to this topic. See the
Postfix main.cf file for syntax details and for default
values. Use the &quot;postfix reload&quot; command after a
configuration change.</p>

<p>virtual_alias_maps List of virtual aliasing tables.</p>

<p>virtual_alias_domains List of virtual alias domains.
This uses the same syntax as the mydestination
parameter.</p>

<p>propagate_unmatched_extensions A list of address
rewriting or forwarding mechanisms that propa- gate an
address extension from the original address to the result.
Specify zero or more of canonical, virtual, alias, for-
ward, include, or generic.</p>

<p>Other parameters of interest:</p>

<p>inet_interfaces The network interface addresses that
this system receives mail on. You need to stop and start
Postfix when this parameter changes.</p>

<p>mydestination List of domains that this mail system
considers local.</p>

<p>myorigin The domain that is appended to any address that
does not have a domain.</p>

<p>owner_request_special Give special treatment to
owner-xxx and xxx-request addresses.</p>

<p>proxy_interfaces Other interfaces that this machine
receives mail on by way of a proxy agent or network address
translator.</p>
