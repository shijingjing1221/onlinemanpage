<p>FSYNC(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FSYNC(2)</p>

<p>NAME fsync, fdatasync - synchronize a files in-core
state with storage device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fsync(int fd);</p>

<p>int fdatasync(int fd);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fsync(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE || /* since glibc
2.8: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L fdatasync():
_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 199309L || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fsync() transfers (&quot;flushes&quot;) all
modified in-core data of (i.e., modi- fied buffer cache
pages for) the file referred to by the file descrip- tor fd
to the disk device (or other permanent storage device) where
that file resides. The call blocks until the device reports
that the transfer has completed. It also flushes metadata
information associ- ated with the file (see stat(2)).</p>

<p>Calling fsync() does not necessarily ensure that the
entry in the directory containing the file has also reached
disk. For that an explicit fsync() on a file descriptor for
the directory is also needed.</p>

<p>fdatasync() is similar to fsync(), but does not flush
modified metadata unless that metadata is needed in order to
allow a subsequent data retrieval to be correctly handled.
For example, changes to st_atime or st_mtime (respectively,
time of last access and time of last modifica- tion; see
stat(2)) do not require flushing because they are not neces-
sary for a subsequent data read to be handled correctly. On
the other hand, a change to the file size (st_size, as made
by say ftruncate(2)), would require a metadata flush.</p>

<p>The aim of fdatasync() is to reduce disk activity for
applications that do not require all metadata to be
synchronized with the disk.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these system calls return zero.
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor open for
writing.</p>

<p>EIO An error occurred during synchronization.</p>

<p>EROFS, EINVAL fd is bound to a special file which does
not support synchro- nization.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which fdatasync() is
available, _POSIX_SYNCHRO- NIZED_IO is defined in
&lt;unistd.h&gt; to a value greater than 0. (See also
sysconf(3).)</p>

<p>NOTES Applications that access databases or log files
often write a tiny data fragment (e.g., one line in a log
file) and then call fsync() immedi- ately in order to ensure
that the written data is physically stored on the harddisk.
Unfortunately, fsync() will always initiate two write
operations: one for the newly written data and another one
in order to update the modification time stored in the
inode. If the modification time is not a part of the
transaction concept fdatasync() can be used to avoid
unnecessary inode disk write operations.</p>

<p>If the underlying hard disk has write caching enabled,
then the data may not really be on permanent storage when
fsync() / fdatasync() return.</p>

<p>When an ext2 file system is mounted with the sync
option, directory entries are also implicitly synced by
fsync().</p>

<p>On kernels before 2.4, fsync() on big files can be
inefficient. An alternative might be to use the O_SYNC flag
to open(2).</p>

<p>In Linux 2.2 and earlier, fdatasync() is equivalent to
fsync(), and so has no performance advantage.</p>
