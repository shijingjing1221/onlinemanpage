<p>SCRIPT(1) BSD General Commands Manual SCRIPT(1)</p>

<p>NAME script - make typescript of terminal session</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS script [-a] [-c COMMAND] [-f] [-q] [-t]
[file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Script makes a typescript of everything
printed on your terminal. It is useful for students who need
a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an
assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later
with lpr(1).</p>

<p>If the argument file is given, script saves all dialogue
in file. If no file name is given, the typescript is saved
in the file typescript.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-a Append the output to file or typescript, retaining
the prior con- tents.</p>

<p>-c COMMAND Run the COMMAND rather than an interactive
shell. This makes it easy for a script to capture the output
of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not
a tty.</p>

<p>-f Flush output after each write. This is nice for
telecooperation: One person does mkfifo foo; script -f foo
and another can supervise real-time what is being done using
cat foo .</p>

<p>-q Be quiet.</p>

<p>-t Output timing data to standard error. This data
contains two fields, separated by a space. The first field
indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.
The second field indi- cates how many characters were output
this time. This information can be used to replay
typescripts with realistic typing and out- put delays.</p>

<p>The script ends when the forked shell exits (a control-D
to exit the Bourne shell (sh(1)), and exit, logout or
control-d (if ignoreeof is not set) for the C-shell,
csh(1)).</p>

<p>Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create
garbage in the type- script file. Script works best with
commands that do not manipulate the screen, the results are
meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variable is
utilized by script:</p>

<p>SHELL If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by
script will be that shell. If SHELL is not set, the Bourne
shell is assumed. (Most shells set this variable
automatically).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO csh(1) (for the history mechanism),
scriptreplay(1).</p>

<p>HISTORY The script command appeared in 3.0BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS Script places everything in the log file, including
linefeeds and backspaces. This is not what the naive user
expects.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The script command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
