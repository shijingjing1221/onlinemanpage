<p>SCALBLN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SCALBLN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME scalbln, scalblnf, scalblnl, scalbn, scalbnf,
scalbnl - compute expo- nent using FLT_RADIX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double scalbln(double x, long n); float scalblnf(float
x, long n); long double scalblnl(long double x, long n);
double scalbn(double x, int n); float scalbnf(float x, int
n); long double scalbnl(long double x, int n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute x *
FLT_RADIX**n efficiently, not nor- mally by computing
FLT_RADIX**n explicitly.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return x * FLT_RADIX**n.</p>

<p>If the result would cause overflow, a range error shall
occur and these functions shall return &plusmn;HUGE_VAL,
&plusmn;HUGE_VALF, and &plusmn;HUGE_VALL (according to the
sign of x) as appropriate for the return type of the
function.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not
representable, a range error may occur, and either 0.0 (if
supported), or an implemen- tation-defined value shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0 or &plusmn;Inf, x shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If n is 0, x shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, and is
representable, a range error may occur and the correct value
shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result overflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result underflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE These functions are named so as to avoid
conflicting with the histori- cal definition of the scalb()
function from the Single UNIX Specifica- tion. The
difference is that the scalb() function has a second argu-
ment of double instead of int. The scalb() function is not
part of the ISO C standard. The three functions whose second
type is long are pro- vided because the factor required to
scale from the smallest positive floating-point value to the
largest finite one, on many implementa- tions, is too large
to represent in the minimum-width int format.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
