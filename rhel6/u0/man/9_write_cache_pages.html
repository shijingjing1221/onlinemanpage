<p>WRITE_CACHE_PAGES(9) Memory Management in Linux
WRITE_CACHE_PAGES(9)</p>

<p>NAME write_cache_pages - walk the list of dirty pages of
the given address space and write all of them.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int write_cache_pages(struct address_space *
mapping, struct writeback_control * wbc, writepage_t
writepage, void * data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mapping address space structure to write</p>

<p>wbc subtract the number of written pages from
*wbc-&gt;nr_to_write</p>

<p>writepage function called for each page</p>

<p>data data passed to writepage function</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If a page is already under I/O,
write_cache_pages skips it, even if it&acute;s dirty. This
is desirable behaviour for memory-cleaning writeback, but it
is INCORRECT for data-integrity system calls such as fsync.
fsync and msync need to guarantee that all the data which
was dirty at the time the call was made get new I/O started
against them. If wbc-&gt;sync_mode is WB_SYNC_ALL then we
were called for data integrity and we must wait for existing
IO to complete.</p>
