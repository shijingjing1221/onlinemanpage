<p>NAME ypbind - NIS binding process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ypbind [-c] [-d | -debug] [-verbose]
[-broadcast] [-broken-server] [-ypset] [-ypsetme] [-no-ping]
[-p port] [-f configfile] [-local-only] [-ping-interval
ping-interval] [-no-dbus]</p>

<p>ypbind --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ypbind finds the server for NIS domains and
maintains the NIS binding information. The client (normaly
the NIS routines in the standard C library) could get the
information over RPC from ypbind or read the binding files.
The binding files resides in the directory /var/yp/binding
and are conventionally named [domainname].[version]. The
supported versions are 1 and 2. There could be several such
files since it is possible for an NIS client to be bound to
more than one domain.</p>

<p>After a binding has been established, ypbind will send
YPPROC_DOMAIN requests to the current NIS server at 20
seconds intervals. If it doesn t get an response or the NIS
server reports that he doesnt have this domain any longer,
ypbind will search for a new NIS server. All 15 minutes
ypbind will check to see if the current NIS server is the
fastest. If it find a server which answers faster, it will
switch to this server. You could tell ypbind to use network
broadcasts to find a new server, what is insecure, or you
could give it a list of known secure servers. In this case
ypbind will send a ping to all servers and binds to first
one which answers.</p>

<p>Unless the option -debug is used, ypbind detaches itself
from the controlling terminal and puts itself into
background. ypbind uses syslog(3) for logging errors and
warnings. At startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP, ypbind
parses the file /etc/yp.conf and tries to use the entries
for its initial binding.</p>

<p>A broadcast entry in the configuration file will
overwrite a ypserver/server entry and a ypserver/server
entry broadcast. If all given server are down, ypbind will
not switch to use broadcast. ypbind will try at first
/etc/hosts and then DNS for resolving the hosts names from
/etc/yp.conf. If ypbind couldn t reconfigure the search
order, it will use only DNS. If DNS isnt available, you
could only use IP-addresses in /etc/hosts. ypbind could only
reconfigure the search order with glibc 2.x. If the
-broadcast option is specified, ypbind will ignore the
configuration file. If the file does not exist or if there
are no valid entries, ypbind exit.</p>

<p>This ypbind version listens for DBUS messages from
NetworkManager. If no NetworkManager is running at startup,
ypbind will behave as usual and assumes there is a working
network connection. If NetworkManager is running on the
system, ypbind will only search and providde NIS
informations, if NetworkManager tells that a network
connection is available. If NetworkManager establishes a
connection, ypbind will reread all configuration files,
registers at the local portmapper and try to search NIS
servers. If NetworkManager drops a connection, ypbind will
unregister from portmapper.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -broadcast Send a broadcast to request the
information needed to bind to a specific NIS server. With
this option, /etc/yp.conf will be ignored.</p>

<p>-ypset Allow root from any remote machine to change the
binding for a domain via the ypset(8) command. By default,
no one can change the binding. This option is really
insecure. If you change a binding for a domain, all the
current known servers for this domain will be forgotten. If
the new server goes down, ypbind will use the old
searchlist.</p>

<p>-ypsetme The same as -ypset, but only root on the local
machine is allowed to chang the binding. Such requests are
only allowd from loopback.</p>

<p>-c ypbind only checks if the config file has syntax
errors and exits.</p>

<p>-debug starts ypbind in debug mode. ypbind will not put
itself into background, and error messages and debug output
are written to standard error.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes ypbind to syslog(2) any and all changes
in the server its bound to.</p>

<p>-broken-server lets ypbind accept answers from servers
running on an illegal port number. This should usually be
avoided, but is required by some ypserv(8) versions.</p>

<p>-no-ping ypbind will not check if the binding is alive.
This option is for use with dialup connections to prevent
ypbind from keeping the connection unnessecarily open or
causing autodials.</p>

<p>-p port ypbind will bind itself to this port. This makes
it possible to have a router filter packets to the NIS
ports, so that access to this service from hosts on the
Internet can be restricted.</p>

<p>-f configfile ypbind will use configfile and not
/etc/yp.conf</p>

<p>-local-only ypbind will only bind to the loopback device
and is not reacheable from a remote network.</p>

<p>-ping-interval ping-interval The default value for
ypbind to check, if a NIS server is still reacheable, is 20
seconds. With this options another frequency in seconds can
be specified.</p>

<p>-no-dbus Disables DBUS support if compiled in.</p>

<p>--version Prints the version number</p>

<p>FILES /etc/yp.conf configuration file.</p>

<p>/var/yp/binding/[domainname].[version] binding file
containing information about each NIS domain.</p>

<p>/var/run/ypbind.pid contains the process id of the
currently running ypbind master process.</p>
