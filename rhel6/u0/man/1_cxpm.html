<p>NAME cxpm - Check an XPM (X PixMap) file - XPM 1, 2, or
3.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cxpm [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cxpm program can be used to check the
format of any XPM (version 1, 2, or 3) file. On error,
unlike sxpm, cxpm prints out an error message indicating
where the parser choked. This should help finding out whats
wrong with an XPM file but do not expect too much from it
though. This is not even close from being some kind of lint
program for XPM. First, it stops at the first error it
encounters - so several fix and retry cycles may be
necessary to get your file to parse successfully. Second,
cxpm only cares about the format. If, for instance, your
pixmap uses too many colors for your system you still may
experience difficulties displaying it. Be warned.</p>

<p>When no filename is given cxpm reads from the standard
input.</p>
