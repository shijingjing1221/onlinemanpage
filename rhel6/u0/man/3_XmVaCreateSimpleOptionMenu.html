<p>NAME XmVaCreateSimpleOptionMenu A RowColumn widget
convenience creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmVaCreateSimpleOptionMenu( Widget parent, String name,
XmString option_label, KeySym option_mnemonic, int
button_set, XtCallbackProc callback);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmVaCreateSimpleOptionMenu creates an
instance of a RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_OPTION and
returns the associated widget ID. This routine uses the ANSI
C variable-length argument list (varargs) calling conven-
tion.</p>

<p>This routine creates an OptionMenu and its Pulldown
submenu containing PushButtonGadget or CascadeButtonGadget
children. The name of each button is button_n, where n is an
integer from 0 (zero) to the number of buttons in the menu
minus 1. The name of each separator is separa- tor_n, where
n is an integer from 0 (zero) to the number of separators in
the menu minus 1. Buttons and separators are named and
created in the order in which they are specified in the
variable portion of the argument list.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget</p>

<p>option_label Specifies the label string to be used on
the left side of the OptionMenu.</p>

<p>option_mnemonic Specifies a keysym for a key that, when
pressed by the user, posts the associated Pulldown menu
pane.</p>

<p>button_set Specifies which PushButtonGadget is initially
set. The value is the integer n that corresponds to the nth
PushButtonGadget specified in the variable portion of the
argument list. Only a PushButtonGadget can be set, and only
PushButtonGadgets are counted in determining the integer n.
The first PushButton- Gadget is number 0 (zero).</p>

<p>callback Specifies a callback procedure to be called
when a button is activated. This callback function is added
to each button after creation as the button s
XmNactivateCallback. The callback function is called when a
button is activated, and the button number is returned in
the client_data field.</p>

<p>The variable portion of the argument list consists of
groups of argu- ments. The first argument in each group is a
constant or a string and determines which arguments follow
in that group. The last argument in the list must be NULL.
Following are the possible first arguments in each group of
varargs:</p>

<p>XmVaPUSHBUTTON This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the OptionMenu
s Pulldown submenu and some of its resource values. The
button created is a PushButton- Gadget. Following are the
additional four arguments, in order:</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym</p>

<p>accelerator The accelerator, of type String</p>

<p>accelerator_text The accelerator text, of type
XmString</p>

<p>XmVaSEPARATOR This is followed by no additional
arguments. It specifies one separator in the OptionMenus
Pulldown submenu.</p>

<p>XmVaDOUBLE_SEPARATOR This is followed by no additional
arguments. It specifies one separator in the OptionMenus
Pulldown submenu. The separator type is XmDOUBLE_LINE.</p>

<p>resource_name This is followed by one additional
argument, the value of the resource, of type XtArgVal. The
pair specifies a resource and its value for the Pulldown
submenu.</p>

<p>XtVaTypedArg This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies a resource and its value for
the Pulldown submenu. A resource type conversion is
performed if necessary. Following are the additional four
arguments, in order:</p>

<p>name The resource name, of type String</p>

<p>type The type of the resource value supplied, of type
String</p>

<p>value The resource value (or a pointer to the resource
value, depending on the type and size of the value), of type
XtArgVal</p>

<p>size The size of the resource value in bytes, of type
int</p>

<p>XtVaNestedList This is followed by one additional
argument of type XtVarArgsList. This argument is a nested
list of varargs returned by XtVaCreateArgsList.</p>

<p>The user can specify resources in a resource file for
the automatically created widgets and gadgets of an
OptionMenu. The following list iden- tifies the names of
these widgets (or gadgets) and the associated OptionMenu
areas:</p>

<p>Option Menu Label Gadget OptionLabel</p>

<p>Option Menu Cascade Button OptionButton</p>

<p>For more information on variable-length argument lists,
see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.</p>

<p>A number of resources exist specifically for use with
this and other simple menu creation routines. For a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>

XmCreateSimpleOption- Menu(3), and XmRowColumn(3).</p>
