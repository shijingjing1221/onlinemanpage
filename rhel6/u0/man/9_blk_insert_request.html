<p>BLK_INSERT_REQUEST(9) Block Devices
BLK_INSERT_REQUEST(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_insert_request - insert a special request into
a request queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void blk_insert_request(struct request_queue *
q, struct request * rq, int at_head, void * data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q request queue where request should be
inserted</p>

<p>rq request to be inserted</p>

<p>at_head insert request at head or tail of queue</p>

<p>data private data</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Many block devices need to execute commands
asynchronously, so they don&acute;t block the whole kernel
from preemption during request execution. This is
accomplished normally by inserting aritficial requests
tagged as REQ_TYPE_SPECIAL in to the corresponding request
queue, and letting them be scheduled for actual execution by
the request queue.</p>

<p>We have the option of inserting the head or the tail of
the queue. Typically we use the tail for new ioctls and so
forth. We use the head of the queue for things like a
QUEUE_FULL message from a device, or a host that is unable
to accept a particular command.</p>
