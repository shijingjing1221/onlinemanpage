<p>bzr(1) Bazaar bzr(1)</p>

<p>NAME bzr - Bazaar next-generation distributed version
control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bzr command [ command_options ] bzr help bzr
help command</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Bazaar (or bzr) is a project of Canonical to
develop an open source distributed version control system
that is powerful, friendly, and scalable. Version control
means a system that keeps track of previous revisions of
software source code or similar information and helps peo-
ple work on it in teams.</p>

<p>bzr -? Alias for &quot;help&quot;, see &quot;bzr
help&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr -h Alias for &quot;help&quot;, see &quot;bzr
help&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr ? Alias for &quot;help&quot;, see &quot;bzr
help&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr add [FILE...] Options: --dry-run Show what would be
done, but don&acute;t actually do anything. --file-ids-from
ARG Lookup file ids from this tree. --help, -h Show help
message. --no-recurse Don&acute;t recursively add the
contents of directories. --quiet, -q Only display errors and
warnings. --usage Show usage message and options. --verbose,
-v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: ignore, remove</p>

<p>Add specified files or directories.</p>

<p>In non-recursive mode, all the named items are added,
regardless of whether they were previously ignored. A
warning is given if any of the named files are already
versioned.</p>

<p>In recursive mode (the default), files are treated the
same way but the behaviour for directories is different.
Directories that are already versioned do not give a
warning. All directories, whether already ver- sioned or
not, are searched for files or subdirectories that are nei-
ther versioned or ignored, and these are added. This search
proceeds recursively into versioned directories. If no names
are given &acute;.&acute; is assumed.</p>

<p>Therefore simply saying &acute;bzr add&acute; will
version all files that are cur- rently unknown.</p>

<p>Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned
will implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root.
This means you should never need to explicitly add a
directory, they&acute;ll just get added when you add a file
in the directory.</p>

<p>--dry-run will show which files would be added, but not
actually add them.</p>

<p>--file-ids-from will try to use the file ids from the
supplied path. It looks up ids trying to find a matching
parent directory with the same filename, and then by pure
path. This option is rarely needed but can be useful when
adding the same logical file into two branches that will be
merged later (without showing the two different adds as a
con- flict). It is also useful when merging another project
into a subdirec- tory of this one.</p>

<p>Any files matching patterns in the ignore list will not
be added unless they are explicitly mentioned.</p>

<p>bzr alias [NAME] Options: --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --remove
Remove the alias. --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Set/unset and display aliases.</p>

<p>Examples: Show the current aliases:</p>

<p>bzr alias</p>

<p>Show the alias specified for &acute;ll&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr alias ll</p>

<p>Set an alias for &acute;ll&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr alias ll=&quot;log --line -r-10..-1&quot;</p>

<p>To remove an alias for &acute;ll&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr alias --remove ll</p>

<p>bzr ann Alias for &quot;annotate&quot;, see &quot;bzr
annotate&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr annotate FILENAME Options: --all Show annotations on
all lines. --help, -h Show help message. --long Show commit
date in annotations. --quiet, -q Only display errors and
warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --show-ids Show internal
object ids. --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Aliases: ann, blame, praise</p>

<p>Show the origin of each line in a file.</p>

<p>This prints out the given file with an annotation on the
left side indicating which revision, author and date
introduced the change.</p>

<p>If the origin is the same for a run of consecutive
lines, it is shown only at the top, unless the --all option
is given.</p>

<p>bzr bind [LOCATION] Options: --help, -h Show help
message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: checkouts, unbind</p>

<p>Convert the current branch into a checkout of the
supplied branch.</p>

<p>Once converted into a checkout, commits must succeed on
the master branch before they will be applied to the local
branch.</p>

<p>Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch
unless it is set locally, in which case binding will update
the local nickname to be that of the master.</p>

<p>bzr blame Alias for &quot;annotate&quot;, see &quot;bzr
annotate&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr branch FROM_LOCATION [TO_LOCATION] Options: --bind
Bind new branch to from location. --hardlink Hard-link
working tree files where possible. --help, -h Show help
message. --no-tree Create a branch without a working-tree.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --revision
ARG, -r See &quot;help revisionspec&quot; for details.
--stacked Create a stacked branch referring to the source
branch. The new branch will depend on the availability of
the source branch for all operations. --standalone Do not
use a shared repository, even if available. --switch Switch
the checkout in the current directory to the new branch.
--usage Show usage message and options. --use-existing-dir
By default branch will fail if the target directory exists,
but does not already have a control directory. This flag
will allow branch to proceed. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>Aliases: get, clone</p>

<p>See also: checkout</p>

<p>Create a new branch that is a copy of an existing
branch.</p>

<p>If the TO_LOCATION is omitted, the last component of the
FROM_LOCATION will be used. In other words, &quot;branch
../foo/bar&quot; will attempt to cre- ate ./bar. If the
FROM_LOCATION has no / or path separator embedded, the
TO_LOCATION is derived from the FROM_LOCATION by stripping a
lead- ing scheme or drive identifier, if any. For example,
&quot;branch lp:foo-bar&quot; will attempt to create
./foo-bar.</p>

<p>To retrieve the branch as of a particular revision,
supply the --revi- sion parameter, as in &quot;branch
foo/bar -r 5&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr break-lock [LOCATION] Options: --help, -h Show help
message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>Break a dead lock on a repository, branch or working
directory.</p>

<p>CAUTION: Locks should only be broken when you are sure
that the process holding the lock has been stopped.</p>

<p>You can get information on what locks are open via the
&acute;bzr info [loca- tion]&acute; command.</p>

<p>Examples: bzr break-lock bzr break-lock
bzr+ssh://example.com/bzr/foo</p>

<p>bzr cat FILENAME Options: --filters Apply content
filters to display the convenience form. --help, -h Show
help message. --name-from-revision The path name in the old
tree. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--revision ARG, -r See &quot;help revisionspec&quot; for
details. --usage Show usage message and options. --verbose,
-v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: ls</p>

<p>Write the contents of a file as of a given revision to
standard output.</p>

<p>If no revision is nominated, the last revision is
used.</p>

<p>Note: Take care to redirect standard output when using
this command on a binary file.</p>

<p>bzr check [PATH] Options: --branch Check the branch
related to the current directory. --help, -h Show help
message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--repo Check the repository related to the current
directory. --tree Check the working tree related to the
current directory. --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: reconcile</p>

<p>Validate working tree structure, branch consistency and
repository his- tory.</p>

<p>This command checks various invariants about branch and
repository storage to detect data corruption or bzr
bugs.</p>

<p>The working tree and branch checks will only give output
if a problem is detected. The output fields of the
repository check are:</p>

<p>revisions This is just the number of revisions checked.
It doesn&acute;t indicate a problem.</p>

<p>versionedfiles This is just the number of versionedfiles
checked. It doesn&acute;t indicate a problem.</p>

<p>unreferenced ancestors Texts that are ancestors of other
texts, but are not properly referenced by the revision
ancestry. This is a subtle problem that Bazaar can work
around.</p>

<p>unique file texts This is the total number of unique
file contents seen in the checked revisions. It does not
indicate a problem.</p>

<p>repeated file texts This is the total number of repeated
texts seen in the checked revisions. Texts can be repeated
when their file entries are modified, but the file contents
are not. It does not indicate a problem.</p>

<p>If no restrictions are specified, all Bazaar data that
is found at the given location will be checked.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Check the tree and branch at &acute;foo&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr check --tree --branch foo</p>

<p>Check only the repository at &acute;bar&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr check --repo bar</p>

<p>Check everything at &acute;baz&acute;:</p>

<p>bzr check baz</p>

<p>bzr checkin Alias for &quot;commit&quot;, see &quot;bzr
commit&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr checkout [BRANCH_LOCATION] [TO_LOCATION] Options:
--files-from ARG Get file contents from this tree.
--hardlink Hard-link working tree files where possible.
--help, -h Show help message. --lightweight Perform a
lightweight checkout. Lightweight checkouts depend on access
to the branch for every operation. Normal checkouts can
perform common operations like diff and status without such
access, and also support local commits. --quiet, -q Only
display errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See
&quot;help revisionspec&quot; for details. --usage Show
usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>Alias: co</p>

<p>See also: branch, checkouts</p>

<p>Create a new checkout of an existing branch.</p>

<p>If BRANCH_LOCATION is omitted, checkout will
reconstitute a working tree for the branch found in
&acute;.&acute;. This is useful if you have removed the
working tree or if it was never created - i.e. if you pushed
the branch to its current location using SFTP.</p>

<p>If the TO_LOCATION is omitted, the last component of the
BRANCH_LOCA- TION will be used. In other words,
&quot;checkout ../foo/bar&quot; will attempt to create
./bar. If the BRANCH_LOCATION has no / or path separator
embedded, the TO_LOCATION is derived from the
BRANCH_LOCATION by strip- ping a leading scheme or drive
identifier, if any. For example, &quot;check- out
lp:foo-bar&quot; will attempt to create ./foo-bar.</p>

<p>To retrieve the branch as of a particular revision,
supply the --revi- sion parameter, as in &quot;checkout
foo/bar -r 5&quot;. Note that this will be immediately out
of date [so you cannot commit] but it may be useful (i.e. to
examine old code.)</p>

<p>bzr ci Alias for &quot;commit&quot;, see &quot;bzr
commit&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr clean-tree Options: --detritus Delete conflict
files, merge backups, and failed selftest dirs. --dry-run
Show files to delete instead of deleting them. --force Do
not prompt before deleting. --help, -h Show help message.
--ignored Delete all ignored files. --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --unknown Delete files unknown to bzr
(default). --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Remove unwanted files from working tree.</p>

<p>By default, only unknown files, not ignored files, are
deleted. Ver- sioned files are never deleted.</p>

<p>Another class is &acute;detritus&acute;, which includes
files emitted by bzr during normal operations and selftests.
(The value of these files decreases with time.)</p>

<p>If no options are specified, unknown files are deleted.
Otherwise, option flags are respected, and may be
combined.</p>

<p>To check what clean-tree will do, use --dry-run.</p>

<p>bzr clone Alias for &quot;branch&quot;, see &quot;bzr
branch&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr co Alias for &quot;checkout&quot;, see &quot;bzr
checkout&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr commit [SELECTED...] Options: --author ARG Set the
author&acute;s name, if it&acute;s different from the
committer. --commit-time ARG Manually set a commit time
using commit date format, e.g. &acute;2009-10-10 08:00:00
+0100&acute;. --exclude ARG, -x Do not consider changes made
to a given path. --file MSGFILE, -F Take commit message from
this file. --fixes ARG Mark a bug as being fixed by this
revision (see &quot;bzr help bugs&quot;). --help, -h Show
help message. --local Perform a local commit in a bound
branch. Local commits are not pushed to the master branch
until a normal commit is performed. --message ARG, -m
Description of the new revision. --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --show-diff When no message is
supplied, show the diff along with the status summary in the
message editor. --strict Refuse to commit if there are
unknown files in the working tree. --unchanged Commit even
if nothing has changed. --usage Show usage message and
options. --verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Aliases: ci, checkin</p>

<p>See also: add, bugs, hooks, uncommit</p>

<p>Commit changes into a new revision.</p>

<p>An explanatory message needs to be given for each
commit. This is often done by using the --message option
(getting the message from the com- mand line) or by using
the --file option (getting the message from a file). If
neither of these options is given, an editor is opened for
the user to enter the message. To see the changed files in
the boiler- plate text loaded into the editor, use the
--show-diff option.</p>

<p>By default, the entire tree is committed and the person
doing the com- mit is assumed to be the author. These
defaults can be overridden as explained below.</p>

<p>Selective commits:</p>

<p>If selected files are specified, only changes to those
files are committed. If a directory is specified then the
directory and everything within it is committed.</p>

<p>When excludes are given, they take precedence over
selected files. For example, to commit only changes within
foo, but not changes within foo/bar:</p>

<p>bzr commit foo -x foo/bar</p>

<p>A selective commit after a merge is not yet
supported.</p>

<p>Custom authors:</p>

<p>If the author of the change is not the same person as
the committer, you can specify the author&acute;s name using
the --author option. The name should be in the same format
as a committer-id, e.g. &quot;John Doe
&lt;jdoe@example.com&gt;&quot;. If there is more than one
author of the change you can specify the option multiple
times, once for each author.</p>

<p>Checks:</p>

<p>A common mistake is to forget to add a new file or
directory before running the commit command. The --strict
option checks for unknown files and aborts the commit if any
are found. More advanced pre-com- mit checks can be
implemented by defining hooks. See &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help
hooks&lsquo;&lsquo; for details.</p>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<p>If you accidentially commit the wrong changes or make a
spelling mistake in the commit message say, you can use the
uncommit command to undo it. See &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help
uncommit&lsquo;&lsquo; for details.</p>

<p>Hooks can also be configured to run after a commit. This
allows you to trigger updates to external systems like bug
trackers. The --fixes option can be used to record the
association between a revision and one or more bugs. See
&lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help bugs&lsquo;&lsquo; for details.</p>

<p>A selective commit may fail in some cases where the
committed tree would be invalid. Consider:</p>

<p>bzr init foo mkdir foo/bar bzr add foo/bar bzr commit
foo -m &quot;committing foo&quot; bzr mv foo/bar foo/baz
mkdir foo/bar bzr add foo/bar bzr commit foo/bar -m
&quot;committing bar but not baz&quot;</p>

<p>In the example above, the last commit will fail by
design. This gives the user the opportunity to decide
whether they want to commit the rename at the same time,
separately first, or not at all. (As a gen- eral rule, when
in doubt, Bazaar has a policy of Doing the Safe Thing.)</p>

<p>bzr conflicts Options: --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --text List
paths of files with text conflicts. --usage Show usage
message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>See also: conflict-types, resolve</p>

<p>List files with conflicts.</p>

<p>Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two
branches, but there are some kinds of problems only a human
can fix. When it encoun- ters those, it will mark a
conflict. A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you should commit.</p>

<p>Conflicts normally are listed as short, human-readable
messages. If --text is supplied, the pathnames of files with
text conflicts are listed, instead. (This is useful for
editing all files with text con- flicts.)</p>

<p>Use bzr resolve when you have fixed a problem.</p>

<p>bzr del Alias for &quot;remove&quot;, see &quot;bzr
remove&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr deleted Options: --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --show-ids
Show internal object ids. --usage Show usage message and
options. --verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: ls, status</p>

<p>List files deleted in the working tree.</p>

<p>bzr di Alias for &quot;diff&quot;, see &quot;bzr
diff&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr dif Alias for &quot;diff&quot;, see &quot;bzr
diff&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr diff [FILE...] Options: --change ARG, -c Select
changes introduced by the specified revision. See also
&quot;help revisionspec&quot;. --diff-options ARG Pass these
options to the external diff program. --help, -h Show help
message. --new ARG Branch/tree to compare to. --old ARG
Branch/tree to compare from. --prefix ARG, -p Set prefixes
added to old and new filenames, as two values separated by a
colon. (eg &quot;old/:new/&quot;). --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --usage Show usage message
and options. --using ARG Use this command to compare files.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Aliases: di, dif</p>

<p>See also: status</p>

<p>Show differences in the working tree, between revisions
or branches.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given, all changes for the current
tree are listed. If files are given, only the changes in
those files are listed. Remote and multiple branches can be
compared by using the --old and --new options. If not
provided, the default for both is derived from the first
argument, if any, or the current tree if no arguments are
given.</p>

<p>&quot;bzr diff -p1&quot; is equivalent to &quot;bzr diff
--prefix old/:new/&quot;, and pro- duces patches suitable
for &quot;patch -p1&quot;.</p>

<p>Exit values: 1 - changed 2 - unrepresentable changes 3 -
error 0 - no change</p>

<p>Examples: Shows the difference in the working tree
versus the last commit:</p>

<p>bzr diff</p>

<p>Difference between the working tree and revision 1:</p>

<p>bzr diff -r1</p>

<p>Difference between revision 3 and revision 1:</p>

<p>bzr diff -r1..3</p>

<p>Difference between revision 3 and revision 1 for branch
xxx:</p>

<p>bzr diff -r1..3 xxx</p>

<p>To see the changes introduced in revision X:</p>

<p>bzr diff -cX</p>

<p>Note that in the case of a merge, the -c option shows
the changes compared to the left hand parent. To see the
changes against another parent, use:</p>

<p>bzr diff -r&lt;chosen_parent&gt;..X</p>

<p>The changes introduced by revision 2 (equivalent to
-r1..2):</p>

<p>bzr diff -c2</p>

<p>Show just the differences for file NEWS:</p>

<p>bzr diff NEWS</p>

<p>Show the differences in working tree xxx for file
NEWS:</p>

<p>bzr diff xxx/NEWS</p>

<p>Show the differences from branch xxx to this working
tree:</p>

<p>bzr diff --old xxx</p>

<p>Show the differences between two branches for file
NEWS:</p>

<p>bzr diff --old xxx --new yyy NEWS</p>

<p>Same as &acute;bzr diff&acute; but prefix paths with
old/ and new/:</p>

<p>bzr diff --prefix old/:new/</p>

<p>bzr export DEST [BRANCH_OR_SUBDIR] Options: --filters
Apply content filters to export the convenient form.
--format ARG Type of file to export to. --help, -h Show help
message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--revision ARG, -r See &quot;help revisionspec&quot; for
details. --root ARG Name of the root directory inside the
exported file. --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Export current or past revision to a destination
directory or archive.</p>

<p>If no revision is specified this exports the last
committed revision.</p>

<p>Format may be an &quot;exporter&quot; name, such as tar,
tgz, tbz2. If none is given, try to find the format with the
extension. If no extension is found exports to a directory
(equivalent to --format=dir).</p>

<p>If root is supplied, it will be used as the root
directory inside con- tainer formats (tar, zip, etc). If it
is not supplied it will default to the exported filename.
The root option has no effect for &acute;dir&acute; for-
mat.</p>

<p>Ignore specified files or patterns.</p>

<p>See &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help patterns&lsquo;&lsquo; for
details on the syntax of patterns.</p>

<p>If a .bzrignore file does not exist, the ignore command
will create one and add the specified files or patterns to
the newly created file. The ignore command will also
automatically add the the use of the ignore command will
require an explicit add command.</p>

<p>To remove patterns from the ignore list, edit the

either indirectly by using this command or directly by using
an editor, be sure to commit it.</p>

<p>Patterns prefixed with &acute;!&acute; are exceptions to
ignore patterns and take precedence over regular ignores.
Such exceptions are used to specify files that should be
versioned which would otherwise be ignored.</p>

<p>Patterns prefixed with &acute;!!&acute; act as regular
ignore patterns, but have precedence over the

<p>Alias: init-repo</p>

<p>See also: branch, checkout, init, repositories</p>

<p>Create a shared repository for branches to share storage
space.</p>

<p>New branches created under the repository directory will
store their revisions in the repository, not in the branch
directory. For branches with shared history, this reduces
the amount of storage needed and speeds up the creation of
new branches.</p>

<p>If the --no-trees option is given then the branches in
the repository will not have working trees by default. They
will still exist as directories on disk, but they will not
have separate copies of the files at a certain revision.
This can be useful for repositories that store branches
which are interacted with through checkouts or remote
branches, such as on a server.</p>

<p>Examples: Create a shared repository holding just
branches:</p>

<p>bzr init-repo --no-trees repo bzr init repo/trunk</p>

<p>Make a lightweight checkout elsewhere:</p>

<p>bzr checkout --lightweight repo/trunk trunk-checkout cd
trunk-checkout (add files here)</p>

<p>See also: split</p>

<p>Combine a tree into its containing tree.</p>

<p>This command requires the target tree to be in a
rich-root format.</p>

<p>The TREE argument should be an independent tree, inside
another tree, but not part of it. (Such trees can be
produced by &quot;bzr split&quot;, but also by running
&quot;bzr branch&quot; with the target inside a tree.)</p>

<p>The result is a combined tree, with the subtree no
longer an indepen- dant part. This is marked as a merge of
the subtree into the contain- ing tree, and all history is
preserved.</p>

<p>bzr log [FILE...] Options: --change ARG, -c Show just
the specified revision. See also &quot;help
revisionspec&quot;. --forward Show from oldest to newest.
--help, -h Show help message. --include-merges Show merged
revisions like --levels 0 does. --levels N, -n Number of
levels to display - 0 for all, 1 for flat. --limit N, -l
Limit the output to the first N revisions. --log-format ARG
Use specified log format. --gnu-changelog Format used by GNU
ChangeLog files --line Log format with one line per revision
--long Detailed log format --short Moderately short log
format --message ARG, -m Show revisions whose message
matches this regular expression. --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --show-diff, -p Show changes
made in each revision as a patch. --show-ids Show internal
object ids. --timezone ARG Display timezone as local,
original, or utc. --usage Show usage message and options.
--verbose, -v Show files changed in each revision.</p>

<p>See also: log-formats, revisionspec</p>

<p>Show historical log for a branch or subset of a
branch.</p>

<p>log is bzr&acute;s default tool for exploring the
history of a branch. The branch to use is taken from the
first parameter. If no parameters are given, the branch
containing the working directory is logged. Here are some
simple examples:</p>

<p>bzr log log the current branch bzr log foo.py log a file
in its branch bzr log http://server/branch log a branch on a
server</p>

<p>The filtering, ordering and information shown for each
revision can be controlled as explained below. By default,
all revisions are shown sorted (topologically) so that newer
revisions appear before older ones and descendants always
appear before ancestors. If displayed, merged revisions are
shown indented under the revision in which they were
merged.</p>

<p>Output control:</p>

<p>The log format controls how information about each
revision is displayed. The standard log formats are called
&lsquo;&lsquo;long&lsquo;&lsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;short&lsquo;&lsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;line&lsquo;&lsquo;. The default is long. See
&lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help log-formats&lsquo;&lsquo; for more
details on log formats.</p>

<p>The following options can be used to control what
information is displayed:</p>

<p>-l N display a maximum of N revisions -n N display N
levels of revisions (0 for all, 1 for col- lapsed) -v
display a status summary (delta) for each revision -p
display a diff (patch) for each revision --show-ids display
revision-ids (and file-ids), not just revnos</p>

<p>Note that the default number of levels to display is a
function of the log format. If the -n option is not used,
the standard log formats show just the top level
(mainline).</p>

<p>Status summaries are shown using status flags like A, M,
etc. To see the changes explained using words like
&lsquo;&lsquo;added&lsquo;&lsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;modified&lsquo;&lsquo; instead, use the -vv
option.</p>

<p>Ordering control:</p>

<p>To display revisions from oldest to newest, use the
--forward option. In most cases, using this option will have
little impact on the total time taken to produce a log,
though --forward does not incrementally display revisions
like --reverse does when it can.</p>

<p>Revision filtering:</p>

<p>The -r option can be used to specify what revision or
range of revi- sions to filter against. The various forms
are shown below:</p>

<p>-rX display revision X -rX.. display revision X and
later -r..Y display up to and including revision Y -rX..Y
display from X to Y inclusive</p>

<p>See &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr help revisionspec&lsquo;&lsquo;
for details on how to specify X and Y. Some common examples
are given below:</p>

<p>-r-1 show just the tip -r-10.. show the last 10 mainline
revisions -rsubmit:.. show what&acute;s new on this branch
-rancestor:path.. show changes since the common ancestor of
this branch and the one at location path -rdate:yesterday..
show changes since yesterday</p>

<p>When logging a range of revisions using -rX..Y, log
starts at revision Y and searches back in history through
the primary (&quot;left-hand&quot;) parents until it finds
X. When logging just the top level (using -n1), an error is
reported if X is not found along the way. If multi-level
logging is used (-n0), X may be a nested merge revision and
the log will be truncated accordingly.</p>

<p>Path filtering:</p>

<p>If parameters are given and the first one is not a
branch, the log will be filtered to show only those
revisions that changed the nominated files or
directories.</p>

<p>Filenames are interpreted within their historical
context. To log a deleted file, specify a revision range so
that the file existed at the end or start of the range.</p>

<p>Historical context is also important when interpreting
pathnames of renamed files/directories. Consider the
following example:</p>

<p>* revision 1: add tutorial.txt * revision 2: modify
tutorial.txt * revision 3: rename tutorial.txt to guide.txt;
add tutorial.txt</p>

<p>In this case:</p>

<p>* &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log guide.txt&lsquo;&lsquo; will log
the file added in revision 1</p>

<p>* &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log tutorial.txt&lsquo;&lsquo; will
log the new file added in revision 3</p>

<p>* &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log -r2 -p
tutorial.txt&lsquo;&lsquo; will show the changes made to the
original file in revision 2.</p>

<p>* &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log -r2 -p guide.txt&lsquo;&lsquo;
will display an error message as there was no file called
guide.txt in revision 2.</p>

<p>Renames are always followed by log. By design, there is
no need to explicitly ask for this (and no way to stop
logging a file back until it was last renamed).</p>

<p>Other filtering:</p>

<p>The --message option can be used for finding revisions
that match a regular expression in a commit message.</p>

<p>Tips &amp; tricks:</p>

<p>GUI tools and IDEs are often better at exploring history
than command line tools. You may prefer qlog or glog from
the QBzr and Bzr-Gtk packages respectively for example.
(TortoiseBzr uses qlog for displaying logs.) See
http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrPlugins and
http://bazaar-vcs.org/IDEInte- gration.</p>

<p>Web interfaces are often better at exploring history
than command line tools, particularly for branches on
servers. You may prefer Logger- head or one of its
alternatives. See http://bazaar-vcs.org/WebInterface.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to add the aliases below to
&lsquo;&lsquo;bazaar.conf&lsquo;&lsquo;:</p>

<p>[ALIASES] tip = log -r-1 top = log -l10 --line show =
log -v -p</p>

<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;bzr tip&lsquo;&lsquo; will then show the
latest revision while &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr top&lsquo;&lsquo;
will show the last 10 mainline revisions. To see the details
of a particular revision X, &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr show
-rX&lsquo;&lsquo;.</p>

<p>If you are interested in looking deeper into a
particular merge X, use &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log -n0
-rX&lsquo;&lsquo;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;bzr log -v&lsquo;&lsquo; on a branch with
lots of history is currently very slow. A fix for this issue
is currently under development. With or without that fix, it
is recommended that a revision range be given when using the
-v option.</p>

<p>bzr has a generic full-text matching plugin, bzr-search,
that can be used to find revisions matching user names,
commit messages, etc. Among other features, this plugin can
find all revisions containing a list of words but not
others.</p>

<p>When exploring non-mainline history on large projects
with deep history, the performance of log can be greatly
improved by installing the historycache plugin. This plugin
buffers historical information trading disk space for faster
speed.</p>

to the root of the branch. --help, -h Show help message.

<p>bzr merge [LOCATION] Options: --change ARG, -c Select
changes introduced by the specified revision. See also
&quot;help revisionspec&quot;. --directory ARG, -d Branch to

directory. --force Merge even if the destination tree has
uncommitted changes. --help, -h Show help message.
--interactive, -i Select changes interactively. --merge-type

external diff3 --lca LCA-newness merge --merge3 Native
diff3-style merge --weave Weave-based merge --preview
Instead of merging, show a diff of the merge. --pull If the
destination is already completely merged into the source,
pull from the source rather than merging. When this happens,
you do not need to commit the result. --quiet, -q Only
display errors and warnings. --remember Remember the
specified location as a default. --reprocess Reprocess to
reduce spurious conflicts. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --show-base Show base
revision text in conflicts. --uncommitted Apply uncommitted
changes from a working copy, instead of branch changes.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: remerge, send, status-flags, update</p>

<p>Perform a three-way merge.</p>

<p>The source of the merge can be specified either in the
form of a branch, or in the form of a path to a file
containing a merge directive generated with bzr send. If
neither is specified, the default is the upstream branch or
the branch most recently merged using --remember.</p>

<p>When merging a branch, by default the tip will be
merged. To pick a different revision, pass --revision. If
you specify two values, the first will be used as BASE and
the second one as OTHER. Merging indi- vidual revisions, or
a subset of available revisions, like this is com- monly
referred to as &quot;cherrypicking&quot;.</p>

<p>Revision numbers are always relative to the branch being
merged.</p>

<p>By default, bzr will try to merge in all new work from
the other branch, automatically determining an appropriate
base. If this fails, you may need to give an explicit
base.</p>

<p>Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two
branches, but there are some kinds of problems only a human
can fix. When it encoun- ters those, it will mark a
conflict. A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you should commit.</p>

<p>Use bzr resolve when you have fixed a problem. See also
bzr conflicts.</p>

<p>If there is no default branch set, the first merge will
set it. After that, you can omit the branch to use the
default. To change the default, use --remember. The value
will only be saved if the remote location can be
accessed.</p>

<p>The results of the merge are placed into the destination
working direc- tory, where they can be reviewed (with bzr
diff), tested, and then com- mitted to record the result of
the merge.</p>

<p>merge refuses to run if there are any uncommitted
changes, unless --force is given. The --force option can
also be used to create a merge revision which has more than
two parents.</p>

<p>If one would like to merge changes from the working tree
of the other branch without merging any committed revisions,
the --uncommitted option can be given.</p>

<p>To select only some changes to merge, use &quot;merge
-i&quot;, which will prompt you to apply each diff hunk and
file change, similar to &quot;shelve&quot;.</p>

<p>Examples: To merge the latest revision from bzr.dev:</p>

<p>bzr merge ../bzr.dev</p>

<p>To merge changes up to and including revision 82 from
bzr.dev:</p>

<p>bzr merge -r 82 ../bzr.dev</p>

<p>To merge the changes introduced by 82, without previous
changes:</p>

<p>bzr merge -r 81..82 ../bzr.dev</p>

<p>To apply a merge directive contained in /tmp/merge:</p>

<p>bzr merge /tmp/merge</p>

<p>To create a merge revision with three parents from two
branches feature1a and feature1b:</p>

<p>bzr merge ../feature1a bzr merge ../feature1b --force
bzr commit -m &acute;revision with three parents&acute;</p>

<p>Usage: bzr mv OLDNAME NEWNAME</p>

<p>bzr mv SOURCE... DESTINATION</p>

<p>If the last argument is a versioned directory, all the
other names are moved into it. Otherwise, there must be
exactly two arguments and the file is changed to a new
name.</p>

<p>If OLDNAME does not exist on the filesystem but is
versioned and NEW- NAME does exist on the filesystem but is
not versioned, mv assumes that the file has been manually
moved and only updates its internal inven- tory to reflect
that change. The same is valid when moving many SOURCE files
to a DESTINATION.</p>

<p>See also: push, send, status-flags, update</p>

<p>Turn this branch into a mirror of another branch.</p>

<p>By default, this command only works on branches that
have not diverged. Branches are considered diverged if the
destination branch&acute;s most recent commit is one that
has not been merged (directly or indirectly) into the
parent.</p>

<p>If branches have diverged, you can use &acute;bzr
merge&acute; to integrate the changes from one into the
other. Once one branch has merged, the other should be able
to pull it again.</p>

<p>If you want to replace your local changes and just want
your branch to match the remote one, use pull --overwrite.
This will work even if the two branches have diverged.</p>

<p>If there is no default location set, the first pull will
set it. After that, you can omit the location to use the
default. To change the default, use --remember. The value
will only be saved if the remote location can be
accessed.</p>

<p>Note: The location can be specified either in the form
of a branch, or in the form of a path to a file containing a
merge directive generated with bzr send.</p>

<p>bzr push [LOCATION] Options: --create-prefix Create the
path leading up to the branch if it does not already exist.
--directory ARG, -d Branch to push from, rather than the one
containing the working directory. --help, -h Show help
message. --overwrite Ignore differences between branches and
overwrite unconditionally. --quiet, -q Only display errors
and warnings. --remember Remember the specified location as
a default. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --stacked Create a stacked
branch that references the public location of the parent
branch. --stacked-on ARG Create a stacked branch that refers
to another branch for the commit history. Only the work not
present in the referenced branch is included in the branch
created. --strict Refuse to push if there are uncommitted
changes in the working tree, --no-strict disables the check.
--usage Show usage message and options. --use-existing-dir
By default push will fail if the target directory exists,
but does not already have a control directory. This flag
will allow push to proceed. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>See also: pull, update, working-trees</p>

<p>Update a mirror of this branch.</p>

<p>The target branch will not have its working tree
populated because this is both expensive, and is not
supported on remote file systems.</p>

<p>Some smart servers or protocols *may* put the working
tree in place in the future.</p>

<p>This command only works on branches that have not
diverged. Branches are considered diverged if the
destination branch&acute;s most recent commit is one that
has not been merged (directly or indirectly) by the source
branch.</p>

<p>If branches have diverged, you can use &acute;bzr push
--overwrite&acute; to replace the other branch completely,
discarding its unmerged changes.</p>

<p>If you want to ensure you have the different changes in
the other branch, do a merge (see bzr help merge) from the
other branch, and com- mit that. After that you will be able
to do a push without &acute;--over- write&acute;.</p>

<p>If there is no default push location set, the first push
will set it. After that, you can omit the location to use
the default. To change the default, use --remember. The
value will only be saved if the remote location can be
accessed.</p>

<p>bzr reconcile [BRANCH] Options: --help, -h Show help
message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: check</p>

<p>Reconcile bzr metadata in a branch.</p>

<p>This can correct data mismatches that may have been
caused by previous ghost operations or bzr upgrades. You
should only need to run this com- mand if &acute;bzr
check&acute; or a bzr developer advises you to run it.</p>

<p>If a second branch is provided, cross-branch
reconciliation is also attempted, which will check that data
like the tree root id which was not present in very early
bzr versions is represented correctly in both branches.</p>

<p>At the same time it is run it may recompress data
resulting in a poten- tial saving in disk space or
performance gain.</p>

<p>The branch *MUST* be on a listable system such as local
disk or sftp.</p>

<p>bzr reconfigure [LOCATION] Options: --bind-to ARG Branch
to bind checkout to. --force Perform reconfiguration even if
local changes will be lost. --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --stacked-on
ARG Reconfigure a branch to be stacked on another branch.
--target_type ARG The type to reconfigure the directory to.
--branch Reconfigure to be an unbound branch with no working
tree. --checkout Reconfigure to be a bound branch with a
working tree. --lightweight-checkout Reconfigure to be a
lightweight checkout (with no local history). --standalone
Reconfigure to be a standalone branch (i.e. stop using
shared repository). --tree Reconfigure to be an unbound
branch with a working tree. --use-shared Reconfigure to use
a shared repository. --with-no-trees Reconfigure repository
to not create working trees on branches by default.
--with-trees Reconfigure repository to create working trees
on branches by default. --unstacked Reconfigure a branch to
be unstacked. This may require copying substantial data into
it. --usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: branches, checkouts, standalone-trees,
working-trees</p>

<p>Reconfigure the type of a bzr directory.</p>

<p>A target configuration must be specified.</p>

<p>For checkouts, the bind-to location will be
auto-detected if not speci- fied. The order of preference is
1. For a lightweight checkout, the current bound location.
2. For branches that used to be checkouts, the
previously-bound location. 3. The push location. 4. The
parent loca- tion. If none of these is available, --bind-to
must be specified.</p>

<p>bzr remerge [FILE...] Options: --help, -h Show help
message. --merge-type ARG Select a particular merge
algorithm. --diff3 Merge using external diff3 --lca
LCA-newness merge --merge3 Native diff3-style merge --weave
Weave-based merge --quiet, -q Only display errors and
warnings. --reprocess Reprocess to reduce spurious
conflicts. --show-base Show base revision text in conflicts.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>Redo a merge.</p>

<p>Use this if you want to try a different merge technique
while resolving conflicts. Some merge techniques are better
than others, and remerge lets you try different ones on
different files.</p>

<p>The options for remerge have the same meaning and
defaults as the ones for merge. The difference is that
remerge can (only) be run when there is a pending merge, and
it lets you specify particular files.</p>

<p>Examples: Re-do the merge of all conflicted files, and
show the base text in conflict regions, in addition to the
usual THIS and OTHER texts:</p>

<p>bzr remerge --show-base</p>

<p>Re-do the merge of &quot;foobar&quot;, using the weave
merge algorithm, with additional processing to reduce the
size of conflict regions:</p>

<p>bzr remerge --merge-type weave --reprocess foobar</p>

<p>bzr remove [FILE...] Options: --file-deletion-strategy
ARGThe file deletion mode to be used. --force Delete all the
specified files, even if they can not be recovered and even
if they are non-empty directories. --keep Delete from bzr
but leave the working copy. --safe Only delete files if they
can be safely recovered (default). --help, -h Show help
message. --new Only remove files that have never been
committed. --quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>Aliases: rm, del</p>

<p>Remove files or directories.</p>

<p>This makes bzr stop tracking changes to the specified
files. bzr will delete them if they can easily be recovered
using revert. If no options or parameters are given bzr will
scan for files that are being tracked by bzr but missing in
your tree and stop tracking them for you.</p>

<p>bzr remove-tree [LOCATION] Options: --force Remove the
working tree even if it has uncommitted changes. --help, -h
Show help message. --quiet, -q Only display errors and
warnings. --usage Show usage message and options. --verbose,
-v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: checkout, working-trees</p>

<p>Remove the working tree from a given
branch/checkout.</p>

<p>Since a lightweight checkout is little more than a
working tree this will refuse to run against one.</p>

<p>To re-create the working tree, use &quot;bzr
checkout&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr rename Alias for &quot;mv&quot;, see &quot;bzr

<p>See also: status</p>

<p>Show list of renamed files.</p>

<p>bzr resolve [FILE...] Options: --all Resolve all
conflicts in this tree. --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --usage Show
usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>Alias: resolved</p>

<p>See also: conflicts</p>

<p>Mark a conflict as resolved.</p>

<p>Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two
branches, but there are some kinds of problems only a human
can fix. When it encoun- ters those, it will mark a
conflict. A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you should commit.</p>

<p>Once you have fixed a problem, use &quot;bzr
resolve&quot; to automatically mark text conflicts as fixed,
&quot;bzr resolve FILE&quot; to mark a specific conflict as
resolved, or &quot;bzr resolve --all&quot; to mark all
conflicts as resolved.</p>

<p>bzr resolved Alias for &quot;resolve&quot;, see
&quot;bzr resolve&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr revert [FILE...] Options: --forget-merges Remove
pending merge marker, without changing any files. --help, -h
Show help message. --no-backup Do not save backups of
reverted files. --quiet, -q Only display errors and
warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --usage Show usage message
and options. --verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>See also: cat, export</p>

<p>Revert files to a previous revision.</p>

<p>Giving a list of files will revert only those files.
Otherwise, all files will be reverted. If the revision is
not specified with &acute;--revi- sion&acute;, the last
committed revision is used.</p>

<p>To remove only some changes, without reverting to a
prior version, use merge instead. For example, &quot;merge .
--revision -2..-3&quot; will remove the changes introduced
by -2, without affecting the changes introduced by -1. Or to
remove certain changes on a hunk-by-hunk basis, see the
Shelf plugin.</p>

<p>By default, any files that have been manually changed
will be backed up first. (Files changed only by merge are
not backed up.) Backup files have &acute;.~#~&acute;
appended to their name, where # is a number.</p>

<p>When you provide files, you can use their current
pathname or the path- name from the target revision. So you
can use revert to &quot;undelete&quot; a file by name. If
you name a directory, all the contents of that direc- tory
will be reverted.</p>

<p>If you have newly added files since the target revision,
they will be removed. If the files to be removed have been
changed, backups will be created as above. Directories
containing unknown files will not be deleted.</p>

<p>The working tree contains a list of revisions that have
been merged but not yet committed. These revisions will be
included as additional par- ents of the next commit.
Normally, using revert clears that list as well as reverting
the files. If any files are specified, revert leaves the
list of uncommitted merges alone and reverts only the files.
Use &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr revert and &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr revert
--forget-merges&lsquo;&lsquo; to clear the pending merge
list without reverting any files.</p>

<p>Using &quot;bzr revert --forget-merges&quot;, it is
possible to apply all of the changes from a branch in a
single revision. To do this, perform the merge as desired.
Then doing revert with the &quot;--forget-merges&quot;
option will keep the content of the tree as it was, but it
will clear the list of pending merges. The next commit will
then contain all of the changes that are present in the
other branch, but without any other parent revisions.
Because this technique forgets where these changes
originated, it may cause additional conflicts on later
merges involving the same source and target branches.</p>

<p>See also: merge, pull</p>

<p>Mail or create a merge-directive for submitting
changes.</p>

<p>A merge directive provides many things needed for
requesting merges:</p>

<p>* A machine-readable description of the merge to
perform</p>

<p>* An optional patch that is a preview of the changes
requested</p>

<p>* An optional bundle of revision data, so that the
changes can be applied directly from the merge directive,
without retrieving data from a branch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;bzr send&lsquo; creates a compact data set that,
when applied using bzr merge, has the same effect as merging
from the source branch.</p>

<p>By default the merge directive is self-contained and can
be applied to any branch containing submit_branch in its
ancestory without needing access to the source branch.</p>

<p>If --no-bundle is specified, then Bazaar doesn&acute;t
send the contents of the revisions, but only a structured
request to merge from the pub- lic_location. In that case
the public_branch is needed and it must be up-to-date and
accessible to the recipient. The public_branch is always
included if known, so that people can check it later.</p>

<p>The submit branch defaults to the parent of the source
branch, but can be overridden. Both submit branch and public
branch will be remembered in branch.conf the first time they
are used for a particular branch. The source branch defaults
to that containing the working directory, but can be changed
using --from.</p>

<p>In order to calculate those changes, bzr must analyse
the submit branch. Therefore it is most efficient for the
submit branch to be a local mirror. If a public location is
known for the submit_branch, that location is used in the
merge directive.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to send the merge directive by
mail, unless -o is given, in which case it is sent to a
file.</p>

<p>Mail is sent using your preferred mail program. This
should be trans- parent on Windows (it uses MAPI). On Linux,
it requires the xdg-email utility. If the preferred client
can&acute;t be found (or used), your editor will be
used.</p>

<p>To use a specific mail program, set the mail_client
configuration option. (For Thunderbird 1.5, this works
around some bugs.) Supported values for specific clients are
&quot;claws&quot;, &quot;evolution&quot;, &quot;kmail&quot;,
&quot;mail.app&quot; (MacOS X&acute;s Mail.app),
&quot;mutt&quot;, and &quot;thunderbird&quot;; generic
options are &quot;default&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;,
&quot;emacsclient&quot;, &quot;mapi&quot;, and
&quot;xdg-email&quot;. Plugins may also add supported
clients.</p>

<p>If mail is being sent, a to address is required. This
can be supplied either on the commandline, by setting the
submit_to configuration option in the branch itself or the
child_submit_to configuration option in the submit
branch.</p>

<p>Two formats are currently supported: &quot;4&quot; uses
revision bundle format 4 and merge directive format 2. It is
significantly faster and smaller than older formats. It is
compatible with Bazaar 0.19 and later. It is the default.
&quot;0.9&quot; uses revision bundle format 0.9 and merge
direc- tive format 1. It is compatible with Bazaar 0.12 -
0.18.</p>

<p>The merge directives created by bzr send may be applied
using bzr merge or bzr pull by specifying a file containing
a merge directive as the location.</p>

<p>bzr send makes extensive use of public locations to map
local locations into URLs that can be used by other people.
See &lsquo;bzr help configura- tion&lsquo; to set them, and
use &lsquo;bzr info&lsquo; to display them.</p>

<p>bzr serve Options: --allow-writes By default the server
is a readonly server. Supplying --allow-writes enables write
access to the contents of the served directory and below.
Note that &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr serve&lsquo;&lsquo; does not
perform authentication, so unless some form of external
authentication is arranged supplying this option leads to
global uncontrolled write access to your file system.
--directory ARG Serve contents of this directory. --help, -h
Show help message. --inet Serve on stdin/out for use from
inetd or sshd. --port ARG Listen for connections on
nominated port of the form [hostname:]portnumber. Passing 0
as the port number will result in a dynamically allocated
port. The default port depends on the protocol. --protocol
ARG Protocol to serve. --bzr The Bazaar smart server
protocol over TCP. (default port: 4155) --quiet, -q Only
display errors and warnings. --usage Show usage message and
options. --verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Alias: server</p>

<p>bzr shelve [FILE...] Options: --all Shelve all changes.
--destroy Destroy removed changes instead of shelving them.
--help, -h Show help message. --list List shelved changes.
--message ARG, -m Message string. --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help

--writer ARG Method to use for writing diffs. --plain
Plaintext diff output.</p>

<p>See also: unshelve</p>

<p>Temporarily set aside some changes from the current
tree.</p>

<p>Shelve allows you to temporarily put changes
you&acute;ve made &quot;on the shelf&quot;, ie. out of the
way, until a later time when you can bring them back from
the shelf with the &acute;unshelve&acute; command. The
changes are stored alongside your working tree, and so they
aren&acute;t propagated along with your branch nor will they
survive its deletion.</p>

<p>If shelve --list is specified, previously-shelved
changes are listed.</p>

<p>Shelve is intended to help separate several sets of
changes that have been inappropriately mingled. If you just
want to get rid of all changes and you don&acute;t need to
restore them later, use revert. If you want to shelve all
text changes at once, use shelve --all.</p>

<p>If filenames are specified, only the changes to those
files will be shelved. Other files will be left
untouched.</p>

<p>If a revision is specified, changes since that revision
will be shelved.</p>

<p>You can put multiple items on the shelf, and by default,
&acute;unshelve&acute; will restore the most recently
shelved changes.</p>

<p>bzr sign-my-commits [LOCATION] [COMMITTER] Options:
--dry-run Don&acute;t actually sign anything, just print the
revisions that would be signed. --help, -h Show help

--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v
Display more information.</p>

<p>Sign all commits by a given committer.</p>

<p>If location is not specified the local tree is used. If
committer is not specified the default committer is
used.</p>

<p>This does not sign commits that already have
signatures.</p>

<p>bzr split TREE Options: --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --usage Show
usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more

<p>See also: join</p>

<p>Split a subdirectory of a tree into a separate tree.</p>

<p>This command will produce a target tree in a format that
supports rich roots, like &acute;rich-root&acute; or
&acute;rich-root-pack&acute;. These formats cannot be
converted into earlier formats like
&acute;dirstate-tags&acute;.</p>

<p>The TREE argument should be a subdirectory of a working
tree. That subdirectory will be converted into an
independent tree, with its own branch. Commits in the
top-level tree will not apply to the new sub- tree.</p>

<p>bzr st Alias for &quot;status&quot;, see &quot;bzr

<p>Aliases: st, stat</p>

<p>See also: diff, revert, status-flags</p>

<p>Display status summary.</p>

<p>This reports on versioned and unknown files, reporting
them grouped by state. Possible states are:</p>

<p>added Versioned in the working copy but not in the
previous revision.</p>

<p>removed Versioned in the previous revision but removed
or deleted in the working copy.</p>

<p>renamed Path of this file changed from the previous
revision; the text may also have changed. This includes
files whose parent directory was renamed.</p>

<p>modified Text has changed since the previous
revision.</p>

<p>kind changed File kind has been changed (e.g. from file
to directory).</p>

<p>unknown Not versioned and not matching an ignore
pattern.</p>

<p>Additionally for directories, symlinks and files with an
executable bit, Bazaar indicates their type using a trailing
character: &acute;/&acute;, &acute;@&acute; or
&acute;*&acute; respectively.</p>

<p>To see ignored files use &acute;bzr ignored&acute;. For
details on the changes to file texts, use &acute;bzr
diff&acute;.</p>

<p>Note that --short or -S gives status flags for each
item, similar to Subversion&acute;s status command. To get
output similar to svn -q, use bzr status -SV.</p>

<p>If no arguments are specified, the status of the entire
working direc- tory is shown. Otherwise, only the status of
the specified files or directories is reported. If a
directory is given, status is reported for everything inside
that directory.</p>

<p>Before merges are committed, the pending merge tip
revisions are shown. To see all pending merge revisions, use
the -v option. To skip the display of pending merge
information altogether, use the no-pending option or specify
a file/directory.</p>

<p>If a revision argument is given, the status is
calculated against that revision, or between two revisions
if two are provided.</p>

<p>bzr switch [TO_LOCATION] Options: --create-branch, -b
Create the target branch from this one before switching to
it. --force Switch even if local commits will be lost.
--help, -h Show help message. --quiet, -q Only display
errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See &quot;help
revisionspec&quot; for details. --usage Show usage message
and options. --verbose, -v Display more information.</p>

<p>Set the branch of a checkout and update.</p>

<p>For lightweight checkouts, this changes the branch being
referenced. For heavyweight checkouts, this checks that
there are no local commits versus the current bound branch,
then it makes the local branch a mir- ror of the new
location and binds to it.</p>

<p>In both cases, the working tree is updated and
uncommitted changes are merged. The user can commit or
revert these as they desire.</p>

<p>Pending merges need to be committed or reverted before
using switch.</p>

<p>The path to the branch to switch to can be specified
relative to the parent directory of the current branch. For
example, if you are cur- rently in a checkout of
/path/to/branch, specifying &acute;newbranch&acute; will
find a branch at /path/to/newbranch.</p>

<p>Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch
unless it is set locally, in which case switching will
update the local nickname to be that of the master.</p>

<p>bzr tag TAG_NAME Options: --delete Delete this tag
rather than placing it. --directory ARG, -d Branch in which

<p>See also: commit, tags</p>

<p>Create, remove or modify a tag naming a revision.</p>

<p>Tags give human-meaningful names to revisions. Commands
that take a -r (--revision) option can be given -rtag:X,
where X is any previously created tag.</p>

<p>Tags are stored in the branch. Tags are copied from one
branch to another along when you branch, push, pull or
merge.</p>

<p>It is an error to give a tag name that already exists
unless you pass --force, in which case the tag is moved to
point to the new revision.</p>

<p>To rename a tag (change the name but keep it on the same
revsion), run &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr tag new-name -r
tag:old-name&lsquo;&lsquo; and then &lsquo;&lsquo;bzr tag
--delete old- name&lsquo;&lsquo;.</p>

<p>bzr tags Options: --directory ARG, -d Branch whose tags
should be displayed. --help, -h Show help message. --quiet,

usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>See also: bind, checkouts</p>

<p>Convert the current checkout into a regular branch.</p>

<p>After unbinding, the local branch is considered
independent and subse- quent commits will be local only.</p>

<p>bzr uncommit [LOCATION] Options: --dry-run Don&acute;t
actually make changes. --force Say yes to all questions.
--help, -h Show help message. --local Only remove the
commits from the local branch when in a checkout. --quiet,
-q Only display errors and warnings. --revision ARG, -r See
&quot;help revisionspec&quot; for details. --usage Show
usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>See also: commit</p>

<p>Remove the last committed revision.</p>

<p>--verbose will print out what is being removed.
--dry-run will go through all the motions, but not actually
remove anything.</p>

<p>If --revision is specified, uncommit revisions to leave
the branch at the specified revision. For example, &quot;bzr
uncommit -r 15&quot; will leave the branch at revision
15.</p>

<p>Uncommit leaves the working tree ready for a new commit.
The only change it may make is to restore any pending merges
that were present before the commit.</p>

<p>bzr unshelve [SHELF_ID] Options: --action ARG The action
to perform. --apply Apply changes and remove from the shelf.

usage message and options. --verbose, -v Display more
information.</p>

<p>See also: shelve</p>

<p>Restore shelved changes.</p>

<p>By default, the most recently shelved changes are
restored. However if you specify a shelf by id those changes
will be restored instead. This works best when the changes
don&acute;t depend on each other.</p>

<p>bzr up Alias for &quot;update&quot;, see &quot;bzr
update&quot;.</p>

<p>bzr update [DIR] Options: --help, -h Show help message.
--quiet, -q Only display errors and warnings. --revision
ARG, -r See &quot;help revisionspec&quot; for details.
--usage Show usage message and options. --verbose, -v

<p>Alias: up</p>

<p>See also: pull, status-flags, working-trees</p>

<p>Update a tree to have the latest code committed to its
branch.</p>

<p>This will perform a merge into the working tree, and may
generate con- flicts. If you have any local changes, you
will still need to commit them after the update for the
update to be complete.</p>

<p>If you want to discard your local changes, you can just
do a &acute;bzr revert&acute; instead of &acute;bzr
commit&acute; after the update.</p>

<p>If the tree&acute;s branch is bound to a master branch,
it will also update the branch from the master.</p>

<p>bzr upgrade [URL] Options: --format ARG Upgrade to a
specific format. See &quot;bzr help formats&quot; for

VERSION_INFO</p>

<p>will produce a C header file with formatted string
containing the cur- rent revision number. Other supported
variables in templates are:</p>

<p>* {date} - date of the last revision * {build_date} -
current date * {revno} - revision number * {revision_id} -
revision id * {branch_nick} - branch nickname * {clean} - 0
if the source tree contains uncommitted changes, otherwise
1</p>

<p>Manage filtered views.</p>

<p>Views provide a mask over the tree so that users can
focus on a subset of a tree when doing their work. After
creating a view, commands that support a list of files -
status, diff, commit, etc - effectively have that list of
files implicitly given each time. An explicit list of files
can still be given but those files must be within the
current view.</p>

<p>In most cases, a view has a short life-span: it is
created to make a selected change and is deleted once that
change is committed. At other times, you may wish to create
one or more named views and switch between them.</p>

<p>To disable the current view without deleting it, you can
switch to the pseudo view called
&lsquo;&lsquo;off&lsquo;&lsquo;. This can be useful when you
need to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g.
merge) but want to switch back to your view after that.</p>

<p>Examples: To define the current view:</p>

<p>bzr view file1 dir1 ...</p>

<p>To list the current view:</p>

<p>bzr view</p>

<p>To delete the current view:</p>

<p>bzr view --delete</p>

<p>To disable the current view without deleting it:</p>

<p>bzr view --switch off</p>

<p>To define a named view and switch to it:</p>

<p>bzr view --name view-name file1 dir1 ...</p>

<p>To list a named view:</p>

<p>bzr view --name view-name</p>

<p>To delete a named view:</p>

<p>bzr view --name view-name --delete</p>

<p>To switch to a named view:</p>

<p>bzr view --switch view-name</p>

<p>To list all views defined:</p>

<p>bzr view --all</p>

<p>To delete all views:</p>

<p>bzr view --delete --all</p>

<p>EDITOR Editor for editing commit messages</p>

<p>BZR_PLUGIN_PATH Paths where bzr should look for
plugins</p>

<p>BZR_HOME Home directory for bzr</p>

<p>FILES ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf Contains the user&acute;s
default configuration. The section [DEFAULT] is used to
define general configuration that will be applied
everywhere. The section [ALIASES] can be used to create
command aliases for commonly used options.</p>

<p>A typical config file might look something like:</p>

<p>[DEFAULT] email=John Doe &lt;jdoe@isp.com&gt; [ALIASES]
commit = commit --strict log10 = log --short -r -10..-1</p>
