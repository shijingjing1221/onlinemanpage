<p>ARCH_PRCTL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
ARCH_PRCTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME arch_prctl - set architecture-specific thread
state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;asm/prctl.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/prctl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int arch_prctl(int code, unsigned long addr); int
arch_prctl(int code, unsigned long *addr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The arch_prctl() function sets
architecture-specific process or thread state. code selects
a subfunction and passes argument addr to it; addr is
interpreted as either an unsigned long for the
&quot;set&quot; operations, or as an unsigned long *, for
the &quot;get&quot; operations.</p>

<p>Sub functions for x86-64 are:</p>

<p>ARCH_SET_FS Set the 64-bit base for the FS register to
addr.</p>

<p>ARCH_GET_FS Return the 64-bit base value for the FS
register of the current thread in the unsigned long pointed
to by addr.</p>

<p>ARCH_SET_GS Set the 64-bit base for the GS register to
addr.</p>

<p>ARCH_GET_GS Return the 64-bit base value for the GS
register of the current thread in the unsigned long pointed
to by addr.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, arch_prctl() returns 0; on
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT addr points to an unmapped address or is
outside the process address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL code is not a valid subcommand.</p>

<p>EPERM addr is outside the process address space.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO arch_prctl() is a Linux/x86-64 extension
and should not be used in pro- grams intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>NOTES arch_prctl() is only supported on Linux/x86-64 for
64-bit programs cur- rently.</p>

<p>The 64-bit base changes when a new 32-bit segment
selector is loaded.</p>

<p>ARCH_SET_GS is disabled in some kernels.</p>

<p>Context switches for 64-bit segment bases are rather
expensive. It may be a faster alternative to set a 32-bit
base using a segment selector by setting up an LDT with
modify_ldt(2) or using the set_thread_area(2) system call in
kernel 2.5 or later. arch_prctl() is only needed when you
want to set bases that are larger than 4GB. Memory in the
first 2GB of address space can be allocated by using mmap(2)
with the MAP_32BIT flag.</p>

<p>As of version 2.7, glibc provides no prototype for
arch_prctl(). You have to declare it yourself for now. This
may be fixed in future glibc versions.</p>

<p>FS may be already used by the threading library.</p>
