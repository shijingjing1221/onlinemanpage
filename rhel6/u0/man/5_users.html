<p>USERS(5) FreeRADIUS user authorization file USERS(5)</p>

<p>NAME users - user authorization file for the FreeRADIUS
server</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The users file resides in the RADIUS
database directory, by default /etc/raddb. It contains a
series of configuration directives which are used by the
files module to decide how to authorize and authenticate
each user request.</p>

<p>Every line starting with a hash sign (#) is treated as
comment and ignored.</p>

<p>Each entry of the file begins with a username, followed
by a (possibly empty) list of check items, all on one line.
The next line begins with a tab, and a (possibly empty) list
of reply items. Each item in the check or reply item list is
an attribute of the form name = value. Multiple items may be
placed on one line, in which case they must be seperated by
commas. The reply items may be specified over multiple
lines, in which case each line must end with a comma, and
the last line of the reply items must not end with a
comma.</p>

<p>The check items are a list of attributes used to match
the incoming request. If the username matches, AND all of
the check items match the incoming request, then the reply
items are added to the list of attributes which will be used
in the reply to that request. This pro- cess is repeated for
all of the entries in the users file.</p>

<p>If the incoming request matches NO entry, then the
request is rejected.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The special username DEFAULT matches any
usernames.</p>

<p>The entries are processed in order, from the top of the
users file, on down. If an entry contains the special item
Fall-Through = No as a reply attribute, then the processing
of the file stops, and no more entries are matched. Any
reply item list without any Fall-Through attribute is
treated as though it included a Fall-Through = No
attribute.</p>

<p>If an entry contains the special item Fall-Through = Yes
as a reply attribute, then the processing proceeds to the
next entry in order.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when using Fall-Through. The server
should be tested in debugging mode with a number of test
requests, in order to verify that the configured entries
behave as expected.</p>

<p>The special attribute Auth-Type is used to identify the
authentication type to be used for that user. See the
dictionary file for a list of permitted values for the
Auth-Type attribute.</p>

<p>Once the users file has been processed, the request is
authenticated, using the method given by Auth-Type.</p>

<p>OPERATORS Additional operators other than = may be used
for the attributes in either the check item, or reply item
list. The following is a list of operators, and their
meaning.</p>

<p>Attribute = Value Not allowed as a check item for RADIUS
protocol attributes. It is allowed for server configuration
attributes (Auth-Type, etc), and sets the value of on
attribute, only if there is no other item of the same
attribute. As a reply item, it means &quot;add the item to
the reply list, but only if there is no other item of the
same attribute.&quot;</p>

<p>Attribute := Value Always matches as a check item, and
replaces in the configuration items any attribute of the
same name. If no attribute of that name appears in the
request, then this attribute is added. As a reply item, it
has an identical meaning, but for the reply items, instead
of the request items.</p>

<p>Attribute == Value As a check item, it matches if the
named attribute is present in the request, AND has the given
value. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute += Value Always matches as a check item, and
adds the current attribute with value to the list of
configuration items. As a reply item, it has an identical
meaning, but the attribute is added to the reply items.</p>

<p>Attribute != Value As a check item, matches if the given
attribute is in the request, AND does not have the given
value. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute &gt; Value As a check item, it matches if the
request contains an attribute with a value greater than the
one given. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute &gt;= Value As a check item, it matches if the
request contains an attribute with a value greater than, or
equal to the one given. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute &lt; Value As a check item, it matches if the
request contains an attribute with a value less than the one
given. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute &lt;= Value As a check item, it matches if the
request contains an attribute with a value less than, or
equal to the one given. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute =~ Expression As a check item, it matches if
the request contains an attribute which matches the given
regular expression. This operator may only be applied to
string attributes. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute !~ Expression As a check item, it matches if
the request contains an attribute which does not match the
given regular expression. This operator may only be applied
to string attributes. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute =* Value As a check item, it matches if the
request contains the named attribute, no matter what the
value is. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>Attribute !* Value As a check item, it matches if the
request does not contain the named attribute, no matter what
the value is. Not allowed as a reply item.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES bob Cleartext-Password := &quot;hello&quot;</p>

<p>Requests containing the User-Name attribute, with value
&quot;bob&quot;, will be authenticated using the &quot;known
good&quot; password &quot;hello&quot;. There are no reply
items, so the reply will be empty.</p>

<p>DEFAULT Auth-Type = System Fall-Through = Yes</p>

<p>For all users reaching this entry, perform
authentication against the system, unless Auth-Type has
already been set. Also, process any following entries which
may match.</p>

<p>DEFAULT Service-Type == Framed-User, Framed-Protocol ==
PPP Service-Type = Framed-User, Framed-Protocol = PPP,
Fall-Through = Yes</p>

<p>If the request packet contains the attributes
Service-Type and Framed-Protocol, with the given values,
then include those attributes in the reply.</p>

<p>That is, give the user what they ask for. This entry
also shows how to specify multiple reply items.</p>

<p>See the users file supplied with the server for more
examples and com- ments.</p>

<p>HINTS Run the server in debugging mode (-X), and use the
radclient program to send it test packets which you think
will match specific entries. The server will print out which
entries were matched for that request, so you can verify
your expectations. This should be the FIRST thing you do if
you suspect problems with the file.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when writing entries for the users
file. It is easy to misconfigure the server so that requests
are accepted when you wish to reject them. The entries
should be ordered, and the Fall- Through item should be used
ONLY where it is required.</p>

<p>Entries rejecting certain requests should go at the top
of the file, and should not have a Fall-Through item in
their reply items. Entries for specific users, who do not
have a Fall-Through item, should come next. Any DEFAULT
entries should usually come last, except as fall- through
entries that set reply attributes.</p>
