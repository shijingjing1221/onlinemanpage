<p>Tk_Init(3) Tk Library Procedures Tk_Init(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_Init, Tk_SafeInit - add Tk to an interpreter and
make a new Tk application.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_Init(interp)</p>

<p>int Tk_SafeInit(interp)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to load Tk. Tk should not already be loaded in this
interpreter.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_Init is the package initialization
procedure for Tk. It is normally invoked by the Tcl_AppInit
procedure for an application or by the load command. Tk_Init
adds all of Tks commands to interp and creates a new Tk
application, including its main window. If the
initialization is successful Tk_Init returns TCL_OK; if
there is an error it returns TCL_ERROR. Tk_Init also leaves
a result or error message in interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>If there is a variable argv in interp, Tk_Init treats
the contents of this variable as a list of options for the
new Tk application. The options may have any of the forms
documented for the wish application (in fact, wish uses
Tk_Init to process its command-line arguments).</p>

<p>Tk_SafeInit is identical to Tk_Init except that it
removes all Tk com- mands that are considered unsafe. Those
commands and the reasons for their exclusion are:</p>

<p>bell Continuous ringing of the bell is a nuisance.</p>

<p>clipboard A malicious script could replace the contents
of the clipboard with the string rm -r * and lead to
surprises when the con- tents of the clipboard are
pasted.</p>

<p>grab Grab can be used to block the user from using any
other applica- tions.</p>

<p>menu Menus can be used to cover the entire screen and to
steal input from the user.</p>

<p>selection See clipboard.</p>

<p>send Send can be used to cause unsafe interpreters to
execute com- mands.</p>

<p>tk The tk command recreates the send command, which is
unsafe.</p>

<p>tkwait Tkwait can block the containing process
forever</p>

<p>toplevel Toplevels can be used to cover the entire
screen and to steal input from the user.</p>

<p>wm If toplevels are ever allowed, wm can be used to
remove decora- tions, move windows around, etc.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS safe, application, initialization, load, main
window</p>
