<p>POD2TEXT(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
POD2TEXT(1)</p>

<p>NAME pod2text - Convert POD data to formatted ASCII
text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pod2text [-aclostu] [--code] [-i indent] [-q
quotes] [--stderr] [-w width] [input [output ...]]</p>

<p>pod2text -h</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pod2text is a front-end for Pod::Text and
its subclasses. It uses them to generate formatted ASCII
text from POD source. It can optionally use either termcap
sequences or ANSI color escape sequences to format the
text.</p>

<p>input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be
embedded in code). If input isn t given, it defaults to
&quot;STDIN&quot;. output, if given, is the file to which to
write the formatted output. If output isnt given, the
formatted output is written to &quot;STDOUT&quot;. Several
POD files can be processed in the same pod2text invocation
(saving module load and compile times) by providing multiple
pairs of input and output files on the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --alt Use an alternate output format that,
among other things, uses a different heading style and marks
&quot;=item&quot; entries with a colon in the left
margin.</p>

<p>--code Include any non-POD text from the input file in
the output as well. Useful for viewing code documented with
POD blocks with the POD rendered and the code left
intact.</p>

<p>-c, --color Format the output with ANSI color escape
sequences. Using this option requires that Term::ANSIColor
be installed on your system.</p>

<p>-i indent, --indent=indent Set the number of spaces to
indent regular text, and the default indentation for
&quot;=over&quot; blocks. Defaults to 4 spaces if this
option isnt given.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print out usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-l, --loose Print a blank line after a
&quot;=head1&quot; heading. Normally, no blank line is
printed after &quot;=head1&quot;, although one is still
printed after &quot;=head2&quot;, because this is the
expected formatting for manual pages; if youre formatting
arbitrary text documents, using this option is
recommended.</p>

<p>-m width, --left-margin=width, --margin=width The width
of the left margin in spaces. Defaults to 0. This is the
margin for all text, including headings, not the amount by
which regular text is indented; for the latter, see -i
option.</p>

<p>-o, --overstrike Format the output with overstrike
printing. Bold text is rendered as character, backspace,
character. Italics and file names are rendered as
underscore, backspace, character. Many pagers, such as less,
know how to convert this to bold or underlined text.</p>

<p>-q quotes, --quotes=quotes Sets the quote marks used to
surround C&lt;&gt; text to quotes. If quotes is a single
character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if
quotes is two characters, the first character is used as the
left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if quotes
is four characters, the first two are used as the left quote
and the second two as the right quote.</p>

<p>quotes may also be set to the special value
&quot;none&quot;, in which case no quote marks are added
around C&lt;&gt; text.</p>

<p>-s, --sentence Assume each sentence ends with two spaces
and try to preserve that spacing. Without this option, all
consecutive whitespace in non- verbatim paragraphs is
compressed into a single space.</p>

<p>--stderr By default, pod2text puts any errors detected
in the POD input in a POD ERRORS section in the output
manual page. If --stderr is given, errors are sent to
standard error instead and the POD ERRORS section is
suppressed.</p>

<p>-t, --termcap Try to determine the width of the screen
and the bold and underline sequences for the terminal from
termcap, and use that information in formatting the output.
Output will be wrapped at two columns less than the width of
your terminal device. Using this option requires that your
system have a termcap file somewhere where Term::Cap can
find it and requires that your system support termios. With
this option, the output of pod2text will contain terminal
control sequences for your current terminal type.</p>

<p>-u, --utf8 By default, pod2text tries to use the same
output encoding as its input encoding (to be
backward-compatible with older versions). This option says
to instead force the output encoding to UTF-8.</p>

<p>Be aware that, when using this option, the input
encoding of your POD source must be properly declared unless
it is US-ASCII or Latin-1. POD input without an
&quot;=encoding&quot; command will be assumed to be in
Latin-1, and if its actually in UTF-8, the output will be
double-encoded. See perlpod(1) for more information on the
&quot;=encoding&quot; command.</p>

<p>-w, --width=width, -width The column at which to wrap
text on the right-hand side. Defaults to 76, unless -t is
given, in which case its two columns less than the width of
your terminal device.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If pod2text fails with errors, see Pod::Text
and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors
might mean. Internally, it can also produce the following
diagnostics:</p>

<p>-c (--color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed (F)
-c or --color were given, but Term::ANSIColor could not be
loaded.</p>

<p>Unknown option: %s (F) An unknown command line option
was given.</p>

<p>In addition, other Getopt::Long error messages may
result from invalid command-line options.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT COLUMNS If -t is given, pod2text will take
the current width of your screen from this environment
variable, if available. It overrides terminal width
information in TERMCAP.</p>

<p>TERMCAP If -t is given, pod2text will use the contents
of this environment variable if available to determine the
correct formatting sequences for your current terminal
device.</p>
