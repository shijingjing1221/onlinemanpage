<p>GIT-FORMAT-PATCH(1) Git Manual GIT-FORMAT-PATCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-format-patch - Prepare patches for e-mail
submission</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git format-patch [-k] [(-o|--output-directory)
&lt;dir&gt; | --stdout] [--no-thread |
--thread[=&lt;style&gt;]]
[(--attach|--inline)[=&lt;boundary&gt;] | --no-attach] [-s |
--signoff] [-n | --numbered | -N | --no-numbered]
[--start-number &lt;n&gt;] [--numbered-files]
[--in-reply-to=Message-Id] [--suffix=.&lt;sfx&gt;]
[--ignore-if-in-upstream] [--subject-prefix=Subject-Prefix]
[--to=&lt;email&gt;] [--cc=&lt;email&gt;] [--cover-letter]
[&lt;common diff options&gt;] [ &lt;since&gt; | &lt;revision
range&gt; ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Prepare each commit with its patch in one
file per commit, formatted to resemble UNIX mailbox format.
The output of this command is convenient for e-mail
submission or for use with git am.</p>

<p>There are two ways to specify which commits to operate
on.</p>

<p>1. A single commit, &lt;since&gt;, specifies that the
commits leading to the tip of the current branch that are
not in the history that leads to the &lt;since&gt; to be
output.</p>

<p>2. Generic &lt;revision range&gt; expression (see
&quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in
git-rev-parse(1)) means the commits in the specified
range.</p>

<p>The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single
&lt;commit&gt;. To apply the second rule, i.e., format
everything since the beginning of history up until
&lt;commit&gt;, use the --root option: git format-patch
--root &lt;commit&gt;. If you want to format only
&lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do this with git format-patch
-1 &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p>By default, each output file is numbered sequentially
from 1, and uses the first line of the commit message
(massaged for pathname safety) as the filename. With the
--numbered-files option, the output file names will only be
numbers, without the first line of the commit appended. The
names of the output files are printed to standard output,
unless the --stdout option is specified.</p>

<p>If -o is specified, output files are created in
&lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise they are created in the current
working directory.</p>

<p>By default, the subject of a single patch is
&quot;[PATCH] First Line&quot; and the subject when multiple
patches are output is &quot;[PATCH n/m] First Line&quot;. To
force 1/1 to be added for a single patch, use -n. To omit
patch numbers from the subject, use -N.</p>

<p>If given --thread, git-format-patch will generate
In-Reply-To and References headers to make the second and
subsequent patch mails appear as replies to the first mail;
this also generates a Message-Id header to reference.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p, --no-stat Generate plain patches without any
diffstats.</p>

<p>-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt; Generate diffs with
&lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.</p>

<p>--patience Generate a diff using the &quot;patience
diff&quot; algorithm.</p>

<p>--stat[=width[,name-width]] Generate a diffstat. You can
override the default output width for 80-column terminal by
--stat=width. The width of the filename part can be
controlled by giving another width to it separated by a
comma.</p>

<p>--numstat Similar to --stat, but shows number of added
and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary
files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p>--shortstat Output only the last line of the --stat
format containing total number of modified files, as well as
number of added and deleted lines.</p>

<p>--dirstat[=limit] Output the distribution of relative
amount of changes (number of lines added or removed) for
each sub-directory. Directories with changes below a cut-off
percent (3% by default) are not shown. The cut-off percent
can be set with --dirstat=limit. Changes in a child
directory is not counted for the parent directory, unless
--cumulative is used.</p>

<p>--dirstat-by-file[=limit] Same as --dirstat, but counts
changed files instead of lines.</p>

<p>--summary Output a condensed summary of extended header
information such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p>--no-renames Turn off rename detection, even when the
configuration file gives the default to do so.</p>

<p>--full-index Instead of the first handful of characters,
show the full pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p>--binary In addition to --full-index, output a binary
diff that can be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p>--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal object name in diff-raw format output and
diff-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix. This is
independent of the --full-index option above, which controls
the diff-patch output format. Non default number of digits
can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>-B Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete
and create.</p>

<p>-M Detect renames.</p>

<p>-C Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder.</p>

<p>--find-copies-harder For performance reasons, by
default, -C option finds copies only if the original file of
the copy was modified in the same changeset. This flag makes
the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large
projects, so use it with caution. Giving more than one -C
option has the same effect.</p>

<p>-l&lt;num&gt; The -M and -C options require O(n^2)
processing time where n is the number of potential
rename/copy targets. This option prevents rename/copy
detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets
exceeds the specified number.</p>

<p>-O&lt;orderfile&gt; Output the patch in the order
specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob
pattern per line.</p>

<p>-a, --text Treat all files as text.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-at-eol Ignore changes in whitespace at
EOL.</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change Ignore changes in amount of
whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and
considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space Ignore whitespace when comparing
lines. This ignores differences even if one line has
whitespace where the other line has none.</p>

<p>--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt; Show the context
between diff hunks, up to the specified number of lines,
thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.</p>

<p>--ext-diff Allow an external diff helper to be executed.
If you set an external diff driver with gitattributes(5),
you need to use this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p>--no-ext-diff Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p>--ignore-submodules Ignore changes to submodules in the
diff generation.</p>

<p>--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given source prefix
instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p>--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given destination
prefix instead of &quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-prefix Do not show any source or destination
prefix.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation on these common options,
see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p>-&lt;n&gt; Limits the number of patches to prepare.</p>

<p>-o &lt;dir&gt;, --output-directory &lt;dir&gt; Use
&lt;dir&gt; to store the resulting files, instead of the
current working directory.</p>

<p>-n, --numbered Name output in [PATCH n/m] format, even
with a single patch.</p>

<p>-N, --no-numbered Name output in [PATCH] format.</p>

<p>--start-number &lt;n&gt; Start numbering the patches at
&lt;n&gt; instead of 1.</p>

<p>--numbered-files Output file names will be a simple
number sequence without the default first line of the commit
appended.</p>

<p>-k, --keep-subject Do not strip/add [PATCH] from the
first line of the commit log message.</p>

<p>-s, --signoff Add Signed-off-by: line to the commit
message, using the committer identity of yourself.</p>

<p>--stdout Print all commits to the standard output in
mbox format, instead of creating a file for each one.</p>

<p>--attach[=&lt;boundary&gt;] Create multipart/mixed
attachment, the first part of which is the commit message
and the patch itself in the second part, with
Content-Disposition: attachment.</p>

<p>--no-attach Disable the creation of an attachment,
overriding the configuration setting.</p>

<p>--inline[=&lt;boundary&gt;] Create multipart/mixed
attachment, the first part of which is the commit message
and the patch itself in the second part, with
Content-Disposition: inline.</p>

<p>--thread[=&lt;style&gt;], --no-thread Controls addition
of In-Reply-To and References headers to make the second and
subsequent mails appear as replies to the first. Also
controls generation of the Message-Id header to
reference.</p>

<p>The optional &lt;style&gt; argument can be either
shallow or deep. shallow threading makes every mail a reply
to the head of the series, where the head is chosen from the
cover letter, the --in-reply-to, and the first patch mail,
in this order. deep threading makes every mail a reply to
the previous one.</p>

<p>The default is --no-thread, unless the format.thread
configuration is set. If --thread is specified without a
style, it defaults to the style specified by format.thread
if any, or else shallow.</p>

<p>Beware that the default for git send-email is to thread
emails itself. If you want git format-patch to take care of
threading, you will want to ensure that threading is
disabled for git send-email.</p>

<p>--in-reply-to=Message-Id Make the first mail (or all the
mails with --no-thread) appear as a reply to the given
Message-Id, which avoids breaking threads to provide a new
patch series.</p>

<p>--ignore-if-in-upstream Do not include a patch that
matches a commit in &lt;until&gt;..&lt;since&gt;. This will
examine all patches reachable from &lt;since&gt; but not
from &lt;until&gt; and compare them with the patches being
generated, and any patch that matches is ignored.</p>

<p>--subject-prefix=&lt;Subject-Prefix&gt; Instead of the
standard [PATCH] prefix in the subject line, instead use
[&lt;Subject-Prefix&gt;]. This allows for useful naming of a
patch series, and can be combined with the --numbered
option.</p>

<p>--to=&lt;email&gt; Add a To: header to the email
headers. This is in addition to any configured headers, and
may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>--cc=&lt;email&gt; Add a Cc: header to the email
headers. This is in addition to any configured headers, and
may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>--add-header=&lt;header&gt; Add an arbitrary header to
the email headers. This is in addition to any configured
headers, and may be used multiple times. For example,
--add-header=&quot;Organization: git-foo&quot;</p>

<p>--cover-letter In addition to the patches, generate a
cover letter file containing the shortlog and the overall
diffstat. You can fill in a description in the file before
sending it out.</p>

<p>--suffix=.&lt;sfx&gt; Instead of using .patch as the
suffix for generated filenames, use specified suffix. A
common alternative is --suffix=.txt. Leaving this empty will
remove the .patch suffix.</p>

<p>Note that the leading character does not have to be a
dot; for example, you can use --suffix=-patch to get
0001-description-of-my-change-patch.</p>

<p>--no-binary Do not output contents of changes in binary
files, instead display a notice that those files changed.
Patches generated using this option cannot be applied
properly, but they are still useful for code review.</p>

<p>--root Treat the revision argument as a &lt;revision
range&gt;, even if it is just a single commit (that would
normally be treated as a &lt;since&gt;). Note that root
commits included in the specified range are always formatted
as creation patches, independently of this flag.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION You can specify extra mail header lines to
be added to each message, defaults for the subject prefix
and file suffix, number patches when outputting more than
one patch, add &quot;To&quot; or &quot;Cc:&quot; headers,
configure attachments, and sign off patches with
configuration variables.</p>

<p>[format] headers = &quot;Organization: git-foo0
subjectprefix = CHANGE suffix = .txt numbered = auto to =
&lt;email&gt; cc = &lt;email&gt; attach [ =
mime-boundary-string ] signoff = true</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &middot; Extract commits between revisions R1
and R2, and apply them on top of the current branch using
git am to cherry-pick them:</p>

<p>$ git format-patch -k --stdout R1..R2 | git am -3 -k</p>

<p>&middot; Extract all commits which are in the current
branch but not in the origin branch:</p>

<p>$ git format-patch origin</p>

<p>For each commit a separate file is created in the
current directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Extract all commits that lead to origin since
the inception of the project:</p>

<p>$ git format-patch --root origin</p>

<p>&middot; The same as the previous one:</p>

<p>$ git format-patch -M -B origin</p>

<p>Additionally, it detects and handles renames and
complete rewrites intelligently to produce a renaming patch.
A renaming patch reduces the amount of text output, and
generally makes it easier to review. Note that non-git
&quot;patch&quot; programs wont understand renaming patches,
so use it only when you know the recipient uses git to apply
your patch.</p>

<p>&middot; Extract three topmost commits from the current
branch and format them as e-mailable patches:</p>

<p>$ git format-patch -3</p>
