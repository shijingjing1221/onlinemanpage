<p>TPUT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TPUT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tput - change terminal characteristics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tput [-T type] operand...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tput utility shall display
terminal-dependent information. The manner in which this
information is retrieved is unspecified. The information
displayed shall clear the terminal screen, initialize the
users terminal, or reset the users terminal, depending on
the operand given. The exact consequences of displaying this
information are unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The tput utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-T type Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is
not supplied and the TERM variable is unset or null, an
unspecified default terminal type shall be used. The setting
of type shall take precedence over the value in TERM.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following strings shall be supported as
operands by the implementa- tion in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p>clear Display the clear-screen sequence.</p>

<p>init Display the sequence that initializes the user s
terminal in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p>reset Display the sequence that resets the users
terminal in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p>If a terminal does not support any of the operations
described by these operands, this shall not be considered an
error condition.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of tput:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TERM Determine the terminal type. If this variable is
unset or null, and if the -T option is not specified, an
unspecified default terminal type shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If standard output is a terminal device, it may
be used for writing the appropriate sequence to clear the
screen or reset or initialize the terminal. If standard
output is not a terminal device, undefined results
occur.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The requested string was written successfully.</p>

<p>1 Unspecified.</p>

<p>2 Usage error.</p>

<p>3 No information is available about the specified
terminal type.</p>

<p>4 The specified operand is invalid.</p>

<p>&gt;4 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If one of the operands is not
available for the terminal, tput contin- ues processing the
remaining operands.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The difference between resetting and
initializing a terminal is left unspecified, as they vary
greatly based on hardware types. In general, resetting is a
more severe action.</p>

<p>Some terminals use control characters to perform the
stated functions, and on such terminals it might make sense
to use tput to store the ini- tialization strings in a file
or environment variable for later use. However, because
other terminals might rely on system calls to do this work,
the standard output cannot be used in a portable manner,
such as the following non-portable constructs:</p>

<p>ClearVartput clear tput reset | mailx -s &quot;Wake
Up&quot; ddg</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Initialize the terminal according to the
type of terminal in the environmental variable TERM. This
command can be included in a .profile file.</p>

<p>tput init</p>

<p>2. Reset a 450 terminal.</p>

<p>tput -T 450 reset</p>

<p>RATIONALE The list of operands was reduced to a minimum
for the following rea- sons:</p>

<p>* The only features chosen were those that were likely
to be used by human users interacting with a terminal.</p>

<p>* Specifying the full terminfo set was not considered
desirable, but the standard developers did not want to
select among operands.</p>

<p>* This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not attempt
to provide applications with sophisticated terminal handling
capabilities, as that falls outside of its assigned scope
and intersects with the responsibilities of other standards
bodies.</p>

<p>The difference between resetting and initializing a
terminal is left unspecified as this varies greatly based on
hardware types. In gen- eral, resetting is a more severe
action.</p>

<p>The exit status of 1 is historically reserved for
finding out if a Boolean operand is not set. Although the
operands were reduced to a minimum, the exit status of 1
should still be reserved for the Boolean operands, for those
sites that wish to support them.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
