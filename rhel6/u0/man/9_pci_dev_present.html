<p>PCI_DEV_PRESENT(9) Hardware Interfaces
PCI_DEV_PRESENT(9)</p>

<p>NAME pci_dev_present - Returns 1 if device matching the
device list is present, 0 if not.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int pci_dev_present(const struct pci_device_id
* ids);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ids A pointer to a null terminated list of
struct pci_device_id structures that describe the type of
PCI device the caller is trying to find.</p>

<p>OBVIOUS FACT You do not have a reference to any device
that might be found by this function, so if that device is
removed from the system right after this function is
finished, the value will be stale. Use this function to find
devices that are usually built into a system, or for a
general hint as to if another device happens to be present
at this specific moment in time.</p>
