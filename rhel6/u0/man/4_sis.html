<p>DESCRIPTION sis is an Xorg driver for SiS (Silicon
Integrated Systems) and XGI video chips. The driver is
accelerated and provides support for col- ordepths of 8, 16
and 24 bpp. XVideo, Render and other extensions are
supported as well.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The sis driver supports PCI, AGP and
PCIe video cards based on the fol- lowing chipsets:</p>

<p>SiS5597/5598 SiS530/620 SiS6326/AGP/DVD SiS300/305

V3/V5/V8 XGI Volari Z7</p>

<p>In the following text, the following terms are used:</p>

<p>old series for SiS5597/5598, 530/620 and
6326/AGP/DVD</p>

<p>300 series for SiS300/305, 540 and 630/730</p>

<p>315/330/340 series for SiS315, 55x, 330, 661/741/76x
(plus M, FX, MX, GX variants thereof), 340 and all XGI
chips.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>Detailed information on all supported options can be
obtained at http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisvga.shtml</p>

<p>This manpage only covers a subset of the supported
options.</p>

<p>1. For all supported chipsets</p>

<p>The following driver options are supported on all
chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable 2D acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: HWCursor is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; The
opposite of HWCursor. Default: SWCursor is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;string&quot; Rotate the
display clockwise (&quot;CW&quot;) or counter-clockwise
(&quot;CCW&quot;). This mode is unaccelerated. Using this
option disables XVideo and the Resize and Rotate extension
(RandR). Rotation and reflection (see below) are mutually
exclusive. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Reflect&quot; &quot;string&quot; Reflect
(mirror) the display horizontally (&quot;X&quot;),
vertically (&quot;Y&quot;) or both (&quot;XY&quot;). This
mode is unaccelerated. Using this option disables XVideo and
the Resize and Rotate extension (RandR). Rotation (see
above) and reflection are mutually exclu- sive. Default: no
reflection.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT1Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable gamma correction. (On the 300 and 315/330/340
series, this option only affects CRT1 output). Default:
Gamma correction is enabled.</p>

<p>2. Old series specific information</p>

<p>The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory
present for all these chips, but in the case of the 6326, it
will limit the memory size to 4MB. This is because the 6326s
2D engine can only address 4MB. The remaining memory seems
to be intended for 3D texture data, since only the 3D engine
can address RAM above 4MB. However, you can override this
limitation using the &quot;VideoRAM&quot; option in the
Device section if your board has more than 4MB and you need
to use it. However, 2D accelera- tion, XVideo and the
HWCursor will be disabled in this case.</p>

<p>For the 6326, the driver has two built-in modes for high
resolutions which you should use instead of the default
ones. These are named &quot;SIS1280x1024-75&quot; and
&quot;SIS1600x1200-60&quot; and they will be added to the
list of default modes. To use these modes, just place them
in your Screen section. Example:</p>

<p>Modes &quot;SIS1600x1200-60&quot;
&quot;SIS1280x1024x75&quot; &quot;1024x768&quot; ...</p>

<p>Of these modes, 1280x1024 is only available at 8, 15 and
16bpp. 1600x1200 is available at 8bpp only.</p>

<p>TV support for the 6326</p>

<p>TV output is supported for the 6326. The driver will
auto detect a con- nected TV and in this case add the
following display modes to the list of available display
modes: &quot;PAL800x600&quot;, &quot;PAL800x600U&quot;,
&quot;PAL720x540&quot;, &quot;PAL640x480&quot;,
&quot;NTSC640x480&quot;, &quot;NTSC640x480U&quot; and
&quot;NTSC640x400&quot;. Use these modes like the hi-res
modes described above.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported on the old
series:</p>

<p>Option &quot;TurboQueue&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable TurboQueue mode. Default: off for SIS530/620, on
for the others</p>

<p>Option &quot;FastVram&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable FastVram mode. Enabling this sets the video RAM
timing to one cycle per read operation instead of two
cycles. Disabling this will set two cycles for read and
write operations. Leaving this option out uses the default,
which varies depending on the chipset.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoHostBus&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
(SiS5597/5598 only). Disable CPU-to-VGA host bus support.
This speeds up CPU to video RAM transfers. Default: Host bus
is enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoXVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
XV (XVideo) extension support. Default: XVideo is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoYV12&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
YV12 Xv support. This might me required due to hardware bugs
in some chipsets. Disabling YV12 support forces Xv-aware
applications to use YUV2 or XShm for video output. Default:
YV12 support is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;string&quot; (6326
only) Valid parameters are PAL or NTSC. The default is set
by a jumper on the card.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVXPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
(6326 only) This option allows tuning the horizontal
position of the image for TV output. The range is from -16
to 16. Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVYPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
(6326 only) This option allows tuning the vertical position
of the image for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16.
Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;SIS6326TVEnableYFilter&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; (6326 only) This option allows
enabling/disabling the Y (chroma) filter for TV output.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SIS6326TVAntiFlicker&quot;
&quot;string&quot; (6326 only) This option allow
enabling/disabling the anti flicker facility for TV output.
Possible parameters are OFF, LOW, MED, HIGH or ADAPTIVE. By
experience, ADAPTIVE yields the best results, hence it is
the default.</p>

<p>2. 300 and 315/330/340 series specific information</p>

<p>The 300 and 315/330/340 series, except the XGI Z7,
feature two CRT con- trollers and very often come with a
video bridge for controlling LCD and TV output. Hereinafter,
the term CRT1 refers to the VGA output of the chip, and CRT2
refers to either LCD, TV or secondary VGA. Due to timing
reasons, only one CRT2 output can be active at the same
time. But this limitation does not apply to using CRT1 and
CRT2 at the same time which makes it possible to run the
driver in dual head mode.</p>

<p>The driver supports the following video bridges:</p>

<p>SiS301 SiS301B(-DH) SiS301C SiS301LV SiS302(E)LV</p>

<p>Instead of a video bridge, some machines have a third
party LVDS trans- mitter to control LCD panels, and/or a
Chrontel 7005 or 7019 for TV output. All these are supported
as well.</p>

<p>About TV output</p>

<p>The driver fully supports standard (PAL, NTSC, PAL-N,
PAL-M) S-video or composite output as well as high
definition TV (HDTV) output via YPbPr plugs. For more
information on HDTV, please consult the authors web-
site.</p>

<p>As regards S-video and CVBS output, the SiS301 and the
Chrontel 7005 only support resolutions up to 800x600. All
others support resolutions up to 1024x768. However, due to a
hardware bug, Xvideo might be dis- torted on SiS video
bridges if running NTSC or PAL-M at 1024x768.</p>

<p>About XVideo support</p>

<p>XVideo is supported on all chipsets of both families
(except the XGI Volari Z7 which lacks hardware support for
video overlays). However, there are some differences in
hardware features which cause limita- tions. The 300 series
as well as the SiS55x, M650, 651, 661FX, M661FX, M661MX,
741, 741GX, M741, 76x, M76x support two video overlays. The
SiS315/H/PRO, 650/740, 330, 340 and the XGI Volari V3, V5
and V8 chips support only one such overlay. On chips with
two overlays, one overlay is used for CRT1, the other for
CRT2. On the other chipsets, the option &quot;XvOnCRT2&quot;
can be used to select the desired output device (CRT1 or
CRT2).</p>

<p>About Merged Framebuffer support</p>

<p>Merged framebuffer mode is similar to dual head/Xinerama
mode (for using two output devices of one card at the same
time), but has a few advantages which make me recommend it
strongly over Xinerama. Please see
http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed
informa- tion.</p>

<p>About dual-head support</p>

<p>Dual head mode with or without Xinerama is fully
supported, be it with one card driving two outputs, be it
two cards. Note that colordepth 8 is not supported in dual
head mode if run on one card with two outputs.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported on the 300
and 315/330/340 series:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoXVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
XV (XVideo) extension support. Default: XVideo is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvOnCRT2&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; On
chipsets with only one video overlay, this option can used
to bind the overlay to CRT1 ( if a monitor is detected and
if this option is either unset or set to false ) or CRT2 (
if a CRT2 device is detected or forced, and if this option
is set to true ). If either only CRT1 or CRT2 is detected,
the driver decides automatically. In Merged Framebuffer
mode, this option is ignored. Default: overlay is used on
CRT1</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceCRT1&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force
CRT1 to be on of off. If a monitor is connected, it will be
detected during server start. However, some old monitors are
not detected correctly. In such cases, you may set this
option to on in order to make the driver initialize CRT1
anyway. If this option is set to off , the driver will
switch off CRT1. Default: auto-detect</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceCRT2Type&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Force display type to one of: NONE , TV , SVIDEO , COMPOSITE
, SVIDEO+COMPOSITE , SCART , LCD , VGA ; NONE will disable
CRT2. The SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SVIDEO+COMPOSITE and SCART
parameters are for SiS video bridges only and can be used to
force the driver to use a specific TV output connector (if
present). For further parameters, see the authors website.
Default: auto detect.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT2Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable gamma correction for CRT2. Only supported for SiS
video bridges. Default: Gamma correction for CRT2 is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVStandard&quot; &quot;string&quot; Force
the TV standard to either PAL or NTSC. On some machines with
630, 730 and the 315/330/340 series, PALM , PALN and NTSCJ
are supported as well. Default: BIOS setting.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVXPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option allows tuning the horizontal position of the image
for TV output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on
the Chrontel 7019. Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVYPosOffset&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option allows tuning the vertical position of the image for
TV output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the
Chrontel 7019. Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;SISTVXScale&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option selects the horizontal zooming level for TV output.
The range is from -16 to 16. Only supported on SiS video
bridges. Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;SISTVYScale&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option selects the vertical zooming level for TV output in
the following modes: 640x480, 800x600. On the 315/330/340
series, also 720x480, 720x576 and 768x576. The range is from
-4 to 3. Only supported on SiS video bridges. Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;CHTVOverscan&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; On
machines with a Chrontel TV encoder, this can be used to
force the TV mode to overscan or underscan. on means
overscan, off means underscan. Default: BIOS setting.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CHTVSuperOverscan&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
On machines with a Chrontel 7005 TV encoder, this option
enables a super-overscan mode. This is only supported if the
TV standard is PAL. Super overscan will produce an image on
the TV which is larger than the viewable area.</p>

<p>The driver supports many more options. Please see
http://www.winis- chhofer.at/linuxsisvga.shtml for more
information.</p>

<p>3. 300 series specific information</p>

<p>DRI is supported on the 300 series only. On Linux, prior
to kernel 2.6.3, DRI requires the kernels SiS framebuffer
driver ( sisfb ). The SiS DRM kernel driver as well as the
SiS DRI client driver are required in any case.</p>

<p>Sisfb, if installed and running, takes care of memory
management for texture data. In order to prevent the X
Server and sisfb from overwrit- ing each other s data, sisfb
reserves an amount of video memory for the X driver. This
amount can either be selected using sisfbs mem parame- ter,
or auto-selected depending on the amount of total video RAM
avail- able.</p>

<p>Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as a
complete frame- buffer driver. If you start sisfb with a
valid mode (ie you gain a graphical console), the X driver
can communicate with sisfb and doesnt require any manual
configuration for finding out about the video memory it is
allowed to use.</p>

<p>However, if you are running a 2.4 series Linux kernel
and use sisfb for video memory management only, ie you
started sisfb with mode=none and still have a text mode
console, there is no communication between sisfb and the X
driver. For this purpose, the</p>

<p>Option &quot;MaxXFBMem&quot; &quot;integer&quot;</p>

<p>exists. This option must be set to the same value as
given to sisfb through its &quot;mem&quot; parameter, ie the
amount of memory to use for X in kilobytes.</p>

<p>If you started sisfb without the mem argument, sisfb
will reserve</p>

<p>12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is
available,</p>

<p>8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is
available,</p>

<p>4096KB in all other cases.</p>

<p>If you intend to use DRI on an integrated chipset (540,
630, 730), I recommend setting the total video memory in the
BIOS setup utility to 64MB.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: As of Linux 2.6.3 and under *BSD, sisfb is
not required for memory management. Hence, this option is
mandatory on such systems not running sisfb to decide how
much memory X should reserve for DRI. If the option is
omitted, DRI will have no memory assigned, and all DRI
applications will quit with errors like &quot;failed to
allocate Z-buffer&quot; or the like.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This option
allows enabling or disabling DRI. By default, DRI is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option allows selecting the amount of AGP memory to be used
for DRI. The amount is to be specified in megabyte, the
default is 8.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS none.</p>
