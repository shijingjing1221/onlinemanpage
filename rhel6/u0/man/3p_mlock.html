<p>MLOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mlock, munlock - lock or unlock a range of process
address space (REAL- TIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mlock(const void *addr, size_t len); int
munlock(const void *addr, size_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mlock() function shall cause those whole
pages containing any part of the address space of the
process starting at address addr and con- tinuing for len
bytes to be memory-resident until unlocked or until the
process exits or execs another process image. The
implementation may require that addr be a multiple of
{PAGESIZE}.</p>

<p>The munlock() function shall unlock those whole pages
containing any part of the address space of the process
starting at address addr and continuing for len bytes,
regardless of how many times mlock() has been called by the
process for any of the pages in the specified range. The
implementation may require that addr be a multiple of
{PAGESIZE}.</p>

<p>If any of the pages in the range specified to a call to
munlock() are also mapped into the address spaces of other
processes, any locks established on those pages by another
process are unaffected by the call of this process to
munlock(). If any of the pages in the range specified by a
call to munlock() are also mapped into other portions of the
address space of the calling process outside the range
specified, any locks established on those pages via the
other mappings are also unaffected by this call.</p>

<p>Upon successful return from mlock(), pages in the
specified range shall be locked and memory-resident. Upon
successful return from munlock(), pages in the specified
range shall be unlocked with respect to the address space of
the process. Memory residency of unlocked pages is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The appropriate privilege is required to lock process
memory with mlock().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the mlock() and
munlock() functions shall return a value of zero. Otherwise,
no change is made to any locks in the address space of the
process, and the function shall return a value of -1 and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mlock() and munlock() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Some or all of the address range specified by the
addr and len arguments does not correspond to valid mapped
pages in the address space of the process.</p>

<p>The mlock() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN Some or all of the memory identified by the
operation could not be locked when the call was made.</p>

<p>The mlock() and munlock() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The addr argument is not a multiple of
{PAGESIZE}.</p>

<p>The mlock() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Locking the pages mapped by the specified range
would exceed an implementation-defined limit on the amount
of memory that the process may lock.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process does not have the appropriate
privilege to perform the requested operation.</p>
