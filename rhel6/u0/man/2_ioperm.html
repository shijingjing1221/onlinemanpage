<p>IOPERM(2) Linux Programmer s Manual IOPERM(2)</p>

<p>NAME ioperm - set port input/output permissions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; /* for libc5 */
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt; /* for glibc */</p>

<p>int ioperm(unsigned long from, unsigned long num, int
turn_on);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ioperm() sets the port access permission
bits for the calling process for num bytes starting from
port address from to the value turn_on. If turn_on is
non-zero, the calling process must be privileged
(CAP_SYS_RAWIO).</p>

<p>Only the first 0x3ff I/O ports can be specified in this
manner. For more ports, the iopl(2) system call must be
used.</p>

<p>Permissions are not inherited by the child created by
fork(2). Permis- sions are preserved across execve(2); this
is useful for giving port access permissions to
non-privileged programs.</p>

<p>This call is mostly for the i386 architecture. On many
other architec- tures it does not exist or will always
return an error.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL Invalid values for from or num.</p>

<p>EIO (on PowerPC) This call is not supported.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient
privilege.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO ioperm() is Linux-specific and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Libc5 treats it as a system call and has a
prototype in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. Glibc1 does not have a
prototype. Glibc2 has a prototype both in &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
and in &lt;sys/perm.h&gt;. Avoid the latter, it is available
on i386 only.</p>
