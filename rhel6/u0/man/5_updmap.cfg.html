<p>UPDMAP.CFG(5) UPDMAP.CFG(5)</p>

<p>NAME updmap.cfg - configuration of font
mapping/inclusion for dvips and friends.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file updmap.cfg is the central font
configuration file of a TeX system and is read by updmap(1).
It describes if and how fonts should be included (or not
included) into PS-/PDF-files. This works for Out- line
(Postscript Type1) and Bitmap Fonts (Postscript Type3)
mostly com- ing from MetaFont.</p>

<p>updmap is a utility that creates font configuration
files for dvips(1), pdftex(1), xdvi(1), ps2pk(1),
gsftopk(1), dvipdfm(1) and (soon) dvipdfmx(1). In an ideal
world, updmap would be unnecessary -- each of these programs
would read the same configuration file to learn what fonts
are available and how they should be treated. As things
stand, however, each of these tools has subtly different
requirements and thereby needs its own font configuration
file. updmap creates font configuration files for all of
these programs from a single source, updmap.cfg, allowing
you to easily keep all the different configuration files in
sync.</p>

<p>dvipsPreferOutline Configures if dvips (by default)
should prefer bitmap fonts or outline fonts if both are
available? Independent of this setting, outlines can be
forced by putting &quot;p psfonts_t1.map&quot; into a config
file that dvips reads. Bitmaps can be forced by putting
&quot;p psfonts_pk.map&quot; into a con- fig file. We
provide such config files which can be enabled via dvips
-Poutline ... resp. dvips -Ppk ... Valid settings for
dvipsPreferOutline are true / false.</p>

<p>LW35 Which fonts of the &quot;Basic 35 Laserwriter
Fonts&quot; do you want to use and how are the filenames
chosen? Valid settings: URW: URW fonts with
&quot;vendor&quot; filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb) URWkb: URW
fonts with &quot;berry&quot; filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
ADOBE: Adobe fonts with &quot;vendor&quot; filenames (e.g.
hvnbo___.pfb) ADOBEkb: Adobe fonts with &quot;berry&quot;
filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)</p>

<p>dvipsDownloadBase Configures if dvips (by default)
should download the standard 35 Laser- Writer fonts into the
document (set true) or should these fonts be used from the
ps interpreter / printer (set false). The user can override
the default by specifying dvips -Pdownload35 built-in fonts.
Valid settings are true / false.</p>

<p>pdftexDownloadBase14 Should pdftex download the base 14
pdf fonts? Since some configurations (ps / pdf tools /
printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to down- load
the fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though. Valid
settings are true (download the fonts) or false (dont
download the fonts). Adobe recomments to embed all
fonts.</p>

<p>dvipdfmDownloadBase14 Should dvipdfm download the base
14 pdf fonts? Since some configura- tions (ps / pdf tools /
printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download the
fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though. Valid settings
are true (download the fonts) or false (dont download the
fonts).</p>

<p>Map Points to a map file, which describes a mapping from
a font (called in the TeX document) to the pfb file
containing the Postscript code. Usage: Map filename.map</p>

<p>The syntax of map files is the same as dvips(1) uses,
see section 6.4, &quot;psfonts.map: PostScript font
catalog&quot; in the manual of dvips(1), available as info
and pdf file.</p>

<p>MixedMap Similar to Map. It should be used when there is
Type1 and a bitmap implementation of the font (the latter
mostly coming from MetaFont). These entries will not be used
in the default map of dvips if dvip- sPreferOutline is set
to false. Usage: MixedMap filename.map</p>

<p>The sign # precedes a comment.</p>

<p>Not used Map files should be commented out using the
string #! at the beginning of the line. These entries can be
(de-)activaed using updmap with the options --enable and
--disable.</p>

<p>SPECIAL TO DEBIAN In Debian the file updmap.cfg is a
generated file sitting in /var. It is generated by
concatenating the *.cfg files from /etc/texmf/updmap.d/.
These files follow the syntax of updmap.cfg, but contain
only parts of it.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This manual page was written by Hilmar Preusse
&lt;hille42@web.de&gt;, for the Debian GNU/Linux system by
simply copying the comments from updmap.cfg and rewriting
some of them. It may be used by other distri- butions
without contacting the author. Any mistakes or omissions in
the manual page are my fault; inquiries about or corrections
to this manual page should be directed to me (and not to the
primary author).</p>
