<p>NAME xjc - Java(TM) Architecture for XML Binding Binding
Compiler Specification Version: 2.0 Reference Implementation
(RI) Version: 2.0 ea3</p>

<p>Launching xjc The binding compiler can be launched using
the appropriate xjc shell script in the bin directory for
your platform. We also provide an Ant task to run the
binding complier - see the instructions for using xjc with
Ant.</p>

<p>For Solaris/Linux</p>

<p>% /path/to/jaxb/bin/xjc.sh -help</p>

<p>For WindowsNT/2000/XP</p>

<p>&gt; c:pathtojaxbbinxjc.bat -help</p>

<p>Output</p>

<p>Usage: xjc [-options ...] &lt;schema_file/URL/dir&gt;
... [-b &lt;bindinfo&gt;] ... Options: -nv : do not perform
strict validation of the input schema(s) -extension : allow
vendor extensions - do not strictly follow the Compatibility
Rules and App E.2 from the JAXB Spec -b &lt;file&gt; :
specify external bindings files (each &lt;file&gt; must have
its own -b) -d &lt;dir&gt; : generated files will go into
this directory -p &lt;pkg&gt; : specifies the target package
-httpproxy &lt;proxy&gt; : set HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Format is
[user[:password]@]proxyHost:proxyPort -httpproxyfile
&lt;file&gt;: set the proxy string (same format as above).
-classpath &lt;arg&gt; : specify where to find user class
files -catalog &lt;file&gt; : specify catalog files to
resolve external entity references support TR9401, XCatalog,
and OASIS XML Catalog format. -readOnly : generated files
will be in read-only mode -npa : suppress generation of
package level annotations (**/package-info.java) -xmlschema
: treat input as W3C XML Schema (default) -relaxng : treat
input as RELAX NG (experimental,unsupported)
-relaxng-compact : treat input as RELAX NG compact syntax
(experimental,unsupported) -dtd : treat input as XML DTD
(experimental,unsupported) -wsdl : treat input as WSDL and
compile schemas inside it (experimental,unsupported)
-verbose : be extra verbose -quiet : suppress compiler
output -help : display this help message -version : display
version information</p>

<p>Execute the jaxb-xjc.jar JAR File</p>

<p>If all else fails, you should be able to execute the
jaxb-xjc.jar file:</p>

<p>For Solaris/Linux: % java -jar
$JAXB_HOME/lib/jaxb-xjc.jar -help</p>

<p>For Windows: &gt; java -jar %JAXB_HOME%libjaxb-xjc.jar
-help</p>

<p>This is equivalent of running &quot;xjc.sh&quot; or
&quot;xjc.bat&quot;, and it allows you to set the JVM
parameters.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -nv By default, the XJC binding compiler
performs strict validation of the source schema before
processing it. Use this option to disable strict schema
validation. This does not mean that the binding compiler
will not perform any validation, it simply means that it
will perform less-strict validation.</p>

<p>-extension By default, the XJC binding compiler strictly
enforces the rules outlined in the Compatibility chapter of
the JAXB Specification. Appendix E.2 defines a set of W3C
XML Schema features that are not completely supported by
JAXB v1.0. In some cases, you may be allowed to use them in
the &quot;-extension&quot; mode enabled by this switch. In
the default (strict) mode, you are also limited to using
only the binding customizations defined in the specifica-
tion. By using the &quot;-extension&quot; switch, you will
be allowed to use the JAXB Vendor Extensions.</p>

<p>-b &lt;file&gt; Specify one or more external binding
files to process. (Each binding file must have its own
&quot;-b&quot; switch.) The syntax of the external binding
files is extremely flexible. You may have a sin- gle binding
file that contains customizations for multiple schemas or
you can break the customizations into multiple bind- ings
files:</p>

<p>xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b
bindings123.xjb xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b
bindings1.xjb -b bind- ings2.xjb -b bindings3.xjb In
addition, the ordering of the schema files and binding files
on the command line does not matter.</p>

<p>-d &lt;dir&gt; By default, the XJC binding compiler will
generate the Java con- tent classes in the current
directory. Use this option to specify an alternate output
directory. The output directory must already exist, the XJC
binding compiler will not create it for you.</p>

<p>-p &lt;pkg&gt; Specifying a target package via this
command-line option over- rides any binding customization
for package name and the default package name algorithm
defined in the specification.</p>

<p>-httpproxy &lt;proxy&gt; Specify the HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
The format is [user[:pass- word]@]proxyHost[:proxyPort]. The
old -host and -port are still supported by the RI for
backwards compatibility, but they have been deprecated. Note
that the password specified with this option is an argument
that is visible to other users who use the top command, for
example. For greater security, use -httpproxy- file,
below.</p>

<p>-httpproxyfile &lt;file&gt; Specify the HTTP/HTTPS proxy
using a file. Same format as above, but the password
specified in the file is not visible to other users.</p>

<p>-classpath &lt;arg&gt; Specify where to find client
application class files used by the &lt;jxb:javaType&gt; and
&lt;xjc:superClass&gt; customizations.</p>

<p>-catalog &lt;file&gt; Specify catalog files to resolve
external entity references. Sup- ports TR9401, XCatalog, and
OASIS XML Catalog format. Please read the XML Entity and URI
Resolvers document or the catalog-resolver sample
application.</p>

<p>-readOnly By default, the XJC binding compiler does not
write-protect the Java source files it generates. Use this
option to force the XJC binding compiler to mark the
generated Java sources read-only.</p>

<p>-npa Supress the generation of package level annotations
into **/pack- age-info.java. Using this switch causes the
generated code to internalize those annotations into the
other generated classes.</p>

<p>-xmlschema treat input schemas as W3C XML Schema
(default). If you do not specify this switch, your input
schemas will be treated as W3C XML Schema.</p>

<p>-relaxng Treat input schemas as RELAX NG (experimental,
unsupported). Sup- port for RELAX NG schemas is provided as
a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-relaxng-compact Treat input schemas as RELAX NG compact
syntax(experimental, unsupported). Support for RELAX NG
schemas is provided as a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-dtd Treat input schemas as XML DTD (experimental,
unsupported). Sup- port for RELAX NG schemas is provided as
a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-wsdl Treat input as WSDL and compile schemas inside it
(experimen- tal,unsupported).</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress compiler output, such as progress
information and warn- ings..</p>

<p>-verbose Be extra verbose, such as printing
informational messages or dis- playing stack traces upon
some errors..</p>

<p>-help Display a brief summary of the compiler
switches.</p>

<p>-version Display the compiler version information.</p>

<p>&lt;schema file/URL/dir&gt; Specify one or more schema
files to compile. If you specify a directory, then xjc will
scan it for all schema files and compile them.</p>

<p>Summary of Deprecated and Removed Command Line Options
-host &amp; -port These options have been deprecated and
replaced with the -httpproxy option. For backwards
compatibility, we will con- tinue to support these options,
but they will no longer be documented and may be removed
from future releases.</p>

<p>-use-runtime Since the JAXB 2.0 specification has
defined a portable run- time, it is no longer necessary for
the JAXB RI to generate **/impl/runtime packages. Therefore,
this switch is obsolete and has been removed.</p>

<p>-source The -source compatibility switch was introduced
in the first JAXB 2.0 Early Access release. We have decided
to remove this switch from future releases of JAXB 2.0. If
you need to gener- ate 1.0.x code, please use an
installation of the 1.0.x code- base.</p>

<p>-Xlocator &amp; -Xsync-methods These switches have been
disabled for now. We plan on releas- ing this functionality
as a separate download in the future.</p>

<p>Compiler Restrictions In general, it is safest to
compile all related schemas as a single unit with the same
binding compiler switches.</p>

<p>Please keep the following list of restrictions in mind
when running xjc. Most of these issues only apply when
compiling multiple schemas with multiple invocations of
xjc.</p>

<p>o To compile multiple schemas at the same time, keep the
following precedence rules for the target Java package name
in mind:</p>

<p>1. The &quot;-p&quot; command line option takes the
highest precedence.</p>

<p>2. &lt;jaxb:package&gt; customization</p>

<p>3. If targetNamespace is declared, apply targetNamespace
-&gt; Java package name algorithm defined in the
specification.</p>

<p>4. If no targetNamespace is declared, use a hardcoded
package named &quot;generated&quot;.</p>

<p>o It is not legal to have more than one
&lt;jaxb:schemaBindings&gt; per namespace, so it is
impossible to have two schemas in the same target namespace
compiled into different Java packages.</p>

<p>o All schemas being compiled into the same Java package
must be sub- mitted to the XJC binding compiler at the same
time - they cannot be compiled independently and work as
expected.</p>

<p>o Element substitution groups spread across multiple
schema files must be compiled at the same time.</p>
