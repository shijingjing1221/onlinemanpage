<p>SOCKETCALL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SOCKETCALL(2)</p>

<p>NAME socketcall - socket system calls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int socketcall(int call, unsigned long
*args);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION socketcall() is a common kernel entry point
for the socket system calls. call determines which socket
function to invoke. args points to a block containing the
actual arguments, which are passed through to the
appropriate call.</p>

<p>User programs should call the appropriate functions by
their usual names. Only standard library implementors and
kernel hackers need to know about socketcall().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This call is specific to Linux, and should
not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES On a few architectures, for example ia64, there is
no socketcall() sys- tem call; instead socket(2), accept(2),
bind(2), and so on really are implemented as separate system
calls.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO accept(2), bind(2), connect(2), getpeername(2),
getsockname(2), get- sockopt(2), listen(2), recv(2),
recvfrom(2), recvmsg(2), send(2), sendmsg(2), sendto(2),
setsockopt(2), shutdown(2), socket(2), socket- pair(2)</p>
