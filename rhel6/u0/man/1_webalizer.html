<p>webalizer(1) The Webalizer webalizer(1)</p>

<p>NAME webalizer - A web server log file analysis
tool.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS webalizer [ option ... ] [ log-file ]</p>

<p>webazolver [ option ... ] [ log-file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Webalizer is a web server log file
analysis program which produces usage statistics in HTML
format for viewing with a browser. The results are presented
in both columnar and graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation. Yearly, monthly, daily and hourly usage
statistics are presented, along with the ability to display
usage by site, URL, referrer, user agent (browser),
username, search strings, entry/exit pages, and country
(some information may not be available if not present in the
log file being processed).</p>

<p>The Webalizer supports CLF (common log format) log
files, as well as Combined log formats as defined by NCSA
and others, and variations of these which it attempts to
handle intelligently. In addition, the Webalizer supports
xferlog formatted (FTP) log files, squid proxy logs and W3C
extended format logs. Logs may also be compressed, via gzip
(.gz) or, if enabled at compile time, bzip2 (.bz2). If a
compressed log file is detected, it will be automatically
uncompressed while it is read. Compressed logs must have the
standard gzip extension of .gz or bzip2 extension of
.bz2.</p>

<p>webazolver is normally just a symbolic link to the
Webalizer. When run as webazolver, only DNS file
creation/updates are performed, and the program will exit
once complete. All normal options and configuration
directives are available, however many will not be used. In
addition, a DNS cache file must be specified. If the number
of DNS children pro- cesses to use are not specified, the
webazolver will default to 5.</p>

<p>This documentation applies to The Webalizer Version
2.20</p>

<p>RUNNING THE WEBALIZER The Webalizer was designed to be
run from a Unix command line prompt or as a crond(8) job.
Once executed, the general flow of the program is:</p>

<p>o A default configuration file is scanned for. A file
named webalizer.conf is searched for in the current
directory, and if found, and is owned by the invoking user,
then its configura- tion data is parsed. If the file is not
present in the current directory, the file
/etc/webalizer.conf is searched for and, if found, is used
instead.</p>

<p>o Any command line arguments given to the program are
parsed. This may include the specification of a
configuration file, which is processed at the time it is
encountered.</p>

<p>o If a log file was specified, it is opened and made
ready for processing. If no log file was given, STDIN is
used for input. If the log filename - is specified, STDIN
will be forced.</p>

<p>o If an output directory was specified, the program does
a chdir(2) to that directory in preparation for generating
out- put. If no output directory was given, the current
directory is used.</p>

<p>o If a non-zero number of DNS Children processes were
specified, they will be started, and the specified log file
will be pro- cessed, creating or updating the specified DNS
cache file.</p>

<p>o If no hostname was given, the program attempts to get
the host- name using a uname(2) system call. If that fails,
localhost is used.</p>

<p>o A history file is searched for in the current
directory (output directory) and read if found. This file
keeps totals for pre- vious months, which is used in the
main index.html HTML docu- ment. Note: The file location can
now be specified with the HistoryName configuration
option.</p>

<p>o If incremental processing was specified, a data file
is searched for and loaded if found, containing the internal
state data of the program at the end of a previous run.
Note: The file location can now be specified with the
IncrementalName configuration option.</p>

<p>o Main processing begins on the log file. If the log
spans mul- tiple months, a separate HTML document is created
for each month.</p>

<p>o After main processing, the main index.html page is
created, which has totals by month and links to each months
HTML docu- ment.</p>

<p>o A new history file is saved to disk, which includes
totals gen- erated by The Webalizer during the current
run.</p>

<p>o If incremental processing was specified, a data file
is written that contains the internal state data at the end
of this run.</p>

<p>INCREMENTAL PROCESSING The Webalizer supports
incremental run capability. Simply put, this allows
processing large log files by breaking them up into smaller
pieces, and processing these pieces instead. What this means
in real terms is that you can now rotate your log files as
often as you want, and still be able to produce monthly
usage statistics without the loss of any detail. Basically,
The Webalizer saves and restores all inter- nal data in a
file named webalizer.current. This allows the program to
start where it left off so to speak, and allows the
preservation of detail from one run to the next. The data
file is placed in the cur- rent output directory, and is a
plain ASCII text file that can be viewed with any standard
text editor. Its location and name may be changed using the
IncrementalName configuration keyword.</p>

<p>Some special precautions need to be taken when using the
incremental run capability of The Webalizer. Configuration
options should not be changed between runs, as that could
cause corruption of the internal data stored. For example,
changing the MangleAgents level will cause different
representations of user agents to be stored, producing
invalid results in the user agents section of the report. If
you need to change configuration options, do it at the end
of the month after normal processing of the previous month
and before processing the cur- rent month. You may also want
to delete the webalizer.current file as well.</p>

<p>The Webalizer also attempts to prevent data duplication
by keeping track of the timestamp of the last record
processed. This timestamp is then compared to current
records being processed, and any records that were logged
previous to that timestamp are ignored. This, in theory,
should allow you to re-process logs that have already been
processed, or process logs that contain a mix of
processed/not yet processed records, and not produce
duplication of statistics. The only time this may break is
if you have duplicate timestamps in two separate log
files... any records in the second log file that do have the
same timestamp as the last record in the previous log file
processed, will be discarded as if they had already been
processed. There are lots of ways to prevent this however,
for example, stopping the web server before rotating logs
will prevent this situation. This setup also necessitates
that you always process logs in chronological order, oth-
erwise data loss will occur as a result of the timestamp
compare.</p>

<p>REVERSE DNS LOOKUPS The Webalizer fully supports IPv4
and IPv6 DNS lookups, and maintains a cache of those lookups
to reduce processing the same addresses in sub- sequent
runs. The cache file can be created at run-time, or may be
created before running the webalizer using either the stand
alone webazolver program, or The Webalizer (DNS) Cache file
manager program wcmgr . In order to perform reverse lookups,
a DNSCache file must be specified, either on the command
line or in a configuration file. In order to create/update
the cache file at run-time, the number of DNSChildren must
also be specified, and can be anything between 1 and 100.
This specifies the number of child processes to be forked,
each of which will perform network DNS queries in order to
lookup up the addresses and update the cache. Cached entries
that are older than a specified TTL (time to live) will be
expired, and if encountered again in a log, will be looked
up at that time in order to freshen them (verify the name is
still the same and update its timestamp). The default TTL is
7 days, however may be set to anything between 1 and 100
days. Using the wcmgr program, entries may also be marked as
perma- nent , in which case they will persist (with an
infinite TTL) in the cache until manually removed. See the
file DNS.README for additional information and examples.</p>

<p>GEOLOCATION LOOKUPS The Webalizer has the ability to
perform geolocation lookups on IP addresses using either its
own internal GeoDB database, or optionally the GeoIP
database from MaxMind, Inc. (www.maxmind.com). If used,
unresolved addresses will be searched for in the database
and its coun- try of origin will be returned if found. This
actually produces more accurate Country information than DNS
lookups, since the DNS address space has additional gcTLDs
that do not necessarily map to a specific country (such as
.net and .com). It is possible to use both DNS lookups and
geolocation lookups at the same time, which will cause any
addresses that could not be resolved using DNS lookups to
then be looked up in the database, greatly reducing the
number of Unknown/Unre- solved entries in the generated
reports. The native GeoDB geolocation database provided by
The Webalizer fully supports both IPv4 and IPv6 lookups, is
updated regularly and is the preferred geolocation method
for use with The Webalizer. The most current version of the
database can be obtained from our ftp site
(ftp://ftp.mrunix.net/).</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The Webalizer supports many
different configuration options that will alter the way the
program behaves and generates output. Most of these can be
specified on the command line, while some can only be
specified in a configuration file. The command line options
are listed below, with references to the corresponding
configuration file keywords.</p>

<p>General Options</p>

<p>-h Display all available command line options and exit
program.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. Will cause the program to output
informational and Debug messages at run-time.</p>

<p>-V Display the program version and exit. Additional
program spe- cific information will be displayed if verbose
mode is also used (e.g. -vV ), which can be useful when
submitting bug reports.</p>

<p>-d Debug. Display debugging information for errors and
warnings.</p>

<p>-i IgnoreHist. Ignore history. USE WITH CAUTION. This
will cause The Webalizer to ignore any previous monthly
history file only. Incremental data (if present) is still
processed.</p>

<p>-b IgnoreState. Ignore incremental data file. USE WITH
CAUTION. This will cause The Webalizer to ignore any
existing incremen- tal data file. By ignoring the
incremental data file, all pre- vious processing for the
current month will be lost and those logs must be
re-processed.</p>

<p>-p Incremental. Preserve internal data between runs.</p>

<p>-q Quiet. Suppress informational messages. Does not
suppress warnings or errors.</p>

<p>-Q ReallyQuiet. Suppress all messages including warnings
and errors.</p>

<p>-T TimeMe. Force display of timing information at end of
process- ing.</p>

sion.</p>

<p>1 Browser name, version and machine type if
possible.</p>

<p>0 All information (left unchanged).</p>

<p>-g num GroupDomains. Automatically group sites by
domain. The group- ing level specified by num can be thought
of as the number of dots to display in the grouping. The
default value of 0 dis- ables any domain grouping.</p>

<p>-D name DNSCache. Use the DNS cache file name.</p>

<p>-N num DNSChildren. Use num DNS children processes to

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES Configuration files are standard
ASCII(7) text files that may be cre- ated or edited using
any standard editor. Blank lines and lines that begin with a
pound sign (#) are ignored. Any other lines are consid- ered
to be configuration lines, and have the form &quot;Keyword
Value&quot;, where the &acute;Keyword&acute; is one of the
currently available configuration keywords defined below,
and Value is the value to assign to that par- ticular
option. Any text found after the keyword up to the end of
the line is considered the keywords value, so you should not
include any- thing after the actual value on the line that
is not actually part of the value being assigned. The file
sample.conf provided with the dis- tribution contains lots
of useful documentation and examples as well.</p>

<p>General Configuration Keywords</p>

<p>LogFile name Use log file named name. If none specified,
STDIN will be used.</p>

<p>LogType name Specify log file type as name. Values can
be either clf, squid, ftp or w3c, with the default being
clf.</p>

<p>OutputDir dir Create output in the directory dir. If
none specified, the current directory will be used.</p>

in the main index (yearly summary) graph. Default is 12
months. Can be set to anything between 12 and 72 months (1
to 6 years).</p>

<p>VisitTimeout num Specifies the visit timeout value.
Default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes). A visit is determined
by looking at the difference in time between the current and
last request from a specific site. If the difference is
greater or equal to the timeout value, the request is
counted as a new visit. Specified in seconds.</p>

<p>IndexAlias name Use name as an additional alias for
index.*.</p>

<p>DefaultIndex ( yes | no ) Enables or disables the use of
index. as a default index name to be stripped from the end
of URLs. This does not effect any index names that may be
defined with the IndexAlias option.</p>

<p>MangleAgents num Mangle user agent names based on mangle
level num. See the -M command line switch for mangle levels
and their meaning. The default is 0, which doesnt mangle

should be stripped from the end of URLs. Values may be yes
or no, with the default being yes.</p>

<p>TrimSquidURL num Allows squid log URLs to be reduced in
granularity by truncat- ing them after num slashes (/) after
the http:// prefix. A setting of one (1) will cause all URLs
to be summarized by domain only. The default value is zero
(0), which will disable any URL modifications and leave them
exactly as found in the log file.</p>

<p>SearchEngine name variable Allows the specification of
search engines and their query strings. The name is the name
to match against the referrer string for a given search
engine. The variable is the cgi variable that the search
engine uses for queries. See the sam- ple.conf file for
example usage with common search engines.</p>

<p>SearchCaseI ( yes | no ) Determines if search strings
should be treated case insensitive or not. The default is
yes, which lowercases all search strings (treat as case
insensitive).</p>

<p>Incremental ( yes | no ) Enable Incremental mode
processing.</p>

<p>IncrementalName name Filename to use for incremental
data. Relative to output directory unless an absolute name
is given (ie: starts with / ). Defaults to
&acute;webalizer.current in the standard output
directory.</p>

<p>DNSCache name Filename to use for the DNS cache.
Relative to output direc- tory unless an absolute name is
given (ie: starts with /).</p>

no.</p>

<p>GeoDBDatabase name Allows the use of an alternate GeoDB
database name. If not specified, the default database will
be used.</p>

<p>GeoIP ( yes | no ) Allows GeoIP (by MaxMind Inc.)
geolocation services to be enabled or disabled. Default is
no . If native GeoDB geolo- cation services are also
enabled, then this option will have no effect (and the
native GeoDB services will be used).</p>

<p>GeoIPDatabase name Allows the use of an alternate GeoIP
database name. If not specified, the default database will
be used.</p>
