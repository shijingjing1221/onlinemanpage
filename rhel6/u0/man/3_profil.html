<p>NAME profil - execution time profile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int profil(unsigned short *buf, size_t bufsiz, size_t
offset, unsigned int scale);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>profil(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp;
_XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This routine provides a means to find out in
what areas your program spends most of its time. The
argument buf points to bufsiz bytes of core. Every virtual
10 milliseconds, the users program counter (PC) is examined:
offset is subtracted and the result is multiplied by scale
and divided by 65536. If the resulting value is less than
bufsiz, then the corresponding entry in buf is incremented.
If buf is NULL, profil- ing is disabled.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Zero is always returned.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Similar to a call in SVr4 (but not
POSIX.1-2001).</p>

<p>BUGS profil() cannot be used on a program that also uses
ITIMER_PROF inter- val timers (see setitimer(2)).</p>

<p>True kernel profiling provides more accurate results.
Libc 4.4 con- tained a kernel patch providing a system call
profil.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gprof(1), setitimer(2), sigaction(2),
signal(2)</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
