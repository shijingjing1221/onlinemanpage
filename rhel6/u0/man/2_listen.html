<p>LISTEN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual LISTEN(2)</p>

<p>NAME listen - listen for connections on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; /* See NOTES */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION listen() marks the socket referred to by
sockfd as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will
be used to accept incoming connection requests using
accept(2).</p>

<p>The sockfd argument is a file descriptor that refers to
a socket of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.</p>

<p>The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which
the queue of pending connections for sockfd may grow. If a
connection request arrives when the queue is full, the
client may receive an error with an indication of
ECONNREFUSED or, if the underlying protocol supports
retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a later
reattempt at connection succeeds.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EADDRINUSE Another socket is already listening on
the same port.</p>

<p>EBADF The argument sockfd is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The argument sockfd is not a socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket is not of a type that supports the
listen() opera- tion.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001. The listen()
function call first appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>NOTES To accept connections, the following steps are
performed:</p>

<p>1. A socket is created with socket(2).</p>

<p>2. The socket is bound to a local address using bind(2),
so that other sockets may be connect(2)ed to it.</p>

<p>3. A willingness to accept incoming connections and a
queue limit for incoming connections are specified with
listen().</p>

<p>4. Connections are accepted with accept(2).</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on
Linux. However, some historical (BSD) implementations
required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.</p>

<p>The behavior of the backlog argument on TCP sockets
changed with Linux 2.2. Now it specifies the queue length
for completely established sockets waiting to be accepted,
instead of the number of incomplete connection requests. The
maximum length of the queue for incomplete sockets can be
set using /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog. When
syncookies are enabled there is no logical maximum length
and this set- ting is ignored. See tcp(7) for more
information.</p>

<p>If the backlog argument is greater than the value in
/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is silently truncated
to that value; the default value in this file is 128. In
kernels before 2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value,
SOMAXCONN, with the value 128.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See bind(2).</p>
