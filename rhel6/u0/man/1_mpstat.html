<p>NAME mpstat - Report processors related statistics.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mpstat [ -A ] [ -I { SUM | CPU | ALL } ] [ -u ]
[ -P { cpu [,...] | ALL } ] [ -V ] [ interval [ count ]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mpstat command writes to standard output
activities for each avail- able processor, processor 0 being
the first one. Global average activ- ities among all
processors are also reported. The mpstat command can be used
both on SMP and UP machines, but in the latter, only global
average activities will be printed. If no activity has been
selected, then the default report is the CPU utilization
report.</p>

<p>The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in
seconds between each report. A value of 0 (or no parameters
at all) indicates that processors statistics are to be
reported for the time since system startup (boot). The count
parameter can be specified in conjunction with the interval
parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of count
determines the number of reports generated at interval
seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified
without the count parame- ter, the mpstat command generates
reports continuously.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A This option is equivalent to specifying -I
ALL -u -P ALL</p>

<p>-I { SUM | CPU | ALL } Report interrupts statistics.</p>

<p>With the SUM keyword, the mpstat command reports the
total num- ber of interrupts per processor. The following
values are dis- played:</p>

<p>CPU Processor number. The keyword all indicates that
statis- tics are calculated as averages among all
processors.</p>

<p>intr/s Show the total number of interrupts received per
second by the CPU or CPUs.</p>

<p>With the CPU keyword, the number of each individual
interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is
displayed.</p>

<p>The ALL keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
keywords above and therefore all the interrupts statistics
are displayed.</p>

<p>-P { cpu [,...] | ALL } Indicate the processor number
for which statistics are to be reported. cpu is the
processor number. Note that processor 0 is the first
processor. The ALL keyword indicates that statistics are to
be reported for all processors.</p>

<p>-u Report CPU utilization. The following values are
displayed:</p>

<p>CPU Processor number. The keyword all indicates that
statis- tics are calculated as averages among all
processors.</p>

<p>%usr Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the user level
(application).</p>

<p>%nice Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the user level with nice
priority.</p>

<p>%sys Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note
that this does not include time spent servicing hardware and
software interrupts.</p>

<p>%iowait Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk
I/O request.</p>

<p>%irq Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
CPUs to service hardware interrupts.</p>

<p>%soft Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
CPUs to service software interrupts.</p>

<p>%steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary
wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was
servic- ing another virtual processor.</p>

<p>%guest Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
CPUs to run a virtual processor.</p>

<p>%idle Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk
I/O request.</p>

<p>Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any
activ- ity at all is a disabled (offline) processor.</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The mpstat command takes into account the
following environment vari- able:</p>

<p>S_TIME_FORMAT If this variable exists and its value is
ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing
the date in the report header. The mpstat command will use
the ISO 8601 format (YYYY- MM-DD) instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES mpstat 2 5 Display five reports of global
statistics among all processors at two second intervals.</p>

<p>mpstat -P ALL 2 5 Display five reports of statistics for
all processors at two second intervals.</p>

<p>BUGS /proc filesystem must be mounted for the mpstat
command to work.</p>

<p>Only a few activities are given by the Linux kernel for
each processor.</p>

<p>FILES /proc contains various files with system
statistics.</p>
