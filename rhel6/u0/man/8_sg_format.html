<p>SG_FORMAT(8) SG3_UTILS SG_FORMAT(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_format - format or resize a SCSI disk (perhaps
change its block size)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_format [--cmplst=0|1] [--count=COUNT]
[--dcrt] [--early] [--fmt- pinfo=FPI] [--format] [--help]
[--long] [--pfu=PFU] [--pie=PIE] [--pinfo] [--resize]
[--rto_req] [--security] [--six] [--size=SIZE] [--verbose]
[--version] [--wait] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Not all SCSI direct access devices need to
be formatted and some have vendor specific formatting
procedures. SCSI disks with rotating media are probably the
largest group that do support a standard format operation.
They are typically factory formatted to a block size of 512
bytes with the largest number of blocks that the
manufacturer recom- mends. The manufacturers recommendation
typically leaves aside a cer- tain number of tracks, spread
across the media, for reassignment of logical block
addresses during the life of the disk.</p>

<p>This utility can format modern SCSI disks and
potentially change their block size (if permitted) and the
block count (i.e. number of accessi- ble blocks on the media
also known as &quot;resizing&quot;). Resizing a disk to less
than the manufacturers recommended block count is sometimes
called &quot;short stroking&quot; (see NOTES section).
Resizing the block count while not changing the block size
may not require a format operation. The SBC-2 standard (see
www.t10.org) has obsoleted the &quot;format device&quot;
mode page. Many of the low level details found in that mode
page are now left up to the discretion of the
manufacturer.</p>

<p>When this utility is used without options (apart from a
DEVICE) it prints out the existing block size and block
count derived from two sources. These two sources are a
block descriptor in the response to a MODE SENSE command and
the response to a READ CAPACITY command. The reason for this
double check is to detect a &quot;format corrupt&quot; state
(see NOTES section). This usage will not modify the
disk.</p>

<p>When this utility is used with the &quot;--format&quot;
(or &quot;-F&quot;) option it will attempt to format the
given DEVICE. There is a 10 second pause during which time
the user is invited (twice 5 seconds apart) to abort sg_for-
mat. This occurs just prior the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command
being issued. See the NOTES section for more
information.</p>

<p>Recent SBC-3 drafts add several &quot;protection
types&quot; to the &quot;protection information&quot;
introduced in the SBC-2 standard. See the &quot;protection
information&quot; section (section 4.18 in draft SBC-3 rev
18). 8 bytes of protection information are added to each
block (a 2 byte &quot;logical block guard&quot; (CRC), a 2
byte &quot;logical block application guard&quot;, and a 4
byte &quot;logical block reference tag&quot;). A device that
supports protection information sets the &quot;PROTECT&quot;
bit in its standard INQUIRY response. The
&quot;FMTPINFO&quot; field in in the FORMAT UNIT command cdb
plus the &quot;Pro- tection Field Usage&quot; in the
parameter header are associated with pro- tection
information and can be set by this utility.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The options are arranged in
alphabetical order based on the long option name.</p>

<p>-C, --cmplst=0 | 1 sets the CMPLST (&quot;complete
list&quot;) bit in the FORMAT UNIT cdb to 0 or 1. The
default is 1 in which case the existing GLIST (grown list)
is ignored. If the value is 0 then the existing GLIST is
taken into account. See the LISTS section below. Active when
the --format option is given. In most cases this bit should
be left set; some MO disk drives need this bit cleared. The
SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) standard (prior draft:
sat-r09) requires this bit to be cleared.</p>

<p>-c, --count=COUNT where COUNT is the number of blocks to
be formatted or media to be resized to. Can be used with
either --format or --resize. With --format this option need
not be given in which case it is assumed to be zero. With
--format the interpretation of COUNT is: (COUNT &gt; 0) :
only format the first COUNT blocks and READ CAPACITY will
report COUNT blocks after format (COUNT = 0) and block size
unchanged : use existing block count (COUNT = 0) and block
size changed : recommended maximum block count for new block
size (COUNT = -1) : use recommended maximum block count
(COUNT &lt; -1) : illegal With --resize this option must be
given and COUNT has this interpretation: (COUNT &gt; 0) :
after resize READ CAPACITY will report COUNT blocks (COUNT =
0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report 0 blocks (COUNT
= -1) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report its maximum
number of blocks (COUNT &lt; -1) : illegal In both cases if
the given COUNT exceeds the maximum number of blocks (for
the block size) then the disk reports an error. See NOTES
section below.</p>

<p>-D, --dcrt this option sets the DCRT bit in the FORMAT
UNIT commands parameter list header. It will &quot;disable
certification&quot;. Certifi- cation verifies that blocks
are usable during the format pro- cess. Using this option
may speed the format. The default action of this utility
(i.e. when this option is not given) is to clear the DCRT
bit thereby requesting &quot;media certification&quot;. When
the DCRT bit is set, the FOV bit must also be set hence
sg_format does that.</p>

<p>-e, --early this option is active when --format is
given. The default action of this utility is to poll the
disk every 30 seconds to deter- mine the progress of the
format operation until it is finished. When this option is
given this utility will exit &quot;early&quot; as soon as
the format has commenced. Then the user can monitor the
progress of the ongoing format operation with other
utilities (e.g. sg_turs(8) or sg_requests(8)). This option
and --wait can- not both be given.</p>

<p>-f, --fmtpinfo=FPI sets the FMTPINFO field in the FORMAT
UNIT cdb to a value between 0 and 3. The default value is 0.
The FMTPINFO field from SBC-3 revision 16 is a 2 bit field
(bits 7 and 6 of byte 1 in the cdb). Prior to that it was a
single bit field (bit 7 of byte 1 in the cdb) and there was
an accompanying bit called RTO_REQ (bit 6 of byte 1 in the
cdb). The deprecated options &quot;--pinfo&quot; and
&quot;--rto-req&quot; represent the older usage. This option
should be used in their place. This option has no action
unless --format is given.</p>

<p>-F, --format issue a SCSI FORMAT UNIT command. This will
destroy all the data held on the media. This option is
required to change the block size of a disk. The user is
given a 10 second count down to ponder the wisdom of doing
this, during which time control-C (amongst other Unix
commands) can be used to kill this process before it does
any damage. See NOTES section for implementation details and
EXAMPLES section for typical use.</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage information then
exit.</p>

<p>-l, --long the default action of this utility is to
assume 32 bit logical block addresses. With 512 byte block
size this permits almost 2 terabytes (almost 2 ** 41 bytes)
on a single disk. This option selects commands and
parameters that allow for 64 bit logical block addresses.
Specifically this option sets the &quot;longlba&quot; flag
in the MODE SENSE (10) command and uses READ CAPACITY (16)
rather than READ CAPACITY (10). This option does not set the
LONGLIST bit in the FORMAT UNIT command. The LONGLIST bit is
set as required depending other parameters (e.g. when
--pie=PIE is greater than zero).</p>

<p>-P, --pfu=PFU sets the &quot;Protection Field
Usage&quot; field in the parameter block associated with a
FORMAT UNIT command to PFU. The default value is 0, the only
other defined value currently is 1. Used together with
--fmtpinfo=FPI to specify the &quot;protection type&quot; to
format the disk to (see SBC-3).</p>

<p>-p, --pinfo The option is deprecated, use the
--fmtpinfo=FPI option instead. If used, then it sets bit 7
of byte 1 in the FORMAT UNIT cdb. Has no action unless
--format is given.</p>

<p>-q, --pie=PIE sets the &quot;Protection Interval
Exponent&quot; field in the parameter block associated with
a FORMAT UNIT command to PIE. The default value is 0. This
field first appeared in SBC-3 revision 18. Has no action
unless --format is given.</p>

<p>-r, --resize rather than format the disk, it can be
resized. This means changing the number of blocks on the
device reported by the READ CAPACITY command. This option
should be used with the --count=COUNT option. The contents
of all logical blocks on the media remain unchanged when
this option is used. This means that any resize operation
can be reversed. This option cannot be used together with
either --format or a --size=SIZE whose argument is different
to the existing block size.</p>

<p>-R, --rto_req The option is deprecated, use the
--fmtpinfo=FPI option instead. If used, then it sets bit 6
of byte 1 in the FORMAT UNIT cdb. Has no action unless
--format is given.</p>

<p>-S, --security sets the &quot;Security
Initialization&quot; (SI) bit in the FORMAT UNIT commands
initialization pattern descriptor within the parameter list.
According to SBC-3 the default initialization pattern
&quot;shall be written using a security erasure write
technique&quot;. The SI bit is found in SBC (1998) and SBC-2
(2005) so vendors should support it. SATA and parallel ATA
disks have a separate command called SECURITY ERASE UNIT to
perform this action. Recent ver- sions of the hdparm utility
can execute that ATA command.</p>

<p>-6, --six Use 6 byte variants of MODE SENSE and MODE
SELECT. The default action is to use the 10 byte variants.
Some MO drives need this option set when doing a format.</p>

<p>-s, --size=SIZE where SIZE is the block size (i.e.
number of bytes in each block) to format the device to. The
default value is whatever is currently reported by the block
descriptor in a MODE SENSE command. This option is only
active when the --format option is also given. If the block
size given by this option is different from the current
value then a MODE SELECT command is used to change it prior
to the FORMAT UNIT command being started (as recommended in
the draft standard). Recent SCSI disks usually have 512 byte
sectors by default and allow up to 16 bytes extra in a
sector (i.e. 528 byte sectors). If the given size in unac-
ceptable to the disk, most likely an &quot;Invalid field in
parameter list&quot; message will appear in sense data
(requires the use of -v to decode sense data).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output). &quot;-vvv&quot; gives the maximum debug
output.</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>-w, --wait this option only has an effect when used
together with the --format option. The default format action
is to set the &quot;IMMED&quot; bit in the FORMAT UNIT
command s (short) parameter header. If this option (i.e.
--wait) is given then the &quot;IMMED&quot; bit is not set.
If --wait is given the FORMAT UNIT command waits until the
format operation completes before returning its response.
This can be several hours on large disks. This utility sets
a four hour timeout on such a FORMAT UNIT command.</p>

<p>LISTS The SBC-3 draft (revision 18) defines PLIST,
CLIST, DLIST and GLIST in section 4.10 on &quot;Medium
defects&quot;. Briefly, the PLIST is the &quot;primary&quot;
list of manufacturer detected defects, the CLIST
(&quot;certification&quot; list) contains those detected
during the format operation, the DLIST is a list of defects
that can be given to the format operation. The GLIST is the
grown list which starts in the format process as CLIST+DLIST
and can &quot;grow&quot; later due to automatic reallocation
(see the ARRE and AWRE bits in the read-write error recovery
mode page (see sdparm(8))) and use of the SCSI REASSIGN
BLOCKS command (see sg_reassign(8)).</p>

<p>The CMPLST bit (controlled by the --cmplst=0|1 option)
determines whether the existing GLIST, when the format
operation is invoked, is taken into account. The sg_format
utility sets the FOV bit to zero which causes DPRY=0, so the
PLIST is taken into account, and DCRT=0, so the CLIST is
generated and used during the format process.</p>

<p>The sg_format utility does not permit a user to provide
a defect list (i.e. DLIST).</p>

<p>NOTES The SBC-2 standard states that the REQUEST SENSE
command should be used for obtaining a progress indication
when the format command is under- way. However, tests on a
selection of recent disks shows that TEST UNIT READY
commands yield progress indications (but not REQUEST SENSE
commands). So the current version of this utility uses TEST
UNIT READY commands to poll the disk to find out the
progress of the format. A new option may be required to
handle this when disks catch up.</p>

<p>When the --format option is given without the --wait
option then the SCSI FORMAT UNIT command is issued with the
IMMED bit set which causes the SCSI command to return after
it has started the format operation. The --early option will
cause sg_format to exit at that point. Otherwise the DEVICE
is polled every 30 seconds with TEST UNIT READY commands
until it reports an &quot;all clear&quot; (i.e. the format
operation has completed). Normally these polling commands
will result in a progress indicator (expressed as a
percentage) being output to the screen. If the user gets
bored watching the progress report then sg_format process
can be terminated (e.g. with control-C) without affecting
the format operation which continues. However a bus or
device reset (or a power cycle) will probably cause the
device to become &quot;format corrupt&quot;.</p>

<p>When the --format and --wait options are both given then
this utility may take a long time to return. In this case
care should be taken not to send any other SCSI commands to
the disk as it may not respond leav- ing those commands
queued behind the active format command. This may cause a
timeout in the OS driver (in a lot shorter period than 4
hours applicable to some format operations). This may result
in the OS reset- ting the disk leaving the format operation
incomplete. This may leave the disk in a &quot;format
corrupt&quot; state requiring another format to remedy the
situation.</p>

<p>When the block size (i.e. the number of bytes in each
block) is changed on a disk two SCSI commands must be sent:
a MODE SELECT to change the block size followed by a FORMAT
command. If the MODE SELECT command succeeds and the FORMAT
fails then the disk may be in a state that the draft
standard calls &quot;format corrupt&quot;. A block
descriptor in a subse- quent MODE SENSE will report the
requested new block size while a READ CAPACITY command will
report the existing (i.e. different) block size.
Alternatively the READ CAPACITY command may fail, reporting
the device is not ready, potentially requiring a format. The
solution to this sit- uation is to do a format again (and
this time the new block size does not have to be given) or
change the block size back to the original size.</p>

<p>The SBC-2 standard states that the block count can be
set back to the manufacturer s maximum recommended value in
a format or resize opera- tion. This can be done by placing
an address of 0xffffffff (or the 64 bit equivalent) in the
appropriate block descriptor field to a MODE SELECT command.
In signed (two s complement) arithmetic that value cor-
responds to -1. So a --count=-1 causes the block count to be
set back to the manufacturers maximum recommended value. To
see exactly which SCSI commands are being executed and
parameters passed add &quot;-vvv&quot; to the sg_format
command line.</p>

<p>Short stroking is a technique to trade off capacity for
performance. Disk performance is usually highest on the
outer tracks (i.e. lower logical block addresses) so by
resizing or reformatting a disk to a smaller capacity,
average performance will usually be increased.</p>

<p>Other utilities may be useful in finding information
associated with formatting. These include sg_inq(8) to fetch
standard INQUIRY informa- tion (e.g. the PROTECT bit) and to
fetch the extended INQUIRY VPD page (e.g. RTO and GRD_CHK
bits). The sdparm(8) utility can be used to access and
potentially change the now obsolete format mode page.</p>

<p>scsiformat is another utility available for formatting
SCSI disks with linux. It dates from 1997 (most recent
update) and may be useful for disks whose firmware is of
that vintage.</p>

<p>The COUNT numeric argument may include a multiplicative
suffix or be given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC
ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the first example below simply find out the
existing block count and size derived from two sources: a
block descriptor in a MODE SELECT com- mand response and
from the response of a READ CAPACITY commands. No changes
are made:</p>

<p>sg_format /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Now a simple format, leaving the block count and size as
they were pre- viously. The FORMAT UNIT command is executed
in IMMED mode and the device is polled every 30 seconds to
print out a progress indication:</p>

<p>sg_format --format /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Now the same format, but waiting (passively) until the
format operation is complete:</p>

<p>sg_format --format --wait /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Next is a format in which the block size is changed to
520 bytes and the block count is set to the manufacturers
maximum value (for that block size). Note, not all disks
support changing the block size:</p>

<p>sg_format --format --size=520 /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Now a resize operation so that only the first 0x10000
(65536) blocks on a disk are accessible. The remaining
blocks remain unaltered.</p>

<p>sg_format --resize --count=0x10000 /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Now resize the disk back to its normal (maximum) block
count:</p>

<p>sg_format --resize --count=-1 /dev/sdm</p>

<p>Format with type 1 protection:</p>

<p>sg_format --format --fmtpinfo=3 --pfu /dev/sdm</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_format is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page. Unless
the --wait option is given, the exit status may not reflect
the success of otherwise of the format. Using sg_turs(8) and
sg_readcap(8) after the format operation may be wise.</p>
