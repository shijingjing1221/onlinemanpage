<p>console(n) Tk Built-In Commands console(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME console - Control the console on systems without a
real console</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS console subcommand ?arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The console window is a replacement for a
real console to allow input and output on the standard I/O
channels on platforms that do not have a real console. It is
implemented as a separate interpreter with the Tk toolkit
loaded, and control over this interpreter is given through
the console command. The behaviour of the console window is
defined mainly through the contents of the console.tcl file
in the Tk library. Except for TkAqua, this command is not
available when Tk is loaded into a tclsh interpreter with
package require Tk , as a conventional terminal is expected
to be present in that case. In TkAqua, this command is ony
available when stdin is /dev/null (as is the case e.g. when
the appli- cation embedding Tk is started from the Mac OS X
Finder).</p>

<p>console eval script Evaluate the script argument as a
Tcl script in the console interpreter. The normal
interpreter is accessed through the consoleinterp command in
the console interpreter.</p>

<p>console hide Hide the console window from view.
Precisely equivalent to withdrawing the . window in the
console interpreter.</p>

<p>console show Display the console window. Precisely
equivalent to deiconify- ing the . window in the console
interpreter.</p>

<p>console title ?string? Query or modify the title of the
console window. If string is not specified, queries the
title of the console window, and sets the title of the
console window to string otherwise. Precisely equivalent to
using the wm title command in the console inter- preter.</p>

<p>ACCESS TO THE MAIN INTERPRETER The consoleinterp command
in the console interpreter allows scripts to be evaluated in
the main interpreter. It supports two subcommands: eval and
record.</p>

<p>consoleinterp eval script Evaluates script as a Tcl
script at the global level in the main interpreter.</p>

<p>consoleinterp record script Records and evaluates script
as a Tcl script at the global level in the main interpreter
as if script had been typed in at the console.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL TRAP CALLS There are several additional
commands in the console interpreter that are called in
response to activity in the main interpreter. These are
documented here for completeness only; they form part of the
internal implementation of the console and are likely to
change or be modified without warning.</p>

<p>Output to the console from the main interpreter via the
stdout and stderr channels is handled by invoking the
tk::ConsoleOutput command in the console interpreter with
two arguments. The first argument is the name of the channel
being written to, and the second argument is the string
being written to the channel (after encoding and end-of-line
translation processing has been performed.)</p>

<p>When the . window of the main interpreter is destroyed,
the tk::Con- soleExit command in the console interpreter is
called (assuming the console interpreter has not already
been deleted itself, that is.)</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS The default script creates a console
window (implemented using a text widget) that has the
following behaviour:</p>

<p>[1] Pressing the tab key inserts a TAB character (as
defined by the Tcl escape.)</p>

<p>[2] Pressing the return key causes the current line (if
complete by the rules of info complete) to be passed to the
main interpreter for evaluation.</p>

<p>[3] Pressing the delete key deletes the selected text
(if any text is selected) or the character to the right of
the cursor (if not at the end of the line.)</p>

<p>[4] Pressing the backspace key deletes the selected text
(if any text is selected) or the character to the left of
the cursor (of not at the start of the line.)</p>

<p>[5] Pressing either Control+A or the home key causes the
cursor to go to the start of the line (but after the prompt,
if a prompt is present on the line.)</p>

<p>[6] Pressing either Control+E or the end key causes the
cursor to go to the end of the line.</p>

<p>[7] Pressing either Control+P or the up key causes the
previous entry in the command history to be selected.</p>

<p>[8] Pressing either Control+N or the down key causes the
next entry in the command history to be selected.</p>

<p>[9] Pressing either Control+B or the left key causes the
cursor to move one character backward as long as the cursor
is not at the prompt.</p>

<p>[10] Pressing either Control+F or the right key causes
the cursor to move one character forward.</p>

<p>[11] Pressing F9 rebuilds the console window by
destroying all its children and reloading the Tcl script
that defined the consoles behaviour.</p>

<p>Most other behaviour is the same as a conventional text
widget except for the way that the &lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt; event
is handled identically to the &lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt;
event.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Not all platforms have the console command, so
debugging code often has the following code fragment in it
so output produced by puts can be seen while during
development: catch {console show}</p>
