<p>ACL_SET_FILE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_SET_FILE(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_set_file - set an ACL by filename</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_set_file(const char *path_p, acl_type_t type,
acl_t acl);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_set_file() function associates an
access ACL with a file or directory, or associates a default
ACL with a directory. The pathname for the file or directory
is pointed to by the argument path_p.</p>

<p>The effective user ID of the process must match the
owner of the file or directory or the process must have the
CAP_FOWNER capability for the request to succeed.</p>

<p>The value of the argument type is used to indicate
whether the access ACL or the default ACL associated with
path_p is being set. If the type parameter is
ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the access ACL of path_p shall be set. If
the type parameter is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, the default ACL of
path_p shall be set. If the argument type specifies a type
of ACL that cannot be asso- ciated with path_p, then the
function fails.</p>

<p>The acl parameter must reference a valid ACL according
to the rules described on the acl_valid(3) manual page if
the type parameter is ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, and must either
reference a valid ACL or an ACL with zero ACL entries if the
type parameter is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT. If the acl parameter
references an empty ACL, then the acl_set_file() function
removes any default ACL associated with the directory
referred to by the path_p parameter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The acl_set_file() function returns the
value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned
and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_set_file() function returns -1 and sets errno to the
corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix or the object exists and the process does
not have appropriate access rights.</p>

<p>Argument type specifies a type of ACL that cannot be
associated with path_p.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl does not point to a valid
ACL.</p>

<p>The ACL has more entries than the file referred to by
path_p can obtain.</p>

<p>The type parameter is not ACL_TYPE_ACCESS or
ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>The type parameter is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, but the file
referred to by path_p is not a directory.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of the argument path_p is too
long.</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named object does not exist or the argument
path_p points to an empty string.</p>

<p>[ENOSPC] The directory or file system that would contain
the new ACL cannot be extended or the file system is out of
file allocation resources.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file identified by path_p cannot be
associated with the ACL because the file system on which the
file is located does not support this.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The process does not have appropriate privilege
to perform the operation to set the ACL.</p>

<p>[EROFS] This function requires modification of a file
system which is currently read-only.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>

<p>The behavior of acl_set_file() when the acl parameter
refers to an empty ACL and the type parameter is
ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT is an extension in the Linux
implementation, in order that all values returned by
acl_get_file() can be passed to acl_set_file(). The POSIX.1e
function for removing a default ACL is
acl_delete_def_file().</p>
