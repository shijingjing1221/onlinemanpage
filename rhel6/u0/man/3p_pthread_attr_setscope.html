<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCOPE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCOPE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_getscope, pthread_attr_setscope - get
and set the con- tentionscope attribute (REALTIME
THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_getscope(const pthread_attr_t *restrict
attr, int *restrict contentionscope); int
pthread_attr_setscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int
contentionscope);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_getscope() and
pthread_attr_setscope() functions, respectively, shall get
and set the contentionscope attribute in the attr
object.</p>

<p>The contentionscope attribute may have the values
PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, signifying system scheduling
contention scope, or PTHREAD_SCOPE_PRO- CESS, signifying
process scheduling contention scope. The symbols
PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM and PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS are defined
in the &lt;pthread.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_attr_getscope()
and pthread_attr_setscope() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_attr_setscope() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of contentionscope is not valid.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP An attempt was made to set the attribute to an
unsupported value.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE After these attributes have been set,
a thread can be created with the specified attributes using
pthread_create(). Using these routines does not affect the
current running thread.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
