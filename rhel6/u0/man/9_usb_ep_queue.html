<p>USB_EP_QUEUE(9) Kernel Mode Gadget API
USB_EP_QUEUE(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_ep_queue - queues (submits) an I/O request to
an endpoint.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_ep_queue(struct usb_ep * ep, struct
usb_request * req, gfp_t gfp_flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ep the endpoint associated with the
request</p>

<p>req the request being submitted</p>

<p>gfp_flags GFP_* flags to use in case the lower level
driver couldn&acute;t pre-allocate all necessary memory with
the request.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tells the device controller to perform
the specified request through that endpoint (reading or
writing a buffer). When the request completes, including
being canceled by usb_ep_dequeue, the request&acute;s
completion routine is called to return the request to the
driver. Any endpoint (except control endpoints like ep0) may
have more than one transfer request queued; they complete in
FIFO order. Once a gadget driver submits a request, that
request may not be examined or modified until it is given
back to that driver through the completion callback.</p>

<p>Each request is turned into one or more packets. The
controller driver never merges adjacent requests into the
same packet. OUT transfers will sometimes use data
that&acute;s already buffered in the hardware. Drivers can
rely on the fact that the first byte of the request&acute;s
buffer always corresponds to the first byte of some USB
packet, for both IN and OUT transfers.</p>

<p>Bulk endpoints can queue any amount of data; the
transfer is packetized automatically. The last packet will
be short if the request doesn&acute;t fill it out
completely. Zero length packets (ZLPs) should be avoided in
portable protocols since not all usb hardware can
successfully handle zero length packets. (ZLPs may be
explicitly written, and may be implicitly written if the
request &acute;zero&acute; flag is set.) Bulk endpoints may
also be used for interrupt transfers; but the reverse is not
true, and some endpoints won&acute;t support every interrupt
transfer. (Such as 768 byte packets.)</p>

<p>Interrupt-only endpoints are less functional than bulk
endpoints, for example by not supporting queueing or not
handling buffers that are larger than the endpoint&acute;s
maxpacket size. They may also treat data toggle
differently.</p>

<p>Control endpoints ... after getting a setup callback,
the driver queues one response (even if it would be zero
length). That enables the status ack, after transfering data
as specified in the response. Setup functions may return
negative error codes to generate protocol stalls. (Note that
some USB device controllers disallow protocol stall
responses in some cases.) When control responses are
deferred (the response is written after the setup callback
returns), then usb_ep_set_halt may be used on ep0 to trigger
protocol stalls. Depending on the controller, it may not be
possible to trigger a status-stage protocol stall when the
data stage is over, that is, from within the
response&acute;s completion routine.</p>

<p>For periodic endpoints, like interrupt or isochronous
ones, the usb host arranges to poll once per interval, and
the gadget driver usually will have queued some data to
transfer at that time.</p>

<p>Returns zero, or a negative error code. Endpoints that
are not enabled report errors; errors will also be reported
when the usb peripheral is disconnected.</p>
