<p>pilot-link(7) PILOT-LINK pilot-link(7)</p>

<p>NAME pilot-link - A suite of tools for communicating
with Palm handhelds, such as those made by Palm, Handspring,
Handera, TRGPro, Sony or other Palm Compatible Handheld PDA
device.</p>

<p>SECTION Pilot-link: Overview</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pilot-link suite of tools contains a
series of conduits, libraries, and language bindings for
moving information to and from your Palm device and your
desktop or server/workstation system, as well as across the
network.</p>

<p>TARGET DEVICE The /dev/pilot fallback has been removed
in v0.12. The environment variable $PILOTPORT can be set in
your shell, to save specifying the port each time. A serial
device specified on the command-line will be used regardless
of any $PILOTPORT setting. If $PILOTPORT is not set, and -p
is not supplied, all conduits in pilot-link will print the
usage information. The default connection rate is 9600 baud.
You are welcome to try higher baud rates (19200, 38400,
57600 or higher) by setting the $PILOTRATE environment
variable, but various machines have various lim- itations.
(Be careful about values higher than 115200 on older Linux
boxes if you ve been using setserial to change the
multiplier).</p>

<p>CONDUITS A complete list of conduits available from
within the pilot-link pack- age as of the date of this
manpage. If you invoke any of the conduits from pilot-link
with no command-line arguments at all, the usage sum- mary
will be printed.</p>

<p>Note that there are widespread changes in this release -
some conduits have been merged, a lot have had new options
added and some options have been renamed or removed.</p>

<p>MAILING LIST The original pilot-unix mailing list has
been taken offline, and is now being hosted and maintained
by David A. Desrosiers &lt;desrod@gnu-designs.com&gt;. The
original pilot-unix mailing list was maintained by Matthew
Cravit. Its mandate was:</p>

<p>The pilot-unix mailing list is for discussion and
&quot;idea-sharing&quot; for those interested in using your
Palm handheld with UNIX systems. This includes people who
are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the Palm
to operate with UNIX and other POSIX systems, and possibly
to develop an SDK (Software Develop- ment Kit) for the Palm
for Unix.</p>
