<p>SETREGID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETREGID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setregid - set real and effective group IDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setregid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setregid() function shall set the real
and effective group IDs of the calling process.</p>

<p>If rgid is -1, the real group ID shall not be changed;
if egid is -1, the effective group ID shall not be
changed.</p>

<p>The real and effective group IDs may be set to different
values in the same call.</p>

<p>Only a process with appropriate privileges can set the
real group ID and the effective group ID to any valid
value.</p>

<p>A non-privileged process can set either the real group
ID to the saved set-group-ID from one of the exec family of
functions, or the effective group ID to the saved
set-group-ID or the real group ID.</p>

<p>Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error, and neither of the group IDs are
changed.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setregid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the rgid or egid argument is invalid
or out-of- range.</p>

<p>EPERM The process does not have appropriate privileges
and a change other than changing the real group ID to the
saved set-group-ID, or changing the effective group ID to
the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID, was
requested.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If a set-group-ID process sets its
effective group ID to its real group ID, it can still set
its effective group ID back to the saved set- group-ID.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
