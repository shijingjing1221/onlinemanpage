<p>RRDGRAPH(1) rrdtool RRDGRAPH(1)</p>

<p>NAME rrdgraph - Round Robin Database tool grapher
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool graph|graphv filename [option ...]
[data definition ...] [data calculation ...] [variable
definition ...] [graph element ...] [print element ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The graph function of RRDtool is used to
present the data from an RRD to a human viewer. Its main
purpose is to create a nice graphical representation, but it
can also generate a numerical report.</p>

<p>OVERVIEW rrdtool graph needs data to work with, so you
must use one or more data definition statements to collect
this data. You are not limited to one database, its
perfectly legal to collect data from two or more databases
(one per statement, though).</p>

<p>If you want to display averages, maxima, percentiles,
etcetera it is best to collect them now using the variable
definition statement. Currently this makes no difference,
but in a future version of rrdtool you may want to collect
these values before consolidation.</p>

<p>The data fetched from the RRA is then consolidated so
that there is exactly one datapoint per pixel in the graph.
If you do not take care yourself, RRDtool will expand the
range slightly if necessary. Note, in that case the first
and/or last pixel may very well become unknown!</p>

<p>Sometimes data is not exactly in the format you would
like to display it. For instance, you might be collecting
bytes per second, but want to display bits per second. This
is what the data calculation command is designed for. After
consolidating the data, a copy is made and this copy is
modified using a rather powerful RPN command set.</p>

<p>When you are done fetching and processing the data, it
is time to graph it (or print it). This ends the rrdtool
graph sequence.</p>

<p>OPTIONS graphv This alternate version of graph takes the
same arguments and performs the same function. The v stands
for verbose, which describes the output returned. graphv
will return a lot of information about the graph using the
same format as rrdtool info (key = value). See the bottom of
the document for more information.</p>

<p>filename The name and path of the graph to generate. It
is recommended to end this in &quot;.png&quot;,
&quot;.svg&quot; or &quot;.eps&quot;, but RRDtool does not
enforce this.</p>

<p>filename can be &quot;-&quot; to send the image to
&quot;stdout&quot;. In this case, no other output is
generated.</p>

<p>Time range [-s|--start time] [-e|--end time] [-S|--step
seconds]</p>

<p>The start and end of the time series you would like to
display, and which RRA the data should come from. Defaults
are: 1 day ago until now, with the best possible resolution.
Start and end can be specified in several formats, see
AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION and rrdgraph_examples. By
default, rrdtool graph calculates the width of one pixel in
the time domain and tries to get data from an RRA with that
resolution. With the step option you can alter this
behaviour. If you want rrdtool graph to get data at a
one-hour resolution from the RRD, set step to 3600. Note: a
step smaller than one pixel will silently be ignored.</p>

<p>Labels [-t|--title string] [-v|--vertical-label
string]</p>

<p>A horizontal string at the top of the graph and/or a
vertically placed string at the left hand side of the
graph.</p>

<p>Right Axis [--right-axis scale:shift]
[--right-axis-label label]</p>

<p>A second axis will be drawn to the right of the graph.
It is tied to the left axis via the scale and shift
parameters. You can also define a label for the right
axis.</p>

<p>[--right-axis-format format-string]</p>

<p>By default the format of the axis lables gets determined
automatically. If you want todo this your self, use this
option with the same %lf arguments you know from the PRING
and GPRINT commands.</p>

<p>Size [-w|--width pixels] [-h|--height pixels]
[-j|--only-graph] [-D|--full-size-mode]</p>

<p>By default, the width and height of the canvas (the part
with the actual data and such). This defaults to 400 pixels
by 100 pixels.</p>

<p>If you specify the --full-size-mode option, the width
and height specify the final dimensions of the output image
and the canvas is automatically resized to fit.</p>

<p>If you specify the --only-graph option and set the
height &lt; 32 pixels you will get a tiny graph image
(thumbnail) to use as an icon for use in an overview, for
example. All labeling will be stripped off the graph.</p>

<p>Limits [-u|--upper-limit value] [-l|--lower-limit value]
[-r|--rigid]</p>

<p>By default the graph will be autoscaling so that it will
adjust the y-axis to the range of the data. You can change
this behaviour by explicitly setting the limits. The
displayed y-axis will then range at least from lower-limit
to upper-limit. Autoscaling will still permit those
boundaries to be stretched unless the rigid option is
set.</p>

<p>[-A|--alt-autoscale]</p>

<p>Sometimes the default algorithm for selecting the y-axis
scale is not satisfactory. Normally the scale is selected
from a predefined set of ranges and this fails miserably
when you need to graph something like &quot;260 + 0.001 *
sin(x)&quot;. This option calculates the minimum and maximum
y-axis from the actual minimum and maximum data values. Our
example would display slightly less than
&quot;260-0.001&quot; to slightly more than
&quot;260+0.001&quot; (this feature was contributed by Sasha
Mikheev).</p>

<p>[-J|--alt-autoscale-min]</p>

<p>Where &quot;--alt-autoscale&quot; will modify both the
absolute maximum AND minimum values, this option will only
affect the minimum value. The maximum value, if not defined
on the command line, will be 0. This option can be useful
when graphing router traffic when the WAN line uses
compression, and thus the throughput may be higher than the
WAN line speed.</p>

<p>[-M|--alt-autoscale-max]</p>

<p>Where &quot;--alt-autoscale&quot; will modify both the
absolute maximum AND minimum values, this option will only
affect the maximum value. The minimum value, if not defined
on the command line, will be 0. This option can be useful
when graphing router traffic when the WAN line uses
compression, and thus the throughput may be higher than the
WAN line speed.</p>

<p>[-N|--no-gridfit]</p>

<p>In order to avoid anti-aliasing blurring effects rrdtool
snaps points to device resolution pixels, this results in a
crisper appearance. If this is not to your liking, you can
use this switch to turn this behaviour off.</p>

<p>Gridfitting is turned off for PDF, EPS, SVG output by
default.</p>

<p>Grid X-Axis [-x|--x-grid
GTM:GST:MTM:MST:LTM:LST:LPR:LFM]</p>

<p>[-x|--x-grid none]</p>

<p>The x-axis label is quite complex to configure. If you
dont have very special needs it is probably best to rely on
the autoconfiguration to get this right. You can specify the
string &quot;none&quot; to suppress the grid and labels
altogether.</p>

<p>The grid is defined by specifying a certain amount of
time in the ?TM positions. You can choose from
&quot;SECOND&quot;, &quot;MINUTE&quot;, &quot;HOUR&quot;,
&quot;DAY&quot;, &quot;WEEK&quot;, &quot;MONTH&quot; or
&quot;YEAR&quot;. Then you define how many of these should
pass between each line or label. This pair (?TM:?ST) needs
to be specified for the base grid (G??), the major grid
(M??) and the labels (L??). For the labels you also must
define a precision in LPR and a strftime format string in
LFM. LPR defines where each label will be placed. If it is
zero, the label will be placed right under the corresponding
line (useful for hours, dates etcetera). If you specify a
number of seconds here the label is centered on this
interval (useful for Monday, January etcetera).</p>

<p>--x-grid MINUTE:10:HOUR:1:HOUR:4:0:%X</p>

<p>This places grid lines every 10 minutes, major grid
lines every hour, and labels every 4 hours. The labels are
placed under the major grid lines as they specify exactly
that time.</p>

<p>--x-grid HOUR:8:DAY:1:DAY:1:86400:%A</p>

<p>This places grid lines every 8 hours, major grid lines
and labels each day. The labels are placed exactly between
two major grid lines as they specify the complete day and
not just midnight.</p>

<p>Y-Axis [-y|--y-grid grid step:label factor]</p>

<p>[-y|--y-grid none]</p>

<p>Y-axis grid lines appear at each grid step interval.
Labels are placed every label factor lines. You can specify
&quot;-y none&quot; to suppress the grid and labels
altogether. The default for this option is to automatically
select sensible values.</p>

<p>If you have set --y-grid to none not only the labels get
suppressed, also the space reserved for the labels is
removed. You can still add space manually if you use the
--units-length command to explicitly reserve space.</p>

<p>[-Y|--alt-y-grid]</p>

<p>Place the Y grid dynamically based on the graph s Y
range. The algorithm ensures that you always have a grid,
that there are enough but not too many grid lines, and that
the grid is metric. That is the grid lines are placed every
1, 2, 5 or 10 units. This parameter will also ensure that
you get enough decimals displayed even if your graph goes
from 69.998 to 70.001. (contributed by Sasha Mikheev).</p>

<p>[-o|--logarithmic]</p>

<p>Logarithmic y-axis scaling.</p>

<p>[-X|--units-exponent value]</p>

<p>This sets the 10**exponent scaling of the y-axis values.
Normally, values will be scaled to the appropriate units (k,
M, etc.). However, you may wish to display units always in k
(Kilo, 10e3) even if the data is in the M (Mega, 10e6)
range, for instance. Value should be an integer which is a
multiple of 3 between -18 and 18 inclusively. It is the
exponent on the units you wish to use. For example, use 3 to
display the y-axis values in k (Kilo, 10e3, thousands), use
-6 to display the y-axis values in u (Micro, 10e-6,
millionths). Use a value of 0 to prevent any scaling of the
y-axis values.</p>

<p>This option is very effective at confusing the heck out
of the default rrdtool autoscaler and grid painter. If
rrdtool detects that it is not successful in labeling the
graph under the given circumstances, it will switch to the
more robust --alt-y-grid mode.</p>

<p>[-L|--units-length value]</p>

<p>How many digits should rrdtool assume the y-axis labels
to be? You may have to use this option to make enough space
once you start fideling with the y-axis labeling.</p>

<p>[--units=si]</p>

<p>With this option y-axis values on logarithmic graphs
will be scaled to the appropriate units (k, M, etc.) instead
of using exponential notation. Note that for linear graphs,
SI notation is used by default.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous [-z|--lazy]</p>

<p>Only generate the graph if the current graph is out of
date or not existent. Note, that all the calculations will
happen regardless so that the output of PRINT and graphv
will be complete regardless. Note that the behaviour of lazy
in this regard has seen several changes over time. The only
thing you can realy rely on before rrdtool 1.3.7 is that
lazy will not generate the graph when it is already there
and up to date, and also that it will output the size of the
graph.</p>

<p>[-f|--imginfo printfstr]</p>

<p>After the image has been created, the graph function
uses printf together with this format string to create
output similar to the PRINT function, only that the printf
function is supplied with the parameters filename, xsize and
ysize. In order to generate an IMG tag suitable for
including the graph into a web page, the command line would
look like this:</p>

<p>--imginfo &rsquo;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/img/%s&quot;
WIDTH=&quot;%lu&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;%lu&quot;
ALT=&quot;Demo&quot;&gt;&rsquo;</p>

<p>[-c|--color COLORTAG#rrggbb[aa]]</p>

<p>Override the default colors for the standard elements of
the graph. The COLORTAG is one of &quot;BACK&quot;
background, &quot;CANVAS&quot; for the background of the
actual graph, &quot;SHADEA&quot; for the left and top
border, &quot;SHADEB&quot; for the right and bottom border,
&quot;GRID&quot;, &quot;MGRID&quot; for the major grid,
&quot;FONT&quot; for the color of the font, &quot;AXIS&quot;
for the axis of the graph, &quot;FRAME&quot; for the line
around the color spots, and finally &quot;ARROW&quot; for
the arrow head pointing up and forward. Each color is
composed out of three hexadecimal numbers specifying its rgb
color component (00 is off, FF is maximum) of red, green and
blue. Optionally you may add another hexadecimal number
specifying the transparency (FF is solid). You may set this
option several times to alter multiple defaults.</p>

<p>A green arrow is made by: &quot;--color
ARROW#00FF00&quot;</p>

<p>[--zoom factor]</p>

<p>Zoom the graphics by the given amount. The factor must
be &gt; 0</p>

<p>[-n|--font FONTTAG:size:[font]]</p>

<p>This lets you customize which font to use for the
various text elements on the RRD graphs. &quot;DEFAULT&quot;
sets the default value for all elements, &quot;TITLE&quot;
for the title, &quot;AXIS&quot; for the axis labels,
&quot;UNIT&quot; for the vertical unit label,
&quot;LEGEND&quot; for the graph legend,
&quot;WATERMARK&quot; for the watermark on the edge of the
graph.</p>

<p>Use Times for the title: &quot;--font
TITLE:13:Times&quot;</p>

<p>If you do not give a font string you can modify just the
size of the default font: &quot;--font TITLE:13:&quot;.</p>

<p>If you specify the size 0 then you can modify just the
font without touching the size. This is especially useful
for altering the default font without resetting the default
fontsizes: &quot;--font DEFAULT:0:Courier&quot;.</p>

<p>RRDtool comes with a preset default font. You can set
the environment variable &quot;RRD_DEFAULT_FONT&quot; if you
want to change this.</p>

<p>RRDtool uses Pango for its font handling. This means you
can to use the full Pango syntax when selecting your
font:</p>

<p>The font name has the form &quot;[FAMILY-LIST]
[STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]&quot;, where FAMILY-LIST is a comma
separated list of families optionally terminated by a comma,
STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace separated list of words where
each WORD describes one of style, variant, weight, stretch,
or gravity, and SIZE is a decimal number (size in points) or
optionally followed by the unit modifier &quot;px&quot; for
absolute size. Any one of the options may be absent.</p>

<p>[-R|--font-render-mode {normal,light,mono}]</p>

<p>There are 3 font render modes:</p>

<p>normal: Full Hinting and Antialiasing (default)</p>

<p>light: Slight Hinting and Antialiasing</p>

<p>mono: Full Hinting and NO Antialiasing</p>

<p>[-B|--font-smoothing-threshold size]</p>

<p>(this gets ignored in 1.3 for now!)</p>

<p>This specifies the largest font size which will be
rendered bitmapped, that is, without any font smoothing. By
default, no text is rendered bitmapped.</p>

<p>[-P|--pango-markup]</p>

<p>All text in rrdtool is rendered using Pango. With the
--pango-markup option, all text will be processed by pango
markup. This allows to embed some simple html like markup
tags using</p>

<p>&lt;span key=&quot;value&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p>Apart from the verbose syntax, there are also the
following short tags available.</p>

<p>b Bold big Makes font relatively larger, equivalent to
&lt;span size=&quot;larger&quot;&gt; i Italic s
Strikethrough sub Subscript sup Superscript small Makes font
relatively smaller, equivalent to &lt;span
size=&quot;smaller&quot;&gt; tt Monospace font u
Underline</p>

<p>More details on
&lt;http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/pango/PangoMarkupFormat.html&gt;.</p>

<p>[-G|--graph-render-mode {normal,mono}]</p>

<p>There are 2 render modes:</p>

<p>normal: Graphs are fully Antialiased (default)</p>

<p>mono: No Antialiasing</p>

<p>[-E|--slope-mode]</p>

<p>RRDtool graphs are composed of stair case curves by
default. This is in line with the way RRDtool calculates its
data. Some people favor a more organic look for their graphs
even though it is not all that true.</p>

<p>[-a|--imgformat PNG|SVG|EPS|PDF]</p>

<p>Image format for the generated graph. For the vector
formats you can choose among the standard Postscript fonts
Courier-Bold, Courier- BoldOblique, Courier-Oblique,
Courier, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica- BoldOblique,
Helvetica-Oblique, Helvetica, Symbol, Times-Bold, Times-
BoldItalic, Times-Italic, Times-Roman, and ZapfDingbats.</p>

<p>[-i|--interlaced]</p>

<p>(this gets ignored in 1.3 for now!)</p>

<p>If images are interlaced they become visible on browsers
more quickly.</p>

<p>[-g|--no-legend]</p>

<p>Suppress generation of the legend; only render the
graph.</p>

<p>[-F|--force-rules-legend]</p>

<p>Force the generation of HRULE and VRULE legends even if
those HRULE or VRULE will not be drawn because out of graph
boundaries (mimics behaviour of pre 1.0.42 versions).</p>

<p>[-T|--tabwidth value]</p>

<p>By default the tab-width is 40 pixels, use this option
to change it.</p>

<p>[-b|--base value]</p>

<p>If you are graphing memory (and NOT network traffic)
this switch should be set to 1024 so that one Kb is 1024
byte. For traffic measurement, 1 kb/s is 1000 b/s.</p>

<p>[-W|--watermark string]</p>

<p>Adds the given string as a watermark, horizontally
centered, at the bottom of the graph.</p>

<p>Data and variables
DEF:vname=rrdfile:ds-name:CF[:step=step][:start=time][:end=time]</p>

<p>CDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p>VDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p>You need at least one DEF statement to generate
anything. The other statements are useful but optional. See
rrdgraph_data and rrdgraph_rpn for the exact format.</p>

<p>NOTE: Graph and print elements</p>

<p>You need at least one graph element to generate an image
and/or at least one print statement to generate a report.
See rrdgraph_graph for the exact format.</p>

<p>graphv Calling rrdtool with the graphv option will
return information in the rrdtool info format. On the
command line this means that all output will be in key=value
format. When used from the Perl and Ruby bindings a hash
pointer will be returned from the call.</p>

<p>When the filename - is given, the contents of the graph
itself will also be returned through this interface (hash
key image ). On the command line the output will look like
this:</p>

<p>print[0] = &quot;0.020833&quot; print[1] =
&quot;0.0440833&quot; graph_left = 51 graph_top = 22
graph_width = 400 graph_height = 100 graph_start =
1232908800 graph_end = 1232914200 image_width = 481
image_height = 154 value_min = 0.0000000000e+00 value_max =
4.0000000000e-02 image = BLOB_SIZE:8196 [... 8196 bytes of
image data ...]</p>

<p>There is more information returned than in the standard
interface. Especially the graph_* keys are new. They help
applications that want to know what is where on the
graph.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rrdgraph gives an overview of how rrdtool graph
works. rrdgraph_data describes DEF,CDEF and VDEF in detail.
rrdgraph_rpn describes the RPN language used in the ?DEF
statements. rrdgraph_graph page describes all of the graph
and print functions.</p>
