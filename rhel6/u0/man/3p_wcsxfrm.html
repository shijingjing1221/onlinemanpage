<p>WCSXFRM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSXFRM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsxfrm - wide-character string transformation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsxfrm(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsxfrm() function shall transform the
wide-character string pointed to by ws2 and place the
resulting wide-character string into the array pointed to by
ws1. The transformation shall be such that if wcscmp() is
applied to two transformed wide strings, it shall return a
value greater than, equal to, or less than 0, corresponding
to the result of wcscoll() applied to the same two original
wide-character strings. No more than n wide-character codes
shall be placed into the resulting array pointed to by ws1,
including the terminating null wide- character code. If n is
0, ws1 is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes
place between objects that overlap, the behavior is unde-
fined.</p>

<p>The wcsxfrm() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error,
an application wishing to check for error situations should
set errno to 0, then call wcsxfrm(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsxfrm() function shall return the
length of the transformed wide- character string (not
including the terminating null wide-character code). If the
value returned is n or more, the contents of the array
pointed to by ws1 are unspecified.</p>

<p>On error, the wcsxfrm() function may set errno, but no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcsxfrm() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The wide-character string pointed to by ws2
contains wide-char- acter codes outside the domain of the
collating sequence.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The transformation function is such
that two transformed wide-character strings can be ordered
by wcscmp() as appropriate to collating sequence information
in the programs locale (category LC_COLLATE ).</p>

<p>The fact that when n is 0 ws1 is permitted to be a null
pointer is use- ful to determine the size of the ws1 array
prior to making the trans- formation.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
