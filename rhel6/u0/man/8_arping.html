<p>ARPING(8) System Manager s Manual: iputils ARPING(8)</p>

<p>NAME arping - send ARP REQUEST to a neighbour host</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arping [ -AbDfhqUV] [ -c count] [ -w deadline]
[ -s source] -I interface destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ping destination on device interface by ARP
packets, using source address source.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A The same as -U, but ARP REPLY packets used
instead of ARP REQUEST.</p>

<p>-b Send only MAC level broadcasts. Normally arping
starts from sending broadcast, and switch to unicast after
reply received.</p>

<p>-c count Stop after sending count ARP REQUEST packets.
With deadline option, arping waits for count ARP REPLY
packets, until the timeout expires.</p>

<p>-D Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). See RFC2131,
4.4.1. Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies are
received</p>

<p>-f Finish after the first reply confirming that target
is alive.</p>

<p>-I interface Name of network device where to send ARP
REQUEST packets. This option is required.</p>

<p>-h Print help page and exit.</p>

<p>-q Quiet output. Nothing is displayed.</p>

<p>-s source IP source address to use in ARP packets. If
this option is absent, source address is:</p>

<p>&middot; In DAD mode (with option -D) set to
0.0.0.0.</p>

<p>&middot; In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options -U or -A)
set to desti- nation.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, it is calculated from routing
tables.</p>

<p>-U Unsolicited ARP mode to update neighbours ARP caches.
No replies are expected.</p>

<p>-V Print version of the program and exit.</p>

<p>-w deadline Specify a timeout, in seconds, before arping
exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or
received. In this case arping does not stop after count
packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or
until count probes are answered.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ping(8), clockdiff(8), tracepath(8).</p>

<p>AUTHOR arping was written by Alexey Kuznetsov
&lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;. It is now maintained by
YOSHIFUJI Hideaki &lt;yoshfuji@skbuff.net&gt;.</p>

<p>SECURITY arping requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be
executed. It is not rec- ommended to be used as set-uid
root, because it allows user to modify ARP caches of
neighbour hosts.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY arping is part of iputils package and the
latest versions are avail- able in source form at
