<p>COM_ERR(3) COM_ERR(3)</p>

<p>NAME com_err - common error display routine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;et/com_err.h&gt; void (*proc)
(const char *, long, const char *, va_list);</p>

<p>void com_err (const char *whoami, long code, const char
*format, ...);</p>

<p>proc = set_com_err_hook (proc);</p>

<p>proc = reset_com_err_hook ();</p>

<p>void initialize_XXXX_error_table ();</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Com_err displays an error message on the
standard error stream stderr (see stdio(3S)) composed of the
whoami string, which should specify the program name or some
subportion of a program, followed by an error mes- sage
generated from the code value (derived from compile_et(1)),
and a string produced using the format string and any
following arguments, in the same style as fprintf(3).</p>

<p>The behavior of com_err can be modified using
set_com_err_hook; this defines a procedure which is called
with the arguments passed to com_err, instead of the default
internal procedure which sends the for- matted text to error
output. Thus the error messages from a program can all
easily be diverted to another form of diagnostic logging,
such as syslog(3). Reset_com_err_hook may be used to restore
the behavior of com_err to its default form. Both procedures
return the previous hook value. These hook procedures must
have the declaration given for proc above in the
synopsis.</p>

<p>The initialize_XXXX_error_table routine is generated
mechanically by compile_et(1) from a source file containing
names and associated strings. Each table has a name of up to
four characters, which is used in place of the XXXX in the
name of the routine. These routines should be called before
any of the corresponding error codes are used, so that the
com_err library will recognize error codes from these tables
when they are used.</p>

<p>The com_err.h header file should be included in any
source file that uses routines from the com_err library;
executable files must be linked using _-lcom_err__ in order
to cause the com_err library to be included.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO compile_et (1), syslog (3).</p>
