<p>NAME XmTrackingEvent A Toolkit function that provides a
modal interaction</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; Widget
XmTrackingEvent( Widget widget, Cursor cursor, Boolean
confine_to, XEvent *event_return);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTrackingEvent provides a modal interface
for selection of a compo- nent. It is intended to support
context help. The function calls the XmUpdateDisplay
function. XmTrackingEvent then grabs the pointer and
discards succeeding events until BSelect is released or a
key is pressed and then released. The function then returns
the widget or gadget that contains the pointer when BSelect
is released or a key is released, and ungrabs the
pointer.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the widget ID of a widget to use as the
basis of the modal interaction. That is, the widget within
which the interaction must occur, usually a top-level
shell.</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor to be used for the pointer
during the interaction. This is a standard X cursor
name.</p>

<p>confine_to Specifies whether or not the cursor should be
confined to widget.</p>

<p>event_return Returns the ButtonRelease or KeyRelease
event that causes the function to return.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the widget or gadget that contains the
pointer when BSelect is released or a key is released. If no
widget or gadget contains the pointer, the function returns
NULL.</p>
