<p>NAME dict - Manipulate dictionaries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dict option arg ?arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Performs one of several operations on
dictionary values or variables containing dictionary values
(see the DICTIONARY VALUES section below for a description),
depending on option. The legal options (which may be
abbreviated) are:</p>

<p>dict append dictionaryVariable key ?string ...? This
appends the given string (or strings) to the value that the
given key maps to in the dictionary value contained in the
given variable, writing the resulting dictionary value back
to that variable. Non-existent keys are treated as if they
map to an empty string.</p>

<p>dict create ?key value ...? Create a new dictionary that
contains each of the key/value map- pings listed as
arguments (keys and values alternating, with each key being
followed by its associated value.)</p>

<p>dict exists dictionaryValue key ?key ...? This returns a
boolean value indicating whether the given key (or path of
keys through a set of nested dictionaries) exists in the
given dictionary value. This returns a true value exactly
when dict get on that path will succeed.</p>

<p>dict filter dictionaryValue filterType arg ?arg ...?
This takes a dictionary value and returns a new dictionary
that contains just those key/value pairs that match the
specified filter type (which may be abbreviated.) Supported
filter types are:</p>

<p>dict filter dictionaryValue key globPattern The key rule
only matches those key/value pairs whose keys match the
given pattern (in the style of string match.)</p>

<p>dict filter dictionaryValue script {keyVar valueVar}
script The script rule tests for matching by assigning the
key to the keyVar and the value to the valueVar, and then
evaluating the given script which should return a boolean
value (with the key/value pair only being included in the
result of the dict filter when a true value is returned.)
Note that the first argument after the rule selection word
is a two-element list. If the script returns with a
condition of TCL_BREAK, no further key/value pairs are
considered for inclusion in the resulting dictionary, and a
condition of TCL_CONTINUE is equivalent to a false result.
The key/value pairs are tested in the order in which the
keys were inserted into the dictionary.</p>

<p>dict filter dictionaryValue value globPattern The value
rule only matches those key/value pairs whose values match
the given pattern (in the style of string match.)</p>

<p>dict for {keyVar valueVar} dictionaryValue body This
command takes three arguments, the first a two-element list
of variable names (for the key and value respectively of
each mapping in the dictionary), the second the dictionary
value to iterate across, and the third a script to be
evaluated for each mapping with the key and value variables
set appropriately (in the manner of foreach.) The result of
the command is an empty string. If any evaluation of the
body generates a TCL_BREAK result, no further pairs from the
dictionary will be iterated over and the dict for command
will terminate successfully imme- diately. If any evaluation
of the body generates a TCL_CONTINUE result, this shall be
treated exactly like a normal TCL_OK result. The order of
iteration is the order in which the keys were inserted into
the dictionary.</p>

<p>dict get dictionaryValue ?key ...? Given a dictionary
value (first argument) and a key (second argument), this
will retrieve the value for that key. Where sev- eral keys
are supplied, the behaviour of the command shall be as if
the result of dict get $dictVal $key was passed as the first
argument to dict get with the remaining arguments as second
(and possibly subsequent) arguments. This facilitates
lookups in nested dictionaries. For example, the following
two commands are equivalent: dict get $dict foo bar spong
dict get [dict get [dict get $dict foo] bar] spong If no
keys are provided, dict would return a list containing pairs
of elements in a manner similar to array get. That is, the
first element of each pair would be the key and the second
ele- ment would be the value for that key.</p>

<p>It is an error to attempt to retrieve a value for a key
that is not present in the dictionary.</p>

<p>dict incr dictionaryVariable key ?increment? This adds
the given increment value (an integer that defaults to 1 if
not specified) to the value that the given key maps to in
the dictionary value contained in the given variable,
writing the resulting dictionary value back to that
variable. Non-exis- tent keys are treated as if they map to
0. It is an error to increment a value for an existing key
if that value is not an integer.</p>

<p>dict info dictionaryValue This returns information
(intended for display to people) about the given dictionary
though the format of this data is dependent on the
implementation of the dictionary. For dictionaries that are
implemented by hash tables, it is expected that this will
return the string produced by Tcl_HashStats, similar to
array info.</p>

<p>dict keys dictionaryValue ?globPattern? Return a list of
all keys in the given dictionary value. If a pattern is
supplied, only those keys that match it (according to the
rules of string match) will be returned. The returned keys
will be in the order that they were inserted into the
dictio- nary.</p>

<p>dict lappend dictionaryVariable key ?value ...? This
appends the given items to the list value that the given key
maps to in the dictionary value contained in the given vari-
able, writing the resulting dictionary value back to that
vari- able. Non-existent keys are treated as if they map to
an empty list, and it is legal for there to be no items to
append to the list. It is an error for the value that the
key maps to to not be representable as a list.</p>

<p>dict merge ?dictionaryValue ...? Return a dictionary
that contains the contents of each of the dictionaryValue
arguments. Where two (or more) dictionaries contain a
mapping for the same key, the resulting dictionary maps that
key to the value according to the last dictionary on the
command line containing a mapping for that key.</p>

<p>dict remove dictionaryValue ?key ...? Return a new
dictionary that is a copy of an old one passed in as first
argument except without mappings for each of the keys
listed. It is legal for there to be no keys to remove, and
it also legal for any of the keys to be removed to not be
present in the input dictionary in the first place.</p>

<p>dict replace dictionaryValue ?key value ...? Return a
new dictionary that is a copy of an old one passed in as
first argument except with some values different or some
extra key/value pairs added. It is legal for this command to
be called with no key/value pairs, but illegal for this
command to be called with a key but no value.</p>

<p>dict set dictionaryVariable key ?key ...? value This
operation takes the name of a variable containing a dictio-
nary value and places an updated dictionary value in that
vari- able containing a mapping from the given key to the
given value. When multiple keys are present, this operation
creates or updates a chain of nested dictionaries.</p>

<p>dict size dictionaryValue Return the number of key/value
mappings in the given dictionary value.</p>

<p>dict unset dictionaryVariable key ?key ...? This
operation (the companion to dict set) takes the name of a
variable containing a dictionary value and places an updated
dictionary value in that variable that does not contain a
map- ping for the given key. Where multiple keys are
present, this describes a path through nested dictionaries
to the mapping to remove. At least one key must be
specified, but the last key on the key-path need not exist.
All other components on the path must exist.</p>

<p>dict update dictionaryVariable key varName ?key varName
...? body Execute the Tcl script in body with the value for
each key (as found by reading the dictionary value in
dictionaryVariable) mapped to the variable varName. There
may be multiple key/var- Name pairs. If a key does not have
a mapping, that corresponds to an unset varName. When body
terminates, any changes made to the varNames is reflected
back to the dictionary within dictio- naryVariable (unless
dictionaryVariable itself becomes unread- able, when all
updates are silently discarded), even if the result of body
is an error or some other kind of exceptional exit. The
result of dict update is (unless some kind of error occurs)
the result of the evaluation of body. Note that the map-
ping of values to variables does not use traces; changes to
the dictionaryVariables contents only happen when body
terminates.</p>

<p>dict values dictionaryValue ?globPattern? Return a list
of all values in the given dictionary value. If a pattern is
supplied, only those values that match it (according to the
rules of string match) will be returned. The returned values
will be in the order of that the keys associated with those
values were inserted into the dictionary.</p>

<p>dict with dictionaryVariable ?key ...? body Execute the
Tcl script in body with the value for each key in
dictionaryVariable mapped (in a manner similarly to dict
update) to a variable with the same name. Where one or more
keys are available, these indicate a chain of nested
dictionaries, with the innermost dictionary being the one
opened out for the execu- tion of body. As with dict update,
making dictionaryVariable unreadable will make the updates
to the dictionary be discarded, and this also happens if the
contents of dictionaryVariable are adjusted so that the
chain of dictionaries no longer exists. The result of dict
with is (unless some kind of error occurs) the result of the
evaluation of body. Note that the mapping of val- ues to
variables does not use traces; changes to the dictionary-
Variable s contents only happen when body terminates.</p>

<p>DICTIONARY VALUES Dictionaries are values that contain
an efficient, order-preserving mapping from arbitrary keys
to arbitrary values. Each key in the dic- tionary maps to a
single value. They have a textual format that is exactly
that of any list with an even number of elements, with each
mapping in the dictionary being represented as two items in
the list. When a command takes a dictionary and produces a
new dictionary based on it (either returning it or writing
it back into the variable that the starting dictionary was
read from) the new dictionary will have the same order of
keys, modulo any deleted keys and with new keys added on to
the end. When a string is interpreted as a dictionary and it
would otherwise have duplicate keys, only the last value for
a particular key is used; the others are ignored, meaning
that, apple banana and apple carrot apple banana are
equivalent dictionaries (with different string
representations).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Constructing and using nested dictionaries: #
Data for one employee dict set employeeInfo 12345-A
forenames &quot;Joe&quot; dict set employeeInfo 12345-A
surname &quot;Schmoe&quot; dict set employeeInfo 12345-A
street &quot;147 Short Street&quot; dict set employeeInfo
12345-A city &quot;Springfield&quot; dict set employeeInfo
12345-A phone &quot;555-1234&quot; # Data for another
employee dict set employeeInfo 98372-J forenames
&quot;Anne&quot; dict set employeeInfo 98372-J surname
&quot;Other&quot; dict set employeeInfo 98372-J street
&quot;32995 Oakdale Way&quot; dict set employeeInfo 98372-J
city &quot;Springfield&quot; dict set employeeInfo 98372-J
phone &quot;555-8765&quot; # The above data probably ought
to come from a database...</p>

<p># Print out some employee info set i 0 puts &quot;There
are [dict size $employeeInfo] employees&quot; dict for {id
info} $employeeInfo { puts &quot;Employee #[incr i]:
$id&quot; dict with info { puts &quot; Name: $forenames
$surname&quot; puts &quot; Address: $street, $city&quot;
puts &quot; Telephone: $phone&quot; } } # Another way to
iterate and pick out names... foreach id [dict keys
$employeeInfo] { puts &quot;Hello, [dict get $employeeInfo
$id forenames]!&quot; }</p>

<p>A localizable version of string toupper: # Set up the
basic C locale set capital [dict create C [dict create]]
foreach c [split {abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz} &quot;&quot;]
{ dict set capital C $c [string toupper $c] }</p>

<p># English locales can luckily share the &quot;C&quot;
locale dict set capital en [dict get $capital C] dict set
capital en_US [dict get $capital C] dict set capital en_GB
[dict get $capital C]</p>

<p># ... and so on for other supported languages ...</p>

<p># Now get the mapping for the current locale and use it.
set upperCaseMap [dict get $capital $env(LANG)] set
upperCase [string map $upperCaseMap $string]</p>
