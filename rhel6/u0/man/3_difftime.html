<p>NAME difftime - calculate time difference</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The difftime() function returns the number
of seconds elapsed between time time1 and time time0,
represented as a double. The two times are specified in
calendar time, which represents the time elapsed since the
Epoch (00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC)).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.</p>

<p>NOTES On a POSIX system, time_t is an arithmetic type,
and one could just define</p>

<p>#define difftime(t1,t0) (double)(t1 - t0)</p>

<p>when the possible overflow in the subtraction is not a
concern. On other systems, the data type time_t might use
some other encoding where subtraction doesnt work
directly.</p>
