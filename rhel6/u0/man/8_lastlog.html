<p>LASTLOG(8) System Management Commands LASTLOG(8)</p>

<p>NAME lastlog - reports the most recent login of all
users or of a given user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lastlog [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lastlog formats and prints the contents of
the last login log /var/log/lastlog file. The login-name,
port, and last login time will be printed. The default (no
flags) causes lastlog entries to be printed, sorted by their
order in /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the lastlog command
are:</p>

<p>-b, --before DAYS Print only lastlog records older than
DAYS.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-t, --time DAYS Print the lastlog records more recent
than DAYS.</p>

<p>-u, --user LOGIN|RANGE Print the lastlog record of the
specified user(s).</p>

<p>The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical
user ID, or a RANGE of users. This RANGE of users can be
specified with a min and max values (UID_MIN-UID_MAX), a max
value (-UID_MAX), or a min value (UID_MIN-).</p>

<p>If the user has never logged in the message ** Never
logged in** will be displayed instead of the port and
time.</p>

<p>Only the entries for the current users of the system
will be displayed. Other entries may exist for users that
were deleted previously.</p>

<p>NOTE The lastlog file is a database which contains info
on the last login of each user. You should not rotate it. It
is a sparse file, so its size on the disk is usually much
smaller than the one shown by &quot;ls -l&quot; (which can
indicate a really big file if you have in passwd users with
a high UID). You can display its real size with &quot;ls
-s&quot;.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/lastlog Database times of previous user
logins.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Large gaps in UID numbers will cause the lastlog
program to run longer with no output to the screen (i.e. if
in lastlog database there is no entries for users with UID
between 170 and 800 lastlog will appear to hang as it
processes entries with UIDs 171-799).</p>
