<p>NAME doveadm-mailbox - Commands related to handling
mailboxes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] mailbox_cmd
[options] [arguments]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION doveadm mailbox can be used to query and
modify mailboxes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-f formatter Specifies the formatter for formatting the
output. Supported formatters are:</p>

<p>flow prints each line with key=value pairs.</p>

<p>pager prints each key: value pair on its own line and
separates records with form feed character (^L).</p>

<p>tab prints a table header followed by tab separated
value lines.</p>

<p>table prints a table header followed by adjusted value
lines.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the sql userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in the
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over
all users.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mailbox Is the name of a mailbox, as visible
to IMAP clients, except in UTF-8 format. The hierarchy
separator between a parent and child mailbox is commonly
&rsquo;/&rsquo; or &rsquo;.&rsquo;, but this depends on your
selected mailbox storage format and namespace configuration.
The mailbox names may also require a namespace prefix.</p>

<p>COMMANDS mailbox create doveadm mailbox create [-A|-u
user] [-s] mailbox ...</p>

<p>This command is used to create one or more mailboxes.
The mailbox for- mat of the created mailboxes depends on the
mail_location setting, or the user&rsquo;s mail field,
returned by the userdb.</p>

<p>When the -s option was given, the created mailboxes will
be also added to the user&rsquo;s subscriptions.</p>

<p>mailbox delete doveadm mailbox delete [-A|-u user] [-s]
mailbox ...</p>

<p>This command deletes a mailbox and expunges all the
messages it con- tains. If the mailbox has any children,
they won&rsquo;t be deleted. When the -s option is present,
the deleted mailboxes will be also unsubscribed.</p>

<p>mailbox list doveadm mailbox list [-7|-8] [-A|-u user]
[-s] [mailbox ...]</p>

<p>To get an overview of existing mailboxes use this
command. It&rsquo;s also possible to use wildcards in the
mailbox name. When the -s option is present, only subscribed
mailboxes will be listed. Listed subscriptions may also
contain mailboxes that are already deleted.</p>

<p>-7 Lists the mailboxes with mUTF-7 encoding.</p>

<p>-8 Lists the mailboxes with UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>mailbox mutf7 doveadm mailbox mutf7 [-7|-8] name ...</p>

<p>The mailbox mutf7 command may be used to convert the
international mailbox name into a modified version of the
UTF-7 encoding and vice versa. See RFC 3501, section 5.1.3
(Mailbox International Naming Con- vention).</p>

<p>-7 Indicates that the name&rsquo;s string representation
is mUTF-7 encoded and it should be converted to UTF-8.</p>

<p>-8 Indicates that the name&rsquo;s is UTF-8 encoded and
should be con- verted to mUTF-7 (default).</p>

<p>name One or more mailbox names that should be
converted.</p>

<p>mailbox rename doveadm mailbox rename [-A|-u user] [-s]
old_name new_name</p>

<p>The mailbox rename command is used to rename the mailbox
old_name to new_name. When the -s option is given, old_name
will be unsubscribed and new_name will be subscribed.</p>

<p>mailbox status doveadm [-f formatter] mailbox status
[-A|-u user] [-t] fields mail- box ...</p>

<p>Show the status of one or more mailboxes. The mailbox
name may also contain wildcards. This command uses by
default the output formatter flow.</p>

<p>-t Summarize the values of the status fields messages,
recent, unseen and/or vsize of multiple mailboxes to a sum
(total).</p>

<p>fields Specify the status fields which should be shown.
In order to specify multiple status fields, enclosed them in
quotes.</p>

<p>all This is a special status field name. It means show
all of the following fields. When the -t option is present,
it means show only the messages, recent, unseen and vsize
fields.</p>

<p>guid The mailbox&rsquo;s globally unique identifier.</p>

<p>highestmodseq The highest mod-sequence value of all
messages in the mailbox.</p>

<p>messages The number of messages in the mailbox.</p>

<p>recent The number of messages with the lag set.</p>

<p>uidnext The next unique identifier value.</p>

<p>uidvalidity The unique identifier validity value.</p>

<p>unseen The message sequence number of the first unseen
message in the mailbox.</p>

<p>vsize The mailbox&rsquo;s virtual size, computed with
CRLF line ter- minators.</p>

<p>mailbox subscribe doveadm mailbox subscribe [-A|-u user]
mailbox ...</p>

<p>This command is used to subscribe one or more
mailboxes.</p>

<p>mailbox unsubscribe doveadm mailbox unsubscribe [-A|-u
user] mailbox ...</p>

<p>This command is used to unsubscribe one or more
mailboxes.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE List subscribed mailboxes, beginning with
&rsquo;dovecot&rsquo;, of user bob.</p>

<p>doveadm mailbox list -s -u bob dovecot* dovecot
dovecot/pigeonhole dovecot/pigeonhole/2.0</p>

<p>Now have a look at the status of user bob&rsquo;s
dovecot mailboxes.</p>
