<p>OPENVT(1) Linux 1.x OPENVT(1)</p>

<p>NAME openvt - start a program on a new virtual terminal
(VT).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS openvt [-c vtnumber] [-s] [-u] [-l] [-v] [--]
command command_options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION openvt will find the first available VT, and
run on it the given com- mand with the given command
options, standard input, output and error are directed to
that terminal. The current search path ($PATH) is used to
find the requested command. If no command is specified then
the environment variable $SHELL is used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c vtnumber Use the given VT number and not the
first available. Note you must have write access to the
supplied VT for this to work.</p>

<p>-f Force opening a VT without checking whether it is
already in use.</p>

<p>-e Directly execute the given command, without forking.
This option is meant for use in /etc/inittab.</p>

<p>-s Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The
VT of the new command will be made the new current VT.</p>

<p>-u Figure out the owner of the current VT, and run login
as that user. Suitable to be called by init. Shouldnt be
used with -c or -l.</p>

<p>-l Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to
the name of the command to be executed.</p>

<p>-v Be a bit more verbose.</p>

<p>-w wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used
together then openvt will switch back to the controlling
terminal when the command completes.</p>

<p>-- end of options to openvt.</p>

<p>NOTE If openvt is compiled with a POSIX (GNU) getopt()
and you wish to set options to the command to be run, then
you must supply the end of options -- flag before the
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES openvt can be used to start a shell on the next
free VT, by using the command:</p>

<p>openvt bash</p>

<p>To start the shell as a login shell, use:</p>

<p>openvt -l bash</p>

<p>To get a long listing you must supply the --
separator:</p>

<p>openvt -- ls -l</p>

<p>HISTORY Earlier, openvt was called open. It was written
by Jon Tombs &lt;jon@gtex02.us.es or
jon@robots.ox.ac.uk&gt;. The -w idea is from
&quot;sam&quot;.</p>
