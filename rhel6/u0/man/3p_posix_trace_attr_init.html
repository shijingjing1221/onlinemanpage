<p>POSIX_TRACE_ATTR_DESTROY(3PPOSIX Programmer s
ManuPOSIX_TRACE_ATTR_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_attr_destroy, posix_trace_attr_init -
destroy and initial- ize the trace stream attributes object
(TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_destroy(trace_attr_t *attr); int
posix_trace_attr_init(trace_attr_t *attr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_attr_destroy() function
shall destroy an initialized trace attributes object. A
destroyed attr attributes object can be reinitialized using
posix_trace_attr_init(); the results of otherwise
referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
undefined.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_attr_init() function shall initialize a
trace attributes object attr with the default value for all
of the individual attributes used by a given implementation.
The read-only generation- version and clock-resolution
attributes of the newly initialized trace attributes object
shall be set to their appropriate values (see Trace Stream
Attributes ).</p>

<p>Results are undefined if posix_trace_attr_init() is
called specifying an already initialized attr attributes
object.</p>

<p>Implementations may add extensions to the trace
attributes object structure as permitted in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 2,
Conformance.</p>

<p>The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by
setting individ- ual attributes values), when used by
posix_trace_create(), defines the attributes of the trace
stream created. A single attributes object can be used in
multiple calls to posix_trace_create(). After one or more
trace streams have been created using an attributes object,
any func- tion affecting that attributes object, including
destruction, shall not affect any trace stream previously
created. An initialized attributes object also serves to
receive the attributes of an existing trace stream or trace
log when calling the posix_trace_get_attr() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_attr_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_attr_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
trace attributes object.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
