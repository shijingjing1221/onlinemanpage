<p>RMMOD(8) RMMOD(8)</p>

<p>NAME rmmod - simple program to remove a module from the
Linux Kernel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmmod [ -f ] [ -w ] [ -s ] [ -v ] [ modulename
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rmmod is a trivial program to remove a
module from the kernel. Most users will want to use
modprobe(8) with the -r option instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v --verbose Print messages about what the
program is doing. Usually rmmod prints messages only if
something goes wrong.</p>

<p>-f --force This option can be extremely dangerous: it
has no effect unless CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD was set when
the kernel was compiled. With this option, you can remove
modules which are being used, or which are not designed to
be removed, or have been marked as unsafe (see
lsmod(8)).</p>

<p>-w --wait Normally, rmmod will refuse to unload modules
which are in use. With this option, rmmod will isolate the
module, and wait until the module is no longer used. Nothing
new will be able to use the module, but it s up to you to
make sure the current users eventually finish with it. See
lsmod(8)) for information on usage counts.</p>

<p>-s --syslog Send errors to syslog instead of standard
error.</p>

<p>-V --version Show version of program and exit.</p>
