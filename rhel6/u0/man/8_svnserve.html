<p>NAME svnserve - Server for the svn repository access
method</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS svnserve [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION svnserve allows access to Subversion
repositories using the svn network protocol. It can both run
as a standalone server process, or it can run out of inetd.
You must choose a mode of operation when you start svnserve.
The following options are recognized:</p>

<p>-d, --daemon Causes svnserve to run in daemon mode.
svnserve backgrounds itself and accepts and serves TCP/IP
connections on the svn port (3690, by default).</p>

<p>--listen-port=port Causes svnserve to listen on port
when run in daemon mode.</p>

<p>--listen-host=host Causes svnserve to listen on the
interface specified by host, which may be either a hostname
or an IP address.</p>

<p>--foreground When used together with -d, this option
causes svnserve to stay in the foreground. This option is
mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>-i, --inetd Causes svnserve to use the stdin/stdout file
descriptors, as is appropriate for a daemon running out of
inetd.</p>

<p>-h, --help Displays a usage summary and exits.</p>

<p>--version Print svnserves version and the repository
filesystem back-end(s) a particular svnserve supports.</p>

<p>-r root, --root=root Sets the virtual root for
repositories served by svnserve. The pathname in URLs
provided by the client will be interpreted rela- tive to
this root, and will not be allowed to escape this root.</p>

<p>-R --read-only Force all write operations through this
svnserve instance to be forbidden, overriding all other
access policy configuration. Do not use this option to set
general repository access policy - that is what the
conf/svnserve.conf repository configuration file is for.
This option should be used only to restrict access via a
certain method of invoking svnserve - for example, to allow
write access via SSH, but not via a svnserve daemon, or to
create a restricted SSH key which is only capable of read
access.</p>

<p>-t, --tunnel Causes svnserve to run in tunnel mode,
which is just like the inetd mode of operation (serve one
connection over stdin/stdout) except that the connection is
considered to be pre-authenticated with the username of the
current uid. This flag is selected by the client when
running over a tunnel agent.</p>

<p>--tunnel-user=username When combined with --tunnel,
overrides the pre-authenticated user- name with the supplied
username. This is useful in combination with the ssh
authorized_key file s &quot;command&quot; directive to allow
a single system account to be used by multiple committers,
each hav- ing a distinct ssh identity.</p>

<p>-T, --threads When running in daemon mode, causes
svnserve to spawn a thread instead of a process for each
connection. The svnserve process still backgrounds itself at
startup time.</p>

<p>--config-file=filename When specified, svnserve reads
filename once at program startup and caches the svnserve
configuration and any passwords and autho- rization
configuration referenced from filename. svnserve will not
read any per-repository conf/svnserve.conf files when this
option is used. See the svnserve.conf(5) man page for
details of the file format for this option.</p>

<p>--pid-file=filename When specified, svnserve will write
its process ID to filename.</p>

<p>-X, --listen-once Causes svnserve to accept one
connection on the svn port, serve it, and exit. This option
is mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>Unless the --config-file option was specified on the
command line, once the client has selected a repository by
transmitting its URL, svnserve reads a file named
conf/svnserve.conf in the repository directory to determine
repository-specific settings such as what authentication
database to use and what authorization policies to apply.
See the svnserve.conf(5) man page for details of that file
format.</p>
