<p>PATCH(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PATCH(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME patch - apply changes to files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS patch [-blNR][ -c| -e| -n][-d dir][-D
define][-i patchfile] [-o outfile][-p num][-r
rejectfile][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The patch utility shall read a source
(patch) file containing any of the three forms of difference
(diff) listings produced by the diff utility (normal,
context, or in the style of ed) and apply those dif-
ferences to a file. By default, patch shall read from the
standard input.</p>

<p>The patch utility shall attempt to determine the type of
the diff list- ing, unless overruled by a -c, -e, or -n
option.</p>

<p>If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch
shall attempt to apply each of them as if they came from
separate patch files. (In this case, the application shall
ensure that the name of the patch file is determinable for
each diff listing.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The patch utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-b Save a copy of the original contents of each modified
file, before the differences are applied, in a file of the
same name with the suffix .orig appended to it. If the file
already exists, it shall be overwritten; if multiple patches
are applied to the same file, the .orig file shall be
written only for the first patch. When the -o outfile option
is also specified, file .orig shall not be created but, if
outfile already exists, out- file .orig shall be
created.</p>

<p>-c Interpret the patch file as a context difference (the
output of the utility diff when the -c or -C options are
specified).</p>

<p>-d dir Change the current directory to dir before
processing as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p>-D define Mark changes with one of the following C
preprocessor con- structs:</p>

<p>#ifdef define ... #endif</p>

<p>#ifndef define ... #endif</p>

<p>optionally combined with the C preprocessor construct
#else. If the patched file is processed with the C
preprocessor, where the macro define is defined, the output
shall contain the changes from the patch file; otherwise,
the output shall not contain the patches specified in the
patch file.</p>

<p>-e Interpret the patch file as an ed script, rather than
a diff script.</p>

<p>-i patchfile Read the patch information from the file
named by the pathname patchfile, rather than the standard
input.</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Cause any sequence of
&lt;blank&gt;s in the differ- ence script to match any
sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s in the input file. Other
characters shall be matched exactly.</p>

<p>-n Interpret the script as a normal difference.</p>

<p>-N Ignore patches where the differences have already
been applied to the file; by default, already-applied
patches shall be rejected.</p>

<p>-o outfile Instead of modifying the files (specified by
the file operand or the difference listings) directly, write
a copy of the file ref- erenced by each patch, with the
appropriate differences applied, to outfile. Multiple
patches for a single file shall be applied to the
intermediate versions of the file created by any previous
patches, and shall result in multiple, concatenated versions
of the file being written to outfile.</p>

<p>-p num For all pathnames in the patch file that indicate
the names of files to be patched, delete num pathname
components from the beginning of each pathname. If the
pathname in the patch file is absolute, any leading slashes
shall be considered the first com- ponent (that is, -p 1
shall remove the leading slashes). Speci- fying -p 0 shall
cause the full pathname to be used. If -p is not specified,
only the basename (the final pathname component) shall be
used.</p>

<p>-R Reverse the sense of the patch script; that is,
assume that the difference script was created from the new
version to the old version. The -R option cannot be used
with ed scripts. The patch utility shall attempt to reverse
each portion of the script before applying it. Rejected
differences shall be saved in swapped format. If this option
is not specified, and until a portion of the patch file is
successfully applied, patch attempts to apply each portion
in its reversed sense as well as in its normal sense. If the
attempt is successful, the user shall be prompted to
determine whether the -R option should be set.</p>

<p>-r rejectfile Override the default reject filename. In
the default case, the reject file shall have the same name
as the output file, with the suffix .rej appended to it; see
Patch Application .</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to patch.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of patch:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the locale for recognizing the format
of file times- tamps written by the diff utility in a
context-difference input file.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
and informational mes- sages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output of the patch utility, the save
files ( .orig suffixes), and the reject files ( .rej
suffixes) shall be text files.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION A patch file may contain patching
instructions for more than one file; filenames shall be
determined as specified in Filename Determination . When the
-b option is specified, for each patched file, the original
shall be saved in a file of the same name with the suffix
.orig appended to it.</p>

<p>For each patched file, a reject file may also be created
as noted in Patch Application . In the absence of a -r
option, the name of this file shall be formed by appending
the suffix .rej to the original file- name.</p>

<p>Patch File Format The patch file shall contain zero or
more lines of header information followed by one or more
patches. Each patch shall contain zero or more lines of
filename identification in the format produced by diff -c,
and one or more sets of diff output, which are customarily
called hunks.</p>

<p>The patch utility shall recognize the following
expression in the header information:</p>

<p>Index: pathname</p>

<p>The file to be patched is named pathname.</p>

<p>If all lines (including headers) within a patch begin
with the same leading sequence of &lt;blank&gt;s, the patch
utility shall remove this sequence before proceeding. Within
each patch, if the type of differ- ence is context, the
patch utility shall recognize the following expressions:</p>

<p>*** filename timestamp</p>

<p>The patches arose from filename.</p>

<p>--- filename timestamp</p>

<p>The patches should be applied to filename.</p>

<p>Each hunk within a patch shall be the diff output to
change a line range within the original file. The line
numbers for successive hunks within a patch shall occur in
ascending order.</p>

<p>Filename Determination If no file operand is specified,
patch shall perform the following steps to determine the
filename to use:</p>

<p>1. If the type of diff is context, the patch utility
shall delete pathname components (as specified by the -p
option) from the file- name on the line beginning with
&quot;***&quot;, then test for the existence of this file
relative to the current directory (or the directory
specified with the -d option). If the file exists, the patch
util- ity shall use this filename.</p>

<p>2. If the type of diff is context, the patch utility
shall delete the pathname components (as specified by the -p
option) from the file- name on the line beginning with
&quot;---&quot;, then test for the existence of this file
relative to the current directory (or the directory
specified with the -d option). If the file exists, the patch
util- ity shall use this filename.</p>

<p>3. If the header information contains a line beginning
with the string Index:, the patch utility shall delete
pathname components (as specified by the -p option) from
this line, then test for the exis- tence of this file
relative to the current directory (or the direc- tory
specified with the -d option). If the file exists, the patch
utility shall use this filename.</p>

<p>4. If an SCCS directory exists in the current directory,
patch shall attempt to perform a get -e SCCS/s. filename
command to retrieve an editable version of the file. If the
file exists, the patch utility shall use this filename.</p>

<p>5. The patch utility shall write a prompt to standard
output and request a filename interactively from the
controlling terminal (for example, /dev/tty).</p>

<p>Patch Application If the -c, -e, or -n option is
present, the patch utility shall inter- pret information
within each hunk as a context difference, an ed dif-
ference, or a normal difference, respectively. In the
absence of any of these options, the patch utility shall
determine the type of difference based on the format of
information within the hunk.</p>

<p>For each hunk, the patch utility shall begin to search
for the place to apply the patch at the line number at the
beginning of the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in
applying the previous hunk. If lines match- ing the hunk
context are not found, patch shall scan both forwards and
backwards at least 1000 bytes for a set of lines that match
the hunk context.</p>

<p>If no such place is found and it is a context
difference, then another scan shall take place, ignoring the
first and last line of context. If that fails, the first two
and last two lines of context shall be ignored and another
scan shall be made. Implementations may search more
extensively for installation locations.</p>

<p>If no location can be found, the patch utility shall
append the hunk to the reject file. The rejected hunk shall
be written in context-differ- ence format regardless of the
format of the patch file. If the input was a normal or
ed-style difference, the reject file may contain dif-
ferences with zero lines of context. The line numbers on the
hunks in the reject file may be different from the line
numbers in the patch file since they shall reflect the
approximate locations for the failed hunks in the new file
rather than the old one.</p>

<p>If the type of patch is an ed diff, the implementation
may accomplish the patching by invoking the ed utility.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>1 One or more lines were written to a reject file.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Patches that cannot be correctly
placed in the file shall be written to a reject file.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -R option does not work with ed
scripts because there is too little information to
reconstruct the reverse operation.</p>

<p>The -p option makes it possible to customize a patch
file to local user directory structures without manually
editing the patch file. For exam- ple, if the filename in
the patch file was:</p>

<p>/curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>Setting -p 0 gives the entire pathname unmodified; -p 1
gives:</p>

<p>curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>without the leading slash, -p 4 gives:</p>

<p>blurfl/blurfl.c</p>

<p>and not specifying -p at all gives:</p>

<p>blurfl.c .</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some of the functionality in historical patch
implementations was not specified. The following documents
those features present in historical implementations that
have not been specified.</p>

<p>A deleted piece of functionality was the+pseudo-option
allowing an additional set of options and a patch file
operand to be given. This was seen as being insufficiently
useful to standardize.</p>

<p>In historical implementations, if the string
&quot;Prereq:&quot; appeared in the header, the patch
utility would search for the corresponding version
information (the string specified in the header, delimited
by &lt;blank&gt;s or the beginning or end of a line or the
file) anywhere in the original file. This was deleted as too
simplistic and insufficiently trustworthy a mechanism to
standardize. For example, if:</p>

<p>Prereq: 1.2</p>

<p>were in the header, the presence of a delimited 1.2
anywhere in the file would satisfy the prerequisite.</p>

<p>The following options were dropped from historical
implementations of patch as insufficiently useful to
standardize:</p>

<p>-b The -b option historically provided a method for
changing the name extension of the backup file from the
default .orig. This option has been modified and retained in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>-F The -F option specified the number of lines of a
context diff to ignore when searching for a place to install
a patch.</p>

<p>-f The -f option historically caused patch not to
request addi- tional information from the user.</p>

<p>-r The -r option historically provided a method of
overriding the extension of the reject file from the default
.rej.</p>

<p>-s The -s option historically caused patch to work
silently unless an error occurred.</p>

<p>-x The -x option historically set internal debugging
flags.</p>

<p>In some file system implementations, the saving of a
.orig file may produce unwanted results. In the case of 12,
13, or 14-character file- names (on file systems supporting
14-character maximum filenames), the .orig file overwrites
the new file. The reject file may also exceed this filename
limit. It was suggested, due to some historical practice,
that a tilde ( ~) suffix be used instead of .orig and some
other character instead of the .rej suffix. This was
rejected because it is not obvious to the user which file is
which. The suffixes .orig and .rej are clearer and more
understandable.</p>

<p>The -b option has the opposite sense in some historical
implementa- tions-do not save the .orig file. The default
case here is not to save the files, making patch behave more
consistently with the other stan- dard utilities.</p>

<p>The -w option in early proposals was changed to -l to
match historical practice.</p>

<p>The -N option was included because without it, a
non-interactive appli- cation cannot reject previously
applied patches. For example, if a user is piping the output
of diff into the patch utility, and the user only wants to
patch a file to a newer version non-interactively, the -N
option is required.</p>

<p>Changes to the -l option description were proposed to
allow matching across &lt;newline&gt;s in addition to just
&lt;blank&gt;s. Since this is not his- torical practice, and
since some ambiguities could result, it is sug- gested that
future developments in this area utilize another option
letter, such as -L.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
