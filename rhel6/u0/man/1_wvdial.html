<p>NAME wvdial - PPP dialer with built-in intelligence.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wvdial [ OPTIONS ] [ SECTION ] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wvdial is an intelligent PPP dialer, which
means that it dials a modem and starts PPP in order to
connect to the Internet. It is something like the chat(8)
program, except that it uses heuristics to guess how to dial
and log into your server rather than forcing you to write a
login script.</p>

<p>When wvdial starts, it first loads its configuration
from /etc/wvdial.conf and ~/.wvdialrc which contains basic
information about the modem port, speed, and init string,
along with information about your Internet Service Provider
(ISP), such as the phone number, your username, and your
password.</p>

<p>Then it initializes your modem and dials the server and
waits for a connection (a CONNECT string from the modem). It
understands and responds to typical connection problems
(like BUSY and NO DIALTONE).</p>

<p>Any time after connecting, wvdial will start PPP if it
sees a PPP sequence from the server. Otherwise, it tries to
convince the server to start PPP by doing the following:</p>

<p>&middot; responding to any login/password prompts it
sees;</p>

<p>&middot; interpreting choose one of the following-style
menus;</p>

<p>&middot; eventually, sending the word ppp (a common
terminal server com- mand).</p>

<p>If all of this fails, wvdial just runs pppd(8) and hopes
for the best. It will bring up the connection, and then wait
patiently for you to drop the link by pressing CTRL-C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Several options are recognized by wvdial.</p>

<p>-c, --chat Run wvdial as a chat replacement from within
pppd, instead of the more normal method of having wvdial
negotiate the connection and then call pppd.</p>

<p>-C, --config=CONFIGFILE Run wvdial with CONFIGFILE as
the configuration file, instead of /etc/wvdial.conf. This is
mainly useful only if you want to have per-user
configurations, or you want to avoid having dial- up
information (usernames, passwords, calling card numbers,
etc.) in a system wide configuration file.</p>

<p>--remotename Override the Remote Name setting in the
dialer configuration section of the configuration file. This
is mainly useful when you dial to multiple systems with the
same user name and pass- word, and you dont want to use
inheritance to override this setting (which is the
recommended way to do it).</p>

<p>-n, --no-syslog Dont output debug information to the
syslog daemon (only useful together with --chat).</p>

<p>wvdial is normally run without command line options, in
which case it reads its configuration from the [Dialer
Defaults] section of /etc/wvdial.conf. (The configuration
file is described in more detail in wvdial.conf(5) manual
page.)</p>

<p>One or more SECTIONs of /etc/wvdial.conf may be
specified on the com- mand line. Settings in these sections
will override settings in [Dialer Defaults].</p>

<p>For example, the command: wvdial phone2 will read
default options from the [Dialer Defaults] section, then
override any or all of the options with those found in the
[Dialer phone2] section.</p>

<p>If more than one section is specified, they are
processed in the order they are given. Each section will
override all the sections that came before it.</p>

<p>For example, the command: wvdial phone2 pulse shh will
read default options from the [Dialer Defaults] section,
then override any or all of the options with those found in
the [Dialer phone2] section, followed by the [Dialer pulse]
section, and lastly the [Dialer shh] section.</p>

<p>Using this method, it is possible to easily configure
wvdial to switch between different internet providers, modem
init strings, account names, and so on without specifying
the same configuration information over and over.</p>

<p>BUGS Intelligent programs are frustrating when they don
t work right. This version of wvdial has only minimal
support for disabling or over- riding its intelligence, with
the Stupid Mode , Login Prompt, and Password Prompt options.
So, in general if you have a nice ISP, it will probably
work, and if you have a weird ISP, it might not.</p>

<p>Still, its not much good if it doesnt work for you,
right? Dont be fooled by the fact that wvdial finally made
it to version 1.00; it could well contain many bugs and
misfeatures. Let us know if you have problems by sending
e-mail to &lt;wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca&gt;.</p>

<p>You may encounter some error messages if you dont have
write access to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets. Unfortunately, theres really no nice
way around this yet.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/wvdial.conf Configuration file which contains
modem, dialing, and login information. See
wvdial.conf(5).</p>

<p>/dev/ttyS* Serial port devices.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/peers/wvdial Required for correct
authentication in pppd version 2.3.0 or newer.</p>

<p>/etc/ppp/{pap,chap}-secrets Contains a list of usernames
and passwords used by pppd for authentication. wvdial
maintains this list automatically.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Dave Coombs and Avery Pennarun for Net
Integration Technologies. We would also like to thank SuSE
and RedHat for adding a number of various cool features to
wvdial. Thanks guys!</p>
