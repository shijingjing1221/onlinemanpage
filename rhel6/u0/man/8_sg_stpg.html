<p>NAME sg_stpg - sends a SCSI SET TARGET PORT GROUPS
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_stpg [--active] [--help] [--hex] [--offline]
[--optimized] [--raw] [--standby] [--state=S,S...]
[--tp=P,P...] [--unavailable] [--verbose] [--version]
DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send a SCSI SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command
to DEVICE. This utility has different modes depending on
whether the --tp= option is given.</p>

<p>If --tp= is given then the SET TARGET PORT GROUPS
command parameter block is built with a descriptor for each
element in the list given to --tp=. The corresponding
asymmetric access state value is either taken from the
--state= list or, if that is not given, from one of the
explicit state options (e.g. --unavailable), used repeatedly
if required.</p>

<p>If --tp= is not given then a sequence of SCSI commands
are sent to the DEVICE leading up to the SET TARGET PORT
GROUPS command. First an INQUIRY is sent to fetch the device
identification VPD page to find the (primary) target port
group associated with DEVICE. Then a REPORT TAR- GET PORT
GROUPS command is issued to find the current state and
whether a transition to the requested state is supported. If
so the SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command is sent.</p>

<p>Target port group access is described in SPC-4 found at
www.t10.org in section 5.8 (in rev 11 dated 2007/5/14). The
SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command is also described in that
document.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The options are arranged in
alphabetical order based on the long option name.</p>

<p>-a, --active set active/non-optimized state.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output response to the REPORT TARGET PORT
GROUPS command in hex then exit.</p>

<p>-O, -l, --offline set offline state. This is the
appropriate state to set a target port to prior to removing
the device. Note that a relative tar- get port identifier
should be given with this state (rather than a target port
group identifier that all other states take).</p>

<p>-o, --optimized set active/optimized state. If no other
state options or --tp= option are given then
active/optimized is the default state.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output response to the REPORT TARGET PORT
GROUPS command in binary to stdout then exit.</p>

<p>-s, --standby set standby state. Port group shall accept
those commands listed for &quot;unavailable&quot; state plus
LOG SELECT/SENSE, MODE SELECT/SENSE, RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC
RESULTS, SEND DIAGNOSTIC, PER- SISTENT RESERVE IN/OUT
commands.</p>

<p>-S, --state=S,S... specifies a comma separated list (one
element of more) of states. Either a number or an
abbreviation can be given. A num- ber is assumed to be a
decimal number unless it is prefixed by &quot;0x&quot; or
has a trailing &quot;h&quot; in which case a hexadecimal
value is assumed. Only the values 0, 1, 2, 3 or 14 are
accepted. The accepted abbreviations are &quot;an&quot;,
&quot;ao&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or
&quot;u&quot;; which represent active/non-optimized(1),
active/optimized(0), offline(14), standby(2) or
unavailable(3) respectively.</p>

<p>-t, --tp=P,P... specifies a comma separated list (one
element of more). Each elements is either a target port
group identifier (when the cor- responding state is other
than &quot;offline&quot;) or a relative target port
identifier (when the corresponding state is
&quot;offline&quot;). Each element is assumed to be a
decimal number unless it is pre- fixed by &quot;0x&quot; or
has a trailing &quot;h&quot; in which case a hexadecimal
value is assumed.</p>

<p>-u, --unavailable set unavailable state. Port group
shall only accept INQUIRY, REPORT LUNS, REPORT/SET TARGET
PORT GROUPS, REQUEST SENSE and READ/WRITE BUFFER
commands.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES The SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command should be
supported whenever the TPGS value in a standard INQUIRY
response is 2 or 3. [View with sg_inq utility.]</p>

<p>Notice that the offline state is termed as a
&quot;secondary target port asymmetric access state&quot;
and takes a relative target port identifier (i.e. acts on a
single target port). All the other states are termed as
&quot;primary target port asymmetric access states&quot; and
each takes a tar- get port group identifier (i.e. acts on
one or more target ports).</p>

<p>When --tp= is given then the same number of elements
should be given to the --state= option. If more than one
list element is given to --tp= and an equal number of
elements is _not_ given to the the --state= option, then if
only one state is specified then it is repeated.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_stpg is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
