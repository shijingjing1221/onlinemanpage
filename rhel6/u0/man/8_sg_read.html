<p>NAME sg_read - read blocks of data continually from same
offset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_read [blk_sgio=0|1] [bpt=BPT] [bs=BS]
[cdbsz=6|10|12|16] count=COUNT [dio=0|1] [dpo=0|1] [fua=0|1]
if=IFILE [mmap=0|1] [no_dxfer=0|1] [odir=0|1] [skip=SKIP]
[time=TI] [verbose=VERB] [--help] [--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read data from a Linux SCSI generic (sg)
device, a block device or a normal file with each read
command issued to the same offset or logical block address
(lba). This can be used to test (or time) disk caching, SCSI
(or some other) transport throughput, and/or SCSI command
over- head.</p>

<p>When the COUNT value is positive, then up to BPT blocks
are read at a time, until the COUNT is exhausted. Each read
operation starts at the same lba which, if SKIP is not
given, is the beginning of the file or device.</p>

<p>The COUNT value may be negative when IFILE is a sg
device or is a block device with blk_sgio=1 set.
Alternatively bpt=0 may be given. In these cases |COUNT|
&quot;zero block&quot; SCSI READ commands are issued.
&quot;Zero block&quot; means &quot;do nothing&quot; for SCSI
READ 10, 12 and 16 byte commands (but not for the 6 byte
variant). In practice &quot;zero block&quot; SCSI READ
commands have low latency and so are one way to measure SCSI
command overhead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS blk_sgio=0 | 1 The default action of this
utility is to use the Unix read() command when the IFILE is
a block device. In lk 2.6 many block devices can handle SCSI
commands issued via the SG_IO ioctl. So when this option is
set the SG_IO ioctl sends SCSI READ commands to IFILE if it
is a block device.</p>

<p>bpt=BPT where BPT is the maximum number of blocks each
read operation fetches. Fewer blocks will be fetched when
the remaining COUNT is less than BPT. The default value for
BPT is 128. Note that each read operation starts at the same
lba (as given by skip=SKIP or 0). If bpt=0 then the COUNT is
interpreted as the number of zero block SCSI READ commands
to issue.</p>

<p>bs=BS where BS is the size (in bytes) of each block
read. This must be the block size of the physical device
(defaults to 512) if SCSI commands are being issued to
IFILE.</p>

<p>cdbsz=6 | 10 | 12 | 16 size of SCSI READ commands issued
on sg device names, or block devices if blk_sgio=1 is given.
Default is 10 byte SCSI READ cdbs.</p>

<p>count=COUNT when COUNT is a positive number, read that
number of blocks, typically with multiple read operations.
When COUNT is negative then |COUNT| SCSI READ commands are
performed requesting zero blocks to be transferred. This
option is mandatory.</p>

<p>dio=0 | 1 default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value
of 1 attempts direct IO which, if not available, falls back
to indirect IO and notes this at completion. This option is
only active if IFILE is an sg device. If direct IO is
selected and /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio has the value of 0 then
a warning is issued (and indirect IO is performed)</p>

<p>dpo=0 | 1 when set the disable page out (DPO) bit in
SCSI READ commands is set. Otherwise the DPO bit is cleared
(default).</p>

<p>fua=0 | 1 when set the force unit access (FUA) bit in
SCSI READ commands is set. Otherwise the FUA bit is cleared
(default).</p>

<p>if=IFILE read from this IFILE. This argument must be
given. If the IFILE is a normal file then it must be
seekable (if (COUNT &gt; BPT) or skip=SKIP is given). Hence
stdin is not acceptable (and giving &quot;-&quot; as the
IFILE argument is reported as an error).</p>

<p>mmap=0 | 1 default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value
of 1 causes memory mapped IO to be performed. Selecting both
dio and mmap is an error. This option is only active if
IFILE is an sg device.</p>

<p>no_dxfer=0 | 1 when set then DMA transfers from the
device are made into kernel buffers but no further (i.e.
there is no second copy into the user space). The default
value is 0 in which case transfers are made into the user
space. When neither mmap nor dio is set then data transfer
are copied via kernel buffers (i.e. a double copy). Mainly
for testing.</p>

<p>odir=0 | 1 when set opens an IFILE which is a block
device with an addi- tional O_DIRECT flag. The default value
is 0 (i.e. dont open block devices O_DIRECT).</p>

<p>skip=SKIP all read operations will start offset by SKIP
bs-sized blocks from the start of the input file (or
device).</p>

<p>time=TI When TI is 0 (default) doesn t perform timing.
When 1, times transfer and does throughput calculation,
starting at the first issued command until completion. When
2, times transfer and does throughput calculation, starting
at the second issued command until completion. When 3 times
from third command, etc. An aver- age number of commands
(SCSI READs or Unix read()s) executed per second is also
output.</p>

<p>verbose=VERB as VERB increases so does the amount of
debug output sent to stderr. Default value is zero which
yields the minimum amount of debug output. A value of 1
reports extra information that is not repetitive.</p>

<p>--help Output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>--version Output the version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Various numeric arguments (e.g. SKIP) may include
multiplicative suf- fixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage
process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into kernel buffers and
then the sg driver copies this data into user memory. This
is called &quot;indirect IO&quot; and there is a
&quot;dio&quot; option to select &quot;direct IO&quot; which
will DMA directly into user memory. Due to some issues
&quot;direct IO&quot; is disabled in the sg driver and needs
a configuration change to activate it. This is typically
done with &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio&quot;.
An alternate way to avoid the 2 stage copy is to select
memory mapped IO with mmap=1.</p>

<p>SIGNALS The signal handling has been borrowed from dd:
SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIG- PIPE output the number of remaining
blocks to be transferred; then they have their default
action. SIGUSR1 causes the same information to be output yet
the copy continues. All output caused by signals is sent to
stderr.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Let us assume that /dev/sg0 is a disk and we
wish to time the disks cache performance.</p>

<p>sg_read if=/dev/sg0 bs=512 count=1MB mmap=1 time=2</p>

<p>This command will continually read 128 512 byte blocks
from block 0. The &quot;128&quot; is the default value for
bpt while &quot;block 0&quot; is chosen because the skip
argument was not given. This will continue until 1,000,000
blocks are read. The idea behind using time=2 is that the
first 64 KiB read operation will involve reading the
magnetic media while the remaining read operations will
&quot;hit&quot; the disk s cache. The output of third
command will look like this:</p>

<p>time from second command to end was 4.50 secs, 113.70
MB/sec Average number of READ commands per second was
1735.27 1000000+0 records in, SCSI commands issued: 7813</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_read is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
