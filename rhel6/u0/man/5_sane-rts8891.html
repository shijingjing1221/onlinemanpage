<p>sane-rts8891(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-rts8891(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-rts8891 - SANE backend for rts8891 based
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-rts8891 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
scanners based on the rts8891 ASIC.</p>

<p>The scanners that work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model status ---------------------- -----------
Umax Astra 4400 untested Umax Astra 4450 untested HP scanjet
4000c good HP scanjet 4470c good</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xscanimage or xsane.</p>

<p>If you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend main- tainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d rts8891</p>

<p>Scan Mode Options</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are R Color , Gray and Lineart The
default mode is Color. The Lineart mode is black and white
only (1 bit). Grayscale will produce 256 levels of gray (8
bits). Color mode allows for over 16 million different
colors produced from 24 bits of color information.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. The
horizontal and vertical resolutions are set by the value of
this option. The scanner is capable of the following
resolutions for the specified option value:</p>

<p>Value Hor. Resolution Vert. Resolution -----
--------------- ------------------- 75 75dpi 75dpi 150
150dpi 150dpi 300 300dpi 300dpi 600 600dpi 600dpi 1200
1200dpi 1200dpi</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 75 dpi and the scan area and the scan mode
are as specified through their options, or the default if
not specified. The default value for preview mode is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>--threshold selects the minimum-brightness to get a
white point. The threshold is only used with Lineart mode
scans. It is specified as a percentage in the range 0..100%
(in steps of 1). The default value of the threshold option
is 50.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/rts8891.conf contains the usb device ids of
supported scanners (eg usb 0x043d 0x007c) and scanner
configura- tion options. Empty lines and lines starting with
a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>The options supported are allowsharing , modelnumber</p>

<p>Option</p>

<p>allowsharing enables or not the sharing of the scanner
between multiple frontends at the same time.</p>

<p>modelnumber is used to force the reported model by the
backend and is only usefull in the case of a scanner which
NVRAM has been erased. 0 to report a HP4470c. 1 to report a
HP4400c. 2 to report an Astra 4400.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-rts8891.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-rts8891.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_RTS8891 SANE_DEBUG_RTS8891_LOW
SANE_DEBUG_RTS88XX_LIB If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, these environment variables controls
the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 255
requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Scanners of the same model exist with
different sensors, due to lack of data (ie USB logs) some
sensors are better supported than others. At least 75 dpi
mode is working for any model. Sharing the a scanner between
several frontends at the same time (allowsharing option) may
not work on some USB controllers.</p>

<p>XPA is no (yet) supported.</p>

<p>BUGS No bugs currently known.</p>

<p>CREDITS Many thanks go to: Laurent Fournier who donated
me a HP4470c. Vladimir Sysoev and &quot;TheUnruly
Squash&quot; for the time they spent recording USB activ-
ity and testing the experimental version on HP4400
models.</p>
