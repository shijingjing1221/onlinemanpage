<p>NETDEVICE(7) Linux Programmer s Manual NETDEVICE(7)</p>

<p>NAME netdevice - Low level access to Linux network
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt; #include
&lt;net/if.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This man page describes the sockets
interface which is used to config- ure network devices.</p>

<p>Linux supports some standard ioctls to configure network
devices. They can be used on any sockets file descriptor
regardless of the family or type. They pass an ifreq
structure:</p>

<p>struct ifreq { char ifr_name[IFNAMSIZ]; /* Interface
name */ union { struct sockaddr ifr_addr; struct sockaddr
ifr_dstaddr; struct sockaddr ifr_broadaddr; struct sockaddr
ifr_netmask; struct sockaddr ifr_hwaddr; short ifr_flags;
int ifr_ifindex; int ifr_metric; int ifr_mtu; struct ifmap
ifr_map; char ifr_slave[IFNAMSIZ]; char
ifr_newname[IFNAMSIZ]; char *ifr_data; }; };</p>

<p>struct ifconf { int ifc_len; /* size of buffer */ union
{ char *ifc_buf; /* buffer address */ struct ifreq *ifc_req;
/* array of structures */ }; };</p>

<p>Normally, the user specifies which device to affect by
setting ifr_name to the name of the interface. All other
members of the structure may share memory.</p>

<p>Ioctls If an ioctl is marked as privileged then using it
requires an effective user ID of 0 or the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability. If this is not the case EPERM will be
returned.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFNAME Given the ifr_ifindex, return the name of
the interface in ifr_name. This is the only ioctl which
returns its result in ifr_name.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFINDEX Retrieve the interface index of the
interface into ifr_ifindex.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFFLAGS, SIOCSIFFLAGS Get or set the active flag
word of the device. ifr_flags con- tains a bit mask of the
following values:</p>

<p>Device flags IFF_UP Interface is running. IFF_BROADCAST
Valid broadcast address set. IFF_DEBUG Internal debugging
flag. IFF_LOOPBACK Interface is a loopback interface.
IFF_POINTOPOINT Interface is a point-to-point link.
IFF_RUNNING Resources allocated. IFF_NOARP No arp protocol,
L2 destination address not set. IFF_PROMISC Interface is in
promiscuous mode. IFF_NOTRAILERS Avoid use of trailers.
IFF_ALLMULTI Receive all multicast packets. IFF_MASTER
Master of a load balancing bundle. IFF_SLAVE Slave of a load
balancing bundle. IFF_MULTICAST Supports multicast
IFF_PORTSEL Is able to select media type via ifmap.
IFF_AUTOMEDIA Auto media selection active. IFF_DYNAMIC The
addresses are lost when the interface goes down.
IFF_LOWER_UP Driver signals L1 up (since Linux 2.6.17)
IFF_DORMANT Driver signals dormant (since Linux 2.6.17)
IFF_ECHO Echo sent packets (since Linux 2.6.25)</p>

<p>Setting the active flag word is a privileged operation,
but any process may read it.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFMETRIC, SIOCSIFMETRIC Get or set the metric of
the device using ifr_metric. This is currently not
implemented; it sets ifr_metric to 0 if you attempt to read
it and returns EOPNOTSUPP if you attempt to set it.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFMTU, SIOCSIFMTU Get or set the MTU (Maximum
Transfer Unit) of a device using ifr_mtu. Setting the MTU is
a privileged operation. Setting the MTU to too small values
may cause kernel crashes.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFHWADDR, SIOCSIFHWADDR Get or set the hardware
address of a device using ifr_hwaddr. The hardware address
is specified in a struct sockaddr. sa_fam- ily contains the
ARPHRD_* device type, sa_data the L2 hardware address
starting from byte 0. Setting the hardware address is a
privileged operation.</p>

<p>SIOCSIFHWBROADCAST Set the hardware broadcast address of
a device from ifr_hwaddr. This is a privileged
operation.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFMAP, SIOCSIFMAP Get or set the interface s
hardware parameters using ifr_map. Setting the parameters is
a privileged operation.</p>

<p>struct ifmap { unsigned long mem_start; unsigned long
mem_end; unsigned short base_addr; unsigned char irq;
unsigned char dma; unsigned char port; };</p>

<p>The interpretation of the ifmap structure depends on the
device driver and the architecture.</p>

<p>SIOCADDMULTI, SIOCDELMULTI Add an address to or delete
an address from the devices link layer multicast filters
using ifr_hwaddr. These are privileged operations. See also
packet(7) for an alternative.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFTXQLEN, SIOCSIFTXQLEN Get or set the transmit
queue length of a device using ifr_qlen. Setting the
transmit queue length is a privileged operation.</p>

<p>SIOCSIFNAME Changes the name of the interface specified
in ifr_name to ifr_newname. This is a privileged operation.
It is only allowed when the interface is not up.</p>

<p>SIOCGIFCONF Return a list of interface (transport layer)
addresses. This currently means only addresses of the
AF_INET (IPv4) family for compatibility. The user passes a
ifconf structure as argument to the ioctl. It contains a
pointer to an array of ifreq struc- tures in ifc_req and its
length in bytes in ifc_len. The kernel fills the ifreqs with
all current L3 interface addresses that are running:
ifr_name contains the interface name (eth0:1 etc.), ifr_addr
the address. The kernel returns with the actual length in
ifc_len. If ifc_len is equal to the original length the
buffer probably has overflowed and you should retry with a
big- ger buffer to get all addresses. When no error occurs
the ioctl returns 0; otherwise -1. Overflow is not an
error.</p>

<p>Most protocols support their own ioctls to configure
protocol-specific interface options. See the protocol man
pages for a description. For configuring IP addresses see
ip(7).</p>

<p>In addition some devices support private ioctls. These
are not described here.</p>

<p>NOTES Strictly speaking, SIOCGIFCONF is IP specific and
belongs in ip(7).</p>

<p>The names of interfaces with no addresses or that dont
have the IFF_RUNNING flag set can be found via
/proc/net/dev.</p>

<p>Local IPv6 IP addresses can be found via /proc/net or
via rtnetlink(7).</p>

<p>BUGS glibc 2.1 is missing the ifr_newname macro in
&lt;net/if.h&gt;. Add the fol- lowing to your program as a
workaround:</p>

<p>#ifndef ifr_newname #define ifr_newname
ifr_ifru.ifru_slave #endif</p>
