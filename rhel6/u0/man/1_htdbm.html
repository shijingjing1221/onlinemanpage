<p>SUMMARY htdbm is used to manipulate the DBM format files
used to store user- names and password for basic
authentication of HTTP users via mod_authn_dbm. See the
dbmmanage documentation for more information about these DBM
files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Use batch mode; i.e., get the password from
the command line rather than prompting for it. This option
should be used with extreme care, since the password is
clearly visible on the com- mand line.</p>

<p>-c Create the passwdfile. If passwdfile already exists,
it is rewritten and truncated. This option cannot be
combined with the -n option.</p>

<p>-n Display the results on standard output rather than
updating a database. This option changes the syntax of the
command line, since the passwdfile argument (usually the
first one) is omit- ted. It cannot be combined with the -c
option.</p>

<p>-m Use MD5 encryption for passwords. On Windows, Netware
and TPF, this is the default.</p>

<p>-d Use crypt() encryption for passwords. The default on
all plat- forms but Windows, Netware and TPF. Though
possibly supported by htdbm on all platforms, it is not
supported by the httpd server on Windows, Netware and
TPF.</p>

<p>-s Use SHA encryption for passwords. Facilitates
migration from/to Netscape servers using the LDAP Directory
Interchange Format (ldif).</p>

<p>-p Use plaintext passwords. Though htdbm will support
creation on all platforms, the httpd daemon will only accept
plain text passwords on Windows, Netware and TPF.</p>

<p>-l Print each of the usernames and comments from the
database on stdout.</p>

<p>-t Interpret the final parameter as a comment. When this
option is specified, an additional string can be appended to
the command line; this string will be stored in the
&quot;Comment&quot; field of the database, associated with
the specified username.</p>

<p>-v Verify the username and password. The program will
print a mes- sage indicating whether the supplied password
is valid. If the password is invalid, the program exits with
error code 3.</p>

<p>-x Delete user. If the username exists in the specified
DBM file, it will be deleted.</p>

<p>filename The filename of the DBM format file. Usually
without the exten- sion .db, .pag, or .dir. If -c is given,
the DBM file is created if it does not already exist, or
updated if it does exist.</p>

<p>username The username to create or update in passwdfile.
If username does not exist in this file, an entry is added.
If it does exist, the password is changed.</p>

<p>password The plaintext password to be encrypted and
stored in the DBM file. Used only with the -b flag.</p>

<p>-TDBTYPE Type of DBM file (SDBM, GDBM, DB, or
&quot;default&quot;).</p>

<p>BUGS One should be aware that there are a number of
different DBM file for- mats in existence, and with all
likelihood, libraries for more than one format may exist on
your system. The three primary examples are SDBM, NDBM, GNU
GDBM, and Berkeley/Sleepycat DB 2/3/4. Unfortunately, all
these libraries use different file formats, and you must
make sure that the file format used by filename is the same
format that htdbm expects to see. htdbm currently has no way
of determining what type of DBM file it is looking at. If
used against the wrong format, will simply return nothing,
or may create a different DBM file with a different name, or
at worst, it may corrupt the DBM file if you were attempting
to write to it.</p>

<p>One can usually use the file program supplied with most
Unix systems to see what format a DBM file is in.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS htdbm returns a zero status
(&quot;true&quot;) if the username and password have been
successfully added or updated in the DBM File. htdbm returns
1 if it encounters some problem accessing files, 2 if there
was a syntax problem with the command line, 3 if the
password was entered interac- tively and the verification
entry didnt match, 4 if its operation was interrupted, 5 if
a value is too long (username, filename, password, or final
computed record), 6 if the username contains illegal
characters (see the Restrictions section), and 7 if the file
is not a valid DBM password file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES htdbm /usr/local/etc/apache/.htdbm-users
jsmith</p>

<p>Adds or modifies the password for user jsmith. The user
is prompted for the password. If executed on a Windows
system, the password will be encrypted using the modified
Apache MD5 algorithm; otherwise, the sys- tems crypt()
routine will be used. If the file does not exist, htdbm will
do nothing except return an error.</p>

<p>htdbm -c /home/doe/public_html/.htdbm jane</p>

<p>Creates a new file and stores a record in it for user
jane. The user is prompted for the password. If the file
exists and cannot be read, or cannot be written, it is not
altered and htdbm will display a message and return an error
status.</p>

<p>htdbm -mb /usr/web/.htdbm-all jones Pwd4Steve</p>

<p>Encrypts the password from the command line (Pwd4Steve)
using the MD5 algorithm, and stores it in the specified
file.</p>

<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Web password files such as those
managed by htdbm should not be within the Web servers URI
space -- that is, they should not be fetchable with a
browser.</p>

<p>The use of the -b option is discouraged, since when it
is used the unencrypted password appears on the command
line.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS On the Windows and MPE platforms, passwords
encrypted with htdbm are limited to no more than 255
characters in length. Longer passwords will be truncated to
255 characters.</p>

<p>The MD5 algorithm used by htdbm is specific to the
Apache software; passwords encrypted using it will not be
usable with other Web servers.</p>

<p>Usernames are limited to 255 bytes and may not include
the character :.</p>
