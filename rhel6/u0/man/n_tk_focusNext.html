<p>tk_focusNext(n) Tk Built-In Commands tk_focusNext(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME tk_focusNext, tk_focusPrev, tk_focusFollowsMouse -
Utility procedures for managing the input focus.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tk_focusNext window</p>

<p>tk_focusPrev window</p>

<p>tk_focusFollowsMouse
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tk_focusNext is a utility procedure used for
keyboard traversal. It returns the next window after window
in focus order. The focus order is determined by the
stacking order of windows and the structure of the window
hierarchy. Among siblings, the focus order is the same as
the stacking order, with the lowest window being first. If a
window has children, the window is visited first, followed
by its children (recur- sively), followed by its next
sibling. Top-level windows other than window are skipped, so
that tk_focusNext never returns a window in a different
top-level from window.</p>

<p>After computing the next window, tk_focusNext examines
the windows -takefocus option to see whether it should be
skipped. If so, tk_focusNext continues on to the next window
in the focus order, until it eventually finds a window that
will accept the focus or returns back to window.</p>

<p>tk_focusPrev is similar to tk_focusNext except that it
returns the win- dow just before window in the focus
order.</p>

<p>tk_focusFollowsMouse changes the focus model for the
application to an implicit one where the window under the
mouse gets the focus. After this procedure is called,
whenever the mouse enters a window Tk will automatically
give it the input focus. The focus command may be used to
move the focus to a window other than the one under the
mouse, but as soon as the mouse moves into a new window the
focus will jump to that window. Note: at present there is no
built-in support for return- ing the application to an
explicit focus model; to do this you will have to write a
script that deletes the bindings created by tk_focus-
FollowsMouse.</p>
