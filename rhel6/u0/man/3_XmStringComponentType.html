<p>NAME XmStringComponentType Data type for compound string
components</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmStringComponentType is the data type
specifying compound string com- ponent types. A compound
string component identifies some part of a compound string,
and can have a value and length. A compound string component
can be one of the following types. These component types are
grouped according to their length and value types.</p>

<p>The following components have values of NULL and lengths
of 0 (zero).</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR This component usually maps
to a newline or carriage return in displayed text.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TAB This component may be thought of
as a text component contain- ing only a single tab.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LAYOUT_POP The layout direction is
kept on a stack, with the current direction kept on top of
the stack. When this component is read, the most recently
read layout direction is popped off the stack and replaced
by the direction immediately before it.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_END This component marks the end of a
compound string. No other components should follow. If an
application does not place an XmSTRING_COMPONENT_END
component at the end of an XmString, Motif automatically
does it for the application.</p>

<p>The following component has a value of XmDirection and
the length of that direction.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LAYOUT_PUSH The layout direction is
kept on a stack, with the current direction kept on top of
the stack. This component replaces the current layout
direction, and causes another to be pushed onto the top of
this stack.</p>

<p>The following component has a value of XmStringDirection
and the length of that direction.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION This component sets the
string direction by overriding the previous string
direction.</p>

<p>The following components have values of type char * or
some equivalent type, and the lengths of these types.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LOCALE_TEXT This component contains
the multibyte text of a compound string.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_WIDECHAR_TEXT This component contains
the widechar text of a compound string.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT This component contains the
charset text of a compound string. Note that a compound
string cannot contain both charset and locale (multibyte or
widechar) text.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_BEGIN This component marks
the beginning of a new rendition. All text following this
component will be rendered using this rendition as the
primary one. If there is already a rendition in effect, it
is kept in memory and used to fill in any unspecified values
in the primary rendition. Renditions are kept until a
corresponding XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_END component is
encountered.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_END This component
signifies that the specified rendition will no longer be
used to render text, and will not be available to fill in
unspecified values of newer renditions.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_UNKNOWN This component type signifies
that the component contents belong to an unknown component
type.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LOCALE Use this component to specify
the locale in which an interna- tionalized application is to
execute. The only valid charac- ter string for this
component is _MOTIF_DEFAULT_LOCALE.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TAG For charset text, this is the tag
of the font to be used to display the text. This tag is
sometimes referred to as the charset tag or the fontlist
tag.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_CHARSET This component is obsolete
and remains for compatibility with previous releases. It has
been replaced by XmSTRING_COMPO- NENT_TAG.</p>

<p>XmSTRING_COMPONENT_FONTLIST_ELEMENT_TAG This component
is obsolete and remains for compatibility with previous
releases. It has been replaced by XmSTRING_COMPO-
NENT_TAG.</p>

<p>Some compound string components depend on values defined
in other com- ponents. The XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TAB component
definition, for example, depends on information in the
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_BEGIN. To account for these
dependencies, a typical compound string will have its member
components in the following order:</p>

<p>[ [ XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LAYOUT_PUSH ] [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_BEGIN ]* [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TAG | XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LOCALE ] [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TAB ]* [ XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION ] [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT | XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LOCALE_TEXT |
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_WIDECHAR_TEXT ] [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_RENDITION_END ]* [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_LAYOUT_POP ] [
XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR ] ]* XmSTRING_COMPONENT_END</p>
