<p>CDEFTUTORIAL(1) rrdtool CDEFTUTORIAL(1)</p>

<p>NAME cdeftutorial - Alex van den Bogaerdts CDEF
tutorial</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Intention of this document: to provide some
examples of the commonly used parts of RRDtools CDEF
language.</p>

<p>If you think some important feature is not explained
properly, and if adding it to this document would benefit
most users, please do ask me to add it. I will then try to
provide an answer in the next release of this tutorial. No
feedback equals no changes! Additions to this document are
also welcome. -- Alex van den Bogaerdt
&lt;alex@vandenbogaerdt.nl&gt;</p>

<p>Why this tutorial? One of the powerful parts of RRDtool
is its ability to do all sorts of calculations on the data
retrieved from its databases. However, RRDtools many options
and syntax make it difficult for the average user to
understand. The manuals are good at explaining what these
options do; however they do not (and should not) explain in
detail why they are useful. As with my RRDtool tutorial: if
you want a simple document in simple language you should
read this tutorial. If you are happy with the official
documentation, you may find this document too simple or even
boring. If you do choose to read this tutorial, I also
expect you to have read and fully understand my other
tutorial.</p>

<p>More reading If you have difficulties with the way I try
to explain it please read Steve Raders rpntutorial. It may
help you understand how this all works.</p>

<p>What are CDEFs? When retrieving data from an RRD, you
are using a &quot;DEF&quot; to work with that data. Think of
it as a variable that changes over time (where time is the
x-axis). The value of this variable is what is found in the
database at that particular time and you can t do any
modifications on it. This is what CDEFs are for: they takes
values from DEFs and perform calculations on them.</p>

<p>Syntax DEF:var_name_1=some.rrd:ds_name:CF
CDEF:var_name_2=RPN_expression</p>

<p>You first define &quot;var_name_1&quot; to be data
collected from data source &quot;ds_name&quot; found in RRD
&quot;some.rrd&quot; with consolidation function
&quot;CF&quot;.</p>

<p>Assume the ifInOctets SNMP counter is saved in mrtg.rrd
as the DS &quot;in&quot;. Then the following DEF defines a
variable for the average of that data source:</p>

<p>DEF:inbytes=mrtg.rrd:in:AVERAGE</p>

<p>Say you want to display bits per second (instead of
bytes per second as stored in the database.) You have to
define a calculation (hence &quot;CDEF&quot;) on variable
&quot;inbytes&quot; and use that variable (inbits) instead
of the original:</p>

<p>CDEF:inbits=inbytes,8,*</p>

<p>This tells RRDtool to multiply inbytes by eight to get
inbits. Ill explain later how this works. In the graphing or
printing functions, you can now use inbits where you would
use inbytes otherwise.</p>

<p>Note that the variable name used in the CDEF (inbits)
must not be the same as the variable named in the DEF
(inbytes)!</p>

<p>RPN-expressions RPN is short-hand for Reverse Polish
Notation. It works as follows. You put the variables or
numbers on a stack. You also put operations (things-to-do)
on the stack and this stack is then processed. The result
will be placed on the stack. At the end, there should be
exactly one number left: the outcome of the series of
operations. If there is not exactly one number left, RRDtool
will complain loudly.</p>

<p>Above multiplication by eight will look like:</p>

<p>1. Start with an empty stack</p>

<p>2. Put the content of variable inbytes on the stack</p>

<p>3. Put the number eight on the stack</p>

<p>4. Put the operation multiply on the stack</p>

<p>5. Process the stack</p>

<p>6. Retrieve the value from the stack and put it in
variable inbits</p>

<p>We will now do an example with real numbers. Suppose the
variable inbytes would have value 10, the stack would
be:</p>

<p>1. ||</p>

<p>2. |10|</p>

<p>3. |10|8|</p>

<p>4. |10|8|*|</p>

<p>5. |80|</p>

<p>6. ||</p>

<p>Processing the stack (step 5) will retrieve one value
from the stack (from the right at step 4). This is the
operation multiply and this takes two values off the stack
as input. The result is put back on the stack (the value 80
in this case). For multiplication the order doesnt matter,
but for other operations like subtraction and division it
does. Generally speaking you have the following order:</p>

<p>y = A - B --&gt; y=minus(A,B) --&gt; CDEF:y=A,B,-</p>

<p>This is not very intuitive (at least most people don t
think so). For the function f(A,B) you reverse the position
of &quot;f&quot;, but you do not reverse the order of the
variables.</p>

<p>Converting your wishes to RPN First, get a clear picture
of what you want to do. Break down the problem in smaller
portions until they cannot be split anymore. Then it is
rather simple to convert your ideas into RPN.</p>

<p>Suppose you have several RRDs and would like to add up
some counters in them. These could be, for instance, the
counters for every WAN link you are monitoring.</p>

<p>You have:</p>

<p>router1.rrd with link1in link2in router2.rrd with
link1in link2in router3.rrd with link1in link2in</p>

<p>Suppose you would like to add up all these counters,
except for link2in inside router2.rrd. You need to do:</p>

<p>(in this example, &quot;router1.rrd:link1in&quot; means
the DS link1in inside the RRD router1.rrd)</p>

<p>router1.rrd:link1in router1.rrd:link2in
router2.rrd:link1in router3.rrd:link1in router3.rrd:link2in
-------------------- + (outcome of the sum)</p>

<p>As a mathematical function, this could be written:</p>

<p>&quot;add(router1.rrd:link1in , router1.rrd:link2in ,
router2.rrd:link1in , router3.rrd:link1in ,
router3.rrd:link2.in)&quot;</p>

<p>With RRDtool and RPN, first, define the inputs:</p>

<p>DEF:a=router1.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
DEF:b=router1.rrd:link2in:AVERAGE
DEF:c=router2.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
DEF:d=router3.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
DEF:e=router3.rrd:link2in:AVERAGE</p>

<p>Now, the mathematical function becomes:
&quot;add(a,b,c,d,e)&quot;</p>

<p>In RPN, theres no operator that sums more than two
values so you need to do several additions. You add a and b,
add c to the result, add d to the result and add e to the
result.</p>

<p>push a: a stack contains the value of a push b and add:
b,+ stack contains the result of a+b push c and add: c,+
stack contains the result of a+b+c push d and add: d,+ stack
contains the result of a+b+c+d push e and add: e,+ stack
contains the result of a+b+c+d+e</p>

<p>What was calculated here would be written down as:</p>

<p>( ( ( (a+b) + c) + d) + e) &gt;</p>

<p>This is in RPN:
&quot;CDEF:result=a,b,+,c,+,d,+,e,+&quot;</p>

<p>This is correct but it can be made more clear to humans.
It does not matter if you add a to b and then add c to the
result or first add b to c and then add a to the result.
This makes it possible to rewrite the RPN into
&quot;CDEF:result=a,b,c,d,e,+,+,+,+&quot; which is evaluated
differently:</p>

<p>push value of variable a on the stack: a push value of
variable b on the stack: a b push value of variable c on the
stack: a b c push value of variable d on the stack: a b c d
push value of variable e on the stack: a b c d e push
operator + on the stack: a b c d e + and process it: a b c P
(where P == d+e) push operator + on the stack: a b c P + and
process it: a b Q (where Q == c+P) push operator + on the
stack: a b Q + and process it: a R (where R == b+Q) push
operator + on the stack: a R + and process it: S (where S ==
a+R)</p>

<p>As you can see the RPN expression
&quot;a,b,c,d,e,+,+,+,+,+&quot; will evaluate in
&quot;((((d+e)+c)+b)+a)&quot; and it has the same outcome as
&quot;a,b,+,c,+,d,+,e,+&quot;. This is called the
commutative law of addition, but you may forget this right
away, as long as you remember what it means.</p>

<p>Now look at an expression that contains a
multiplication:</p>

<p>First in normal math: &quot;let result = a+b*c&quot;. In
this case you cant choose the order yourself, you have to
start with the multiplication and then add a to it. You may
alter the position of b and c, you must not alter the
position of a and b.</p>

<p>You have to take this in consideration when converting
this expression into RPN. Read it as: &quot;Add the outcome
of b*c to a&quot; and then it is easy to write the RPN
expression: &quot;result=a,b,c,*,+&quot; Another expression
that would return the same: &quot;result=b,c,*,a,+&quot;</p>

<p>In normal math, you may encounter something like
&quot;a*(b+c)&quot; and this can also be converted into RPN.
The parenthesis just tell you to first add b and c, and then
multiply a with the result. Again, now it is easy to write
it in RPN: &quot;result=a,b,c,+,*&quot;. Note that this is
very similar to one of the expressions in the previous
paragraph, only the multiplication and the addition changed
places.</p>

<p>When you have problems with RPN or when RRDtool is
complaining, its usually a good thing to write down the
stack on a piece of paper and see what happens. Have the
manual ready and pretend to be RRDtool. Just do all the math
by hand to see what happens, Im sure this will solve most,
if not all, problems you encounter.</p>

<p>Some special numbers The unknown value Sometimes
collecting your data will fail. This can be very common,
especially when querying over busy links. RRDtool can be
configured to allow for one (or even more) unknown value(s)
and calculate the missing update. You can, for instance,
query your device every minute. This is creating one so
called PDP or primary data point per minute. If you defined
your RRD to contain an RRA that stores 5-minute values, you
need five of those PDPs to create one CDP (consolidated data
point). These PDPs can become unknown in two cases:</p>

<p>1. The updates are too far apart. This is tuned using
the &quot;heartbeat&quot; setting.</p>

<p>2. The update was set to unknown on purpose by inserting
no value (using the template option) or by using
&quot;U&quot; as the value to insert.</p>

<p>When a CDP is calculated, another mechanism determines
if this CDP is valid or not. If there are too many PDPs
unknown, the CDP is unknown as well. This is determined by
the xff factor. Please note that one unknown counter update
can result in two unknown PDPs! If you only allow for one
unknown PDP per CDP, this makes the CDP go unknown!</p>

<p>Suppose the counter increments with one per second and
you retrieve it every minute:</p>

<p>counter value resulting rate 10&rsquo;000 10&rsquo;060
1; (10&rsquo;060-10&rsquo;000)/60 == 1 10&rsquo;120 1;
(10&rsquo;120-10&rsquo;060)/60 == 1 unknown unknown; you
don&rsquo;t know the last value 10&rsquo;240 unknown; you
don&rsquo;t know the previous value 10&rsquo;300 1;
(10&rsquo;300-10&rsquo;240)/60 == 1</p>

<p>If the CDP was to be calculated from the last five
updates, it would get two unknown PDPs and three known PDPs.
If xff would have been set to 0.5 which by the way is a
commonly used factor, the CDP would have a known value of 1.
If xff would have been set to 0.2 then the resulting CDP
would be unknown.</p>

<p>You have to decide the proper values for heartbeat,
number of PDPs per CDP and the xff factor. As you can see
from the previous text they define the behavior of your
RRA.</p>

<p>Working with unknown data in your database As you have
read in the previous chapter, entries in an RRA can be set
to the unknown value. If you do calculations with this type
of value, the result has to be unknown too. This means that
an expression such as &quot;result=a,b,+&quot; will be
unknown if either a or b is unknown. It would be wrong to
just ignore the unknown value and return the value of the
other parameter. By doing so, you would assume
&quot;unknown&quot; means &quot;zero&quot; and this is not
true.</p>

<p>There has been a case where somebody was collecting data
for over a year. A new piece of equipment was installed, a
new RRD was created and the scripts were changed to add a
counter from the old database and a counter from the new
database. The result was disappointing, a large part of the
statistics seemed to have vanished mysteriously ... They of
course didn t, values from the old database (known values)
were added to values from the new database (unknown values)
and the result was unknown.</p>

<p>In this case, it is fairly reasonable to use a CDEF that
alters unknown data into zero. The counters of the device
were unknown (after all, it wasn t installed yet!) but you
know that the data rate through the device had to be zero
(because of the same reason: it was not installed).</p>

<p>There are some examples below that make this change.</p>

<p>Infinity Infinite data is another form of a special
number. It cannot be graphed because by definition you would
never reach the infinite value. You can think of positive
and negative infinity depending on the position relative to
zero.</p>

<p>RRDtool is capable of representing (-not- graphing!)
infinity by stopping at its current maximum (for positive
infinity) or minimum (for negative infinity) without knowing
this maximum (minimum).</p>

<p>Infinity in RRDtool is mostly used to draw an AREA
without knowing its vertical dimensions. You can think of it
as drawing an AREA with an infinite height and displaying
only the part that is visible in the current graph. This is
probably a good way to approximate infinity and it sure
allows for some neat tricks. See below for examples.</p>

<p>Working with unknown data and infinity Sometimes you
would like to discard unknown data and pretend it is zero
(or any other value for that matter) and sometimes you would
like to pretend that known data is unknown (to discard
known-to-be-wrong data). This is why CDEFs have support for
unknown data. There are also examples available that show
unknown data by using infinity.</p>

<p>Some examples Example: using a recently created RRD You
are keeping statistics on your router for over a year now.
Recently you installed an extra router and you would like to
show the combined throughput for these two devices.</p>

<p>If you just add up the counters from router.rrd and
router2.rrd, you will add known data (from router.rrd) to
unknown data (from router2.rrd) for the bigger part of your
stats. You could solve this in a few ways:</p>

<p>&middot; While creating the new database, fill it with
zeros from the start to now. You have to make the database
start at or before the least recent time in the other
database.</p>

<p>&middot; Alternatively, you could use CDEF and alter
unknown data to zero.</p>

<p>Both methods have their pros and cons. The first method
is troublesome and if you want to do that you have to figure
it out yourself. It is not possible to create a database
filled with zeros, you have to put them in manually.
Implementing the second method is described next:</p>

<p>What we want is: &quot;if the value is unknown, replace
it with zero&quot;. This could be written in pseudo-code as:
if (value is unknown) then (zero) else (value). When reading
the rrdgraph manual you notice the &quot;UN&quot; function
that returns zero or one. You also notice the &quot;IF&quot;
function that takes zero or one as input.</p>

<p>First look at the &quot;IF&quot; function. It takes
three values from the stack, the first value is the decision
point, the second value is returned to the stack if the
evaluation is &quot;true&quot; and if not, the third value
is returned to the stack. We want the &quot;UN&quot;
function to decide what happens so we combine those two
functions in one CDEF.</p>

<p>Lets write down the two possible paths for the
&quot;IF&quot; function:</p>

<p>if true return a if false return b</p>

<p>In RPN: &quot;result=x,a,b,IF&quot; where &quot;x&quot;
is either true or false.</p>

<p>Now we have to fill in &quot;x&quot;, this should be the
&quot;(value is unknown)&quot; part and this is in RPN:
&quot;result=value,UN&quot;</p>

<p>We now combine them: &quot;result=value,UN,a,b,IF&quot;
and when we fill in the appropriate things for &quot;a&quot;
and &quot;b&quot; were finished:</p>

<p>&quot;CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF&quot;</p>

<p>You may want to read Steve Raders RPN guide if you have
difficulties with the way I explained this last example.</p>

<p>If you want to check this RPN expression, just mimic
RRDtool behavior:</p>

<p>For any known value, the expression evaluates as
follows: CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF (value,UN) is not
true so it becomes 0 CDEF:result=0,0,value,IF &quot;IF&quot;
will return the 3rd value CDEF:result=value The known value
is returned</p>

<p>For the unknown value, this happens:
CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF (value,UN) is true so it
becomes 1 CDEF:result=1,0,value,IF &quot;IF&quot; sees 1 and
returns the 2nd value CDEF:result=0 Zero is returned</p>

<p>Of course, if you would like to see another value
instead of zero, you can use that other value.</p>

<p>Eventually, when all unknown data is removed from the
RRD, you may want to remove this rule so that unknown data
is properly displayed.</p>

<p>Example: better handling of unknown data, by using time
The above example has one drawback. If you do log unknown
data in your database after installing your new equipment,
it will also be translated into zero and therefore you wont
see that there was a problem. This is not good and what you
really want to do is:</p>

<p>&middot; If there is unknown data, look at the time that
this sample was taken.</p>

<p>&middot; If the unknown value is before time xxx, make
it zero.</p>

<p>&middot; If it is after time xxx, leave it as unknown
data.</p>

<p>This is doable: you can compare the time that the sample
was taken to some known time. Assuming you started to
monitor your device on Friday September 17, 1999, 00:35:57
MET DST. Translate this time in seconds since 1970-01-01 and
it becomes 937521357. If you process unknown values that
were received after this time, you want to leave them
unknown and if they were &quot;received&quot; before this
time, you want to translate them into zero (so you can
effectively ignore them while adding them to your other
routers counters).</p>

<p>Translating Friday September 17, 1999, 00:35:57 MET DST
into 937521357 can be done by, for instance, using gnu
date:</p>

<p>date -d &quot;19990917 00:35:57&quot; +%s</p>

<p>You could also dump the database and see where the data
starts to be known. There are several other ways of doing
this, just pick one.</p>

<p>Now we have to create the magic that allows us to
process unknown values different depending on the time that
the sample was taken. This is a three step process:</p>

<p>1. If the timestamp of the value is after 937 521 357,
leave it as is.</p>

<p>2. If the value is a known value, leave it as is.</p>

<p>3. Change the unknown value into zero.</p>

<p>Lets look at part one:</p>

<p>if (true) return the original value</p>

<p>We rewrite this:</p>

<p>if (true) return &quot;a&quot; if (false) return
&quot;b&quot;</p>

<p>We need to calculate true or false from step 1. There is
a function available that returns the timestamp for the
current sample. It is called, how surprisingly,
&quot;TIME&quot;. This time has to be compared to a constant
number, we need &quot;GT&quot;. The output of &quot;GT&quot;
is true or false and this is good input to &quot;IF&quot;.
We want &quot;if (time &gt; 937521357) then (return a) else
(return b)&quot;.</p>

<p>This process was already described thoroughly in the
previous chapter so lets do it quick:</p>

<p>if (x) then a else b where x represents
&quot;time&gt;937521357&quot; where a represents the
original value where b represents the outcome of the
previous example</p>

<p>time&gt;937521357 --&gt; TIME,937521357,GT</p>

<p>if (x) then a else b --&gt; x,a,b,IF substitute x --&gt;
TIME,937521357,GT,a,b,IF substitute a --&gt;
TIME,937521357,GT,value,b,IF substitute b --&gt;
TIME,937521357,GT,value,value,UN,0,value,IF,IF</p>

<p>We end up with:
&quot;CDEF:result=TIME,937521357,GT,value,value,UN,0,value,IF,IF&quot;</p>

<p>This looks very complex, however, as you can see, it was
not too hard to come up with.</p>

<p>Example: Pretending weird data ist there Suppose you
have a problem that shows up as huge spikes in your graph.
You know this happens and why, so you decide to work around
the problem. Perhaps youre using your network to do a backup
at night and by doing so you get almost 10mb/s while the
rest of your network activity does not produce numbers
higher than 100kb/s.</p>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<p>1. If the number exceeds 100kb/s it is wrong and you
want it masked out by changing it into unknown.</p>

<p>2. You dont want the graph to show more than
100kb/s.</p>

<p>Pseudo code: if (number &gt; 100) then unknown else
number or Pseudo code: if (number &gt; 100) then 100 else
number.</p>

<p>The second &quot;problem&quot; may also be solved by
using the rigid option of RRDtool graph, however this has
not the same result. In this example you can end up with a
graph that does autoscaling. Also, if you use the numbers to
display maxima they will be set to 100kb/s.</p>

<p>We use &quot;IF&quot; and &quot;GT&quot; again. &quot;if
(x) then (y) else (z)&quot; is written down as
&quot;CDEF:result=x,y,z,IF&quot;; now fill in x, y and z.
For x you fill in &quot;number greater than 100kb/s&quot;
becoming &quot;number,100000,GT&quot; (kilo is 1 000 and b/s
is what we measure!). The &quot;z&quot; part is
&quot;number&quot; in both cases and the &quot;y&quot; part
is either &quot;UNKN&quot; for unknown or &quot;100000&quot;
for 100kb/s.</p>

<p>The two CDEF expressions would be:</p>

<p>CDEF:result=number,100000,GT,UNKN,number,IF
CDEF:result=number,100000,GT,100000,number,IF</p>

<p>Example: working on a certain time span If you want a
graph that spans a few weeks, but would only want to see
some routers data for one week, you need to &quot;hide&quot;
the rest of the time frame. Don t ask me when this would be
useful, its just here for the example :)</p>

<p>We need to compare the time stamp to a begin date and an
end date. Comparing isnt difficult:</p>

<p>TIME,begintime,GE TIME,endtime,LE</p>

<p>These two parts of the CDEF produce either 0 for false
or 1 for true. We can now check if they are both 0 (or 1)
using a few IF statements but, as Wataru Satoh pointed out,
we can use the &quot;*&quot; or &quot;+&quot; functions as
logical AND and logical OR.</p>

<p>For &quot;*&quot;, the result will be zero (false) if
either one of the two operators is zero. For &quot;+&quot;,
the result will only be false (0) when two false (0)
operators will be added. Warning: *any* number not equal to
0 will be considered &quot;true&quot;. This means that, for
instance, &quot;-1,1,+&quot; (which should be &quot;true or
true&quot;) will become FALSE ... In other words, use
&quot;+&quot; only if you know for sure that you have
positive numbers (or zero) only.</p>

<p>Lets compile the complete CDEF:</p>

<p>DEF:ds0=router1.rrd:AVERAGE
CDEF:ds0modified=TIME,begintime,GT,TIME,endtime,LE,*,ds0,UNKN,IF</p>

<p>This will return the value of ds0 if both comparisons
return true. You could also do it the other way around:</p>

<p>DEF:ds0=router1.rrd:AVERAGE
CDEF:ds0modified=TIME,begintime,LT,TIME,endtime,GT,+,UNKN,ds0,IF</p>

<p>This will return an UNKNOWN if either comparison returns
true.</p>

<p>Example: You suspect to have problems and want to see
unknown data. Suppose you add up the number of active users
on several terminal servers. If one of them doesnt give an
answer (or an incorrect one) you get &quot;NaN&quot; in the
database (&quot;Not a Number&quot;) and NaN is evaluated as
Unknown.</p>

<p>In this case, you would like to be alerted to it and the
sum of the remaining values is of no value to you.</p>

<p>It would be something like:</p>

<p>DEF:users1=location1.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
DEF:users2=location1.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
DEF:users3=location2.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
DEF:users4=location2.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
CDEF:allusers=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+</p>

<p>If you now plot allusers, unknown data in one of
users1..users4 will show up as a gap in your graph. You want
to modify this to show a bright red line, not a gap.</p>

<p>Define an extra CDEF that is unknown if all is okay and
is infinite if there is an unknown value:</p>

<p>CDEF:wrongdata=allusers,UN,INF,UNKN,IF</p>

<p>&quot;allusers,UN&quot; will evaluate to either true or
false, it is the (x) part of the &quot;IF&quot; function and
it checks if allusers is unknown. The (y) part of the
&quot;IF&quot; function is set to &quot;INF&quot; (which
means infinity) and the (z) part of the function returns
&quot;UNKN&quot;.</p>

<p>The logic is: if (allusers == unknown) then return INF
else return UNKN.</p>

<p>You can now use AREA to display this
&quot;wrongdata&quot; in bright red. If it is unknown
(because allusers is known) then the red AREA wont show up.
If the value is INF (because allusers is unknown) then the
red AREA will be filled in on the graph at that particular
time.</p>

<p>AREA:allusers#0000FF:combined user count
AREA:wrongdata#FF0000:unknown data</p>

<p>Same example useful with STACKed data: If you use stack
in the previous example (as I would do) then you dont add up
the values. Therefore, there is no relationship between the
four values and you dont get a single value to test. Suppose
users3 would be unknown at one point in time: users1 is
plotted, users2 is stacked on top of users1, users3 is
unknown and therefore nothing happens, users4 is stacked on
top of users2. Add the extra CDEFs anyway and use them to
overlay the &quot;normal&quot; graph:</p>

<p>DEF:users1=location1.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
DEF:users2=location1.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
DEF:users3=location2.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
DEF:users4=location2.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
CDEF:allusers=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+
CDEF:wrongdata=allusers,UN,INF,UNKN,IF
AREA:users1#0000FF:users at ts1 STACK:users2#00FF00:users at
ts2 STACK:users3#00FFFF:users at ts3
STACK:users4#FFFF00:users at ts4
AREA:wrongdata#FF0000:unknown data</p>

<p>If there is unknown data in one of users1..users4, the
&quot;wrongdata&quot; AREA will be drawn and because it
starts at the X-axis and has infinite height it will
effectively overwrite the STACKed parts.</p>

<p>You could combine the two CDEF lines into one (we dont
use &quot;allusers&quot;) if you like. But there are good
reasons for writing two CDEFS:</p>

<p>&middot; It improves the readability of the script.</p>

<p>&middot; It can be used inside GPRINT to display the
total number of users.</p>

<p>If you choose to combine them, you can substitute the
&quot;allusers&quot; in the second CDEF with the part after
the equal sign from the first line:</p>


<p>CDEF:wrongdata=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+,UN,INF,UNKN,IF</p>

<p>If you do so, you wont be able to use these next
GPRINTs:</p>

<p>COMMENT:&quot;Total number of users seen&quot;
GPRINT:allusers:MAX:&quot;Maximum: %6.0lf&quot;
GPRINT:allusers:MIN:&quot;Minimum: %6.0lf&quot;
GPRINT:allusers:AVERAGE:&quot;Average: %6.0lf&quot;
GPRINT:allusers:LAST:&quot;Current: %6.0lf0</p>

<p>The examples from the RRD graph manual page Degrees
Celsius vs. Degrees Fahrenheit To convert Celsius into
Fahrenheit use the formula F=9/5*C+32</p>

LINE2:cel#00a000:&quot;D. Celsius&quot;
LINE2:far#ff0000:&quot;D. Fahrenheit This example gets the
DS called &quot;exhaust&quot; from database
&quot;demo.rrd&quot; and puts the values in variable
&quot;cel&quot;. The CDEF used is evaluated as follows:</p>

<p>CDEF:far=9,5,/,cel,*,32,+ 1. push 9, push 5 2. push
function &quot;divide&quot; and process it the stack now
contains 9/5 3. push variable &quot;cel&quot; 4. push
function &quot;multiply&quot; and process it the stack now
contains 9/5*cel 5. push 32 6. push function
&quot;plus&quot; and process it the stack contains now the
temperature in Fahrenheit</p>

AREA:agginput#00cc00:Input Aggregate
LINE1:aggoutput#0000FF:Output Aggregate</p>

<p>These two CDEFs are built from several functions. It
helps to split them when viewing what they do. Starting with
the first CDEF we would get:</p>

<p>idat1,UN --&gt; a 0 --&gt; b idat1 --&gt; c if (a) then
(b) else (c)</p>

<p>The result is therefore &quot;0&quot; if it is true that
&quot;idat1&quot; equals &quot;UN&quot;. If not, the
original value of &quot;idat1&quot; is put back on the
stack. Lets call this answer &quot;d&quot;. The process is
repeated for the next five items on the stack, it is done
the same and will return answer &quot;h&quot;. The resulting
stack is therefore &quot;d,h&quot;. The expression has been
simplified to &quot;d,h,+,8,*&quot; and it will now be easy
to see that we add &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot;, and
multiply the result with eight.</p>

<p>The end result is that we have added &quot;idat1&quot;
and &quot;idat2&quot; and in the process we effectively
ignored unknown values. The result is multiplied by eight,
most likely to convert bytes/s to bits/s.</p>

STACK:val4#FFC000:Value4 AREA:whipeout#FF0000:Unknown</p>

<p>This demo demonstrates two ways to use infinity. It is a
bit tricky to see what happens in the &quot;background&quot;
CDEF.</p>


<p>&quot;val4,POP,TIME,7200,%,3600,LE,INF,UNKN,IF&quot;</p>

<p>This RPN takes the value of &quot;val4&quot; as input
and then immediately removes it from the stack using
&quot;POP&quot;. The stack is now empty but as a side effect
we now know the time that this sample was taken. This time
is put on the stack by the &quot;TIME&quot; function.</p>

<p>&quot;TIME,7200,%&quot; takes the modulo of time and
7200 (which is two hours). The resulting value on the stack
will be a number in the range from 0 to 7199.</p>

<p>For people who dont know the modulo function: it is the
remainder after an integer division. If you divide 16 by 3,
the answer would be 5 and the remainder would be 1. So,
&quot;16,3,%&quot; returns 1.</p>

<p>We have the result of &quot;TIME,7200,%&quot; on the
stack, lets call this &quot;a&quot;. The start of the RPN
has become &quot;a,3600,LE&quot; and this checks if
&quot;a&quot; is less or equal than &quot;3600&quot;. It is
true half of the time. We now have to process the rest of
the RPN and this is only a simple &quot;IF&quot; function
that returns either &quot;INF&quot; or &quot;UNKN&quot;
depending on the time. This is returned to variable
&quot;background&quot;.</p>

<p>The second CDEF has been discussed earlier in this
document so we wont do that here.</p>

<p>Now you can draw the different layers. Start with the
background that is either unknown (nothing to see) or
infinite (the whole positive part of the graph gets
filled).</p>

<p>Next you draw the data on top of this background, it
will overlay the background. Suppose one of val1..val4 would
be unknown, in that case you end up with only three bars
stacked on top of each other. You don t want to see this
because the data is only valid when all four variables are
valid. This is why you use the second CDEF, it will overlay
the data with an AREA so the data cannot be seen
anymore.</p>

<p>If your data can also have negative values you also need
to overwrite the other half of your graph. This can be done
in a relatively simple way: what you need is the
&quot;wipeout&quot; variable and place a negative sign
before it: &quot;CDEF:wipeout2=wipeout,-1,*&quot;</p>

<p>Filtering data You may do some complex data
filtering:</p>

<p>MEDIAN FILTER: filters shot noise</p>

<p>DEF:var=database.rrd:traffic:AVERAGE
CDEF:prev1=PREV(var) CDEF:prev2=PREV(prev1)
CDEF:prev3=PREV(prev2) CDEF:median=prev1,prev2,prev3,+,+,3,/
LINE3:median#000077:filtered LINE1:prev2#007700:&rsquo;raw
data&rsquo;</p>

<p>DERIVATE:</p>

<p>DEF:var=database.rrd:traffic:AVERAGE
CDEF:prev1=PREV(var) CDEF:time=TIME CDEF:prevtime=PREV(time)
CDEF:derivate=var,prev1,-,time,prevtime,-,/
LINE3:derivate#000077:derivate LINE1:var#007700:&rsquo;raw
data&rsquo;</p>
