<p>NAME ausyscall - a program that allows mapping syscall
names and numbers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ausyscall [arch] name | number | --dump |
--exact</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ausyscall is a program that prints out the
mapping from syscall name to number and reverse for the
given arch. The arch can be anything returned by uname -m.
If arch is not given, the program will take a guess based on
the running image. You may give the syscall name or num- ber
and it will find the opposite. You can also dump the whole
table with the --dump option. By default a syscall name
lookup will be a sub- string match meaning that it will try
to match all occurances of the given name with syscalls. So
giving a name of chown will match both fchown and chown as
any other syscall with chown in its name. If this behavior
is not desired, pass the --exact flag and it will do an
exact string match.</p>

<p>This program can be used to verify syscall numbers on a
biarch platform for rule optimization. For example, suppose
you had an auditctl rule:</p>

<p>-a always, exit -S open -F exit=-EPERM -k fail-open</p>

<p>If you wanted to verify that both 32 and 64 bit programs
would be audited, run &quot;ausyscall i386 open&quot; and
then &quot;ausyscall x86_64 open&quot;. Look at the returned
numbers. If they are different, you will have to write two
auditctl rules to get complete coverage.</p>

<p>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open -F exit=-EPERM -k
fail-open -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -F exit=-EPERM
-k fail-open</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dump Print all syscalls for the given arch</p>

<p>--exact Instead of doing a partial word match, match the
given syscall name exactly.</p>
