<p>NAME create_makefile - Creates Makefile.in and Makefile
from a Makefile.am</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS create_makefile [relativepath/Makefile]
[relativepath]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION create_makefile creates the Makefile.in and
Makefile in a subdirectory containing a Makefile.am. This
script saves time compared to re-running configure
completely</p>

<p>Note that you must supply the path to the desired
Makefile Makefile.am (though the final /Makefile may be
omitted).</p>

<p>This script may be run from the toplevel directory (the
one containing configure) or from one of its
subdirectories.</p>

<p>If the source directory is different from the build
directory (see the environment variables below), it will be
assumed that the Makefile.am and Makefile.in belong beneath
the source directory and that the Make- file belongs beneath
the build directory.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT One of the following variables (but not
both) should be set if the source directory is different
from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a
subdirectory of the source directory, the simpler variable
OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.</p>

<p>OBJ_SUBJDIR Indicates that the build directory is in the
given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if
the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is
kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to
obj-i386-linux.</p>

<p>OBJ_REPLACEMENT A sed expression that is used to
transform the source directory into the build directory. For
instance, if the source directory is ~/src/kdesdk and the
build directory is ~/src/kdesdk-obj, then OBJ_REPLACEMENT
should be set to s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.</p>
