<p>NAME pppoe - user-space PPPoE client.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppd ptypppoe [pppoe_options][pppd_options]</p>

<p>pppoe -A [pppoe_options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pppoe is a user-space client for PPPoE
(Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux and other
UNIX systems. pppoe works in concert with the pppd PPP
daemon to provide a PPP connection over Ethernet, as is used
by many DSL service providers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -I interface The -I option specifies the
Ethernet interface to use. Under Linux, it is typically eth0
or eth1. The interface should be &quot;up&quot; before you
start pppoe, but should not be configured to have an IP
address.</p>

<p>-T timeout The -T option causes pppoe to exit if no
session traffic is detected for timeout seconds. I recommend
that you use this option as an extra safety measure, but if
you do, you should make sure that PPP generates enough
traffic so the timeout will normally not be triggered. The
best way to do this is to use the lcp-echo-interval option
to pppd. You should set the PPPoE timeout to be about four
times the LCP echo interval.</p>

<p>-D file_name The -D option causes every packet to be
dumped to the specified file_name. This is intended for
debugging only; it produces huge amounts of output and
greatly reduces performance.</p>

<p>-V The -V option causes pppoe to print its version
number and exit.</p>

<p>-A The -A option causes pppoe to send a PADI packet and
then print the names of access concentrators in each PADO
packet it receives. Do not use this option in conjunction
with pppd; the -A option is meant to be used interactively
to give interesting information about the access
concentrator.</p>

<p>-S service_name Specifies the desired service name.
pppoe will only initiate sessions with access concentrators
which can provide the speci- fied service. In most cases,
you should not specify this option. Use it only if you know
that there are multiple access concentrators or know that
you need a specific service name.</p>

<p>-C ac_name Specifies the desired access concentrator
name. pppoe will only initiate sessions with the specified
access concentrator. In most cases, you should not specify
this option. Use it only if you know that there are multiple
access concentrators. If both the -S and -C options are
specified, they must both match for pppoe to initiate a
session.</p>

<p>-U Causes pppoe to use the Host-Uniq tag in its
discovery packets. This lets you run multiple pppoe daemons
without having their discovery packets interfere with one
another. You must supply this option to all pppoe daemons if
you intend to run multiple daemons simultaneously.</p>

<p>-s Causes pppoe to use synchronous PPP encapsulation. If
you use this option, then you must use the sync option with
pppd. You are encouraged to use this option if it works,
because it greatly reduces the CPU overhead of pppoe.
However, it MAY be unreliable on slow machines -- there is a
race condition between pppd writing data and pppoe reading
it. For this reason, the default setting is asynchronous. If
you encounter bugs or crashes with Synchronous PPP, turn it
off -- don t e-mail me for support!</p>

<p>-m MSS Causes pppoe to clamp the TCP maximum segment
size at the speci- fied value. Because of PPPoE overhead,
the maximum segment size for PPPoE is smaller than for
normal Ethernet encapsulation. This could cause problems for
machines on a LAN behind a gateway using PPPoE. If you have
a LAN behind a gateway, and the gate- way connects to the
Internet using PPPoE, you are strongly rec- ommended to use
a -m 1412 option. This avoids having to set the MTU on all
the hosts on the LAN.</p>

<p>-p file Causes pppoe to write its process-ID to the
specified file. This can be used to locate and kill pppoe
processes.</p>

<p>-e sess:mac Causes pppoe to skip the discovery phase and
move directly to the session phase. The session is given by
sess and the MAC address of the peer by mac. This mode is
not meant for normal use; it is designed only for
pppoe-server(8).</p>

<p>-n Causes pppoe not to open a discovery socket. This
mode is not meant for normal use; it is designed only for
pppoe-server(8).</p>

<p>-k Causes pppoe to terminate an existing session by
sending a PADT frame, and then exit. You must use the -e
option in conjunction with this option to specify the
session to kill. This may be useful for killing sessions
when a buggy peer does not realize the session has
ended.</p>

<p>-d Causes pppoe to perform discovery and then exit,
after printing session information to standard output. The
session information is printed in exactly the format
expected by the -e option. This option lets you initiate a
PPPoE discovery, perform some other work, and then start the
actual PPP session. Be careful; if you use this option in a
loop, you can create many sessions, which may annoy your
peer.</p>

<p>-f disc:sess The -f option sets the Ethernet frame types
for PPPoE discovery and session frames. The types are
specified as hexadecimal numbers separated by a colon.
Standard PPPoE uses frame types 8863:8864. You should not
use this option unless you are abso- lutely sure the peer
you are dealing with uses non-standard frame types. If your
ISP uses non-standard frame types, com- plain!</p>

<p>-h The -h option causes pppoe to print usage information
and exit.</p>

<p>PPPOE BACKGROUND PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over
Ethernet) is described in RFC 2516 and is a protocol which
allows the session abstraction to be maintained over bridged
Ethernet networks.</p>

<p>PPPoE works by encapsulating PPP frames in Ethernet
frames. The proto- col has two distinct stages: The
discovery and the session stage.</p>

<p>In the discovery stage, the host broadcasts a special
PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation) frame to discover
any access concentra- tors. The access concentrators
(typically, only one access concentra- tor) reply with PADO
(PPPoE Active Discovery Offer) packets, announcing their
presence and the services they offer. The host picks one of
the access concentrators and transmits a PADR (PPPoE Active
Discovery Request) packet, asking for a session. The access
concentrator replies with a PADS (PPPoE Active Discovery
Session-Confirmation) packet. The protocol then moves to the
session stage.</p>

<p>In the session stage, the host and access concentrator
exchange PPP frames embedded in Ethernet frames. The normal
Ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes, but the PPPoE overhead plus two
bytes of overhead for the encap- sulated PPP frame mean that
the MTU of the PPP interface is at most 1492 bytes. This
causes all kinds of problems if you are using a Linux
machine as a firewall and interfaces behind the firewall
have an MTU greater than 1492. In fact, to be safe, I
recommend setting the MTU of machines behind the firewall to
1412, to allow for worst-case TCP and IP options in their
respective headers.</p>

<p>Normally, PPP uses the Link Control Protocol (LCP) to
shut down a PPP link. However, the PPPoE specification
allows the link to be shut down with a special PADT (PPPoE
Active Discovery Terminate) packet. This client recognizes
this packet and will correctly terminate if a termi- nate
request is received for the PPP session.</p>

<p>DESIGN GOALS My design goals for this PPPoE client were
as follows, in descending order of importance:</p>

<p>o It must work.</p>

<p>o It must be a user-space program and not a kernel
patch.</p>

<p>o The code must be easy to read and maintain.</p>

<p>o It must be fully compliant with RFC 2516, the proposed
PPPoE standard.</p>

<p>o It must never hang up forever -- if the connection is
broken, it must detect this and exit, allowing a wrapper
script to restart the connection.</p>

<p>o It must be fairly efficient.</p>

<p>I believe I have achieved all of these goals, but (of
course) am open to suggestions, patches and ideas. See my
home page, http://www.roar- ingpenguin.com, for contact
information.</p>

<p>NOTES For best results, you must give pppd an mtu option
of 1492. I have observed problems with excessively-large
frames unless I set this option. Also, if pppoe is running
on a firewall machine, all machines behind the firewall
should have MTUs of 1412.</p>

<p>If you have problems, check your system logs. pppoe logs
interesting things to syslog. You may have to turn on
logging of debug-level mes- sages for complete
diagnosis.</p>
