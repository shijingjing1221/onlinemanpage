<p>NAME svnadmin - Subversion repository administration
tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS svnadmin command /path/to/repos [options]
[args]</p>

<p>OVERVIEW Subversion is a version control system, which
allows you to keep old versions of files and directories
(usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS. Sub- version
keeps a single copy of the master sources. This copy is
called the source repository; it contains all the
information to permit extracting previous versions of those
files at any time.</p>

<p>For more information about the Subversion project, visit
http://subver- sion.tigris.org.</p>

detailed usage explanations of the svn, svnadmin, svnserve
