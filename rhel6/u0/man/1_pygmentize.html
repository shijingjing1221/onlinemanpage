&lt;filter&gt;[:&lt;options&gt;]] [-f &lt;formatter&gt;] [-O
&lt;options&gt;] [-P &lt;option=value&gt;] [-o
&lt;outfile&gt;] [&lt;infile&gt;] pygmentize -S
&lt;style&gt; -f &lt;format- ter&gt; [-a &lt;arg&gt;] [-O

<p>DESCRIPTION Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for
general use in all kinds of software such as forum systems,
wikis or other applications that need to prettify source
code.</p>

<p>Its highlights are: * a wide range of common languages
and markup formats is supported * special attention is paid
to details, increasing quality by a fair amount * support
for new languages and formats are added easily * a number of
output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX and ANSI sequences *
it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library * ...
and it highlights even Brainfuck!</p>

<p>pygmentize is a command that uses Pygments to highlight
the input file and write the result to &lt;outfile&gt;. If
no &lt;infile&gt; is given, stdin is used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p>-l &lt;lexer&gt; Set the lexer name. If not given, the
lexer is guessed from the extension of the input file name
(this obviously doesnt work if the input is stdin).</p>

<p>-F &lt;filter&gt;[:&lt;options&gt;] Add a filter to the
token stream. You can give options in the same way as for -O
after a colon (note: there must not be spaces around the
colon). This option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>-f &lt;formatter&gt; Set the formatter name. If not
given, it will be guessed from the extension of the output
file name. If no output file is given, the terminal
formatter will be used by default.</p>

<p>-o &lt;outfile&gt; Set output file. If not given, stdout
is used.</p>

<p>-O &lt;options&gt; With this option, you can give the
lexer and formatter a comma- separated list of options, e.g.
&quot;-O bg=light,python=cool&quot;. Which options are valid
for which lexers and formatters can be found in the
documentation. This option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>-P &lt;option=value&gt; This option adds lexer and
formatter options like the -O option, but you can only give
one option per -P. That way, the option value may contain
commas and equals signs, which it cant with -O.</p>

<p>-S &lt;style&gt; Print out style definitions for style
&lt;style&gt; and for formatter &lt;formatter&gt;. The
meaning of the argument given by -a &lt;arg&gt; is formatter
dependent and can be found in the documentation.</p>

<p>-L [&lt;which&gt; ...] List lexers, formatters, styles
or filters. Set &lt;which&gt; to the thing you want to list
(e.g. &quot;styles&quot;), or omit it to list
everything.</p>

<p>-H &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt; Print detailed help for the
object &lt;name&gt; of type &lt;type&gt;, where &lt;type&gt;
is one of &quot;lexer&quot;, &quot;formatter&quot; or
&quot;filter&quot;.</p>

<p>-h Show help screen.</p>

<p>-V Show version of the Pygments package.</p>
