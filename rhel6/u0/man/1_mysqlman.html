<p>NAME mysqlman - default man page for mysql</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Certain executables distributed with the
MySQL database management sys- tem do not have specific man
pages.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO In most cases, you can run the executable from
the command line with a &quot;--help&quot; argument to
display a brief summary of the executables argu- ments and
function. For more information about MySQL, please refer to
the MySQL reference manual, which may already be installed
locally and which is also available online at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en</p>
