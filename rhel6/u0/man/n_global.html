<p>global(n) Tcl Built-In Commands global(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME global - Access global variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS global varname ?varname ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command has no effect unless executed
in the context of a proc body. If the global command is
executed in the context of a proc body, it creates local
variables linked to the corresponding global variables
(though these linked variables, like those created by upvar,
are not included in the list returned by info locals).</p>

<p>If varname contains namespace qualifiers, the local
variables name is the unqualified name of the global
variable, as determined by the namespace tail command.</p>

<p>varname is always treated as the name of a variable, not
an array ele- ment. An error is returned if the name looks
like an array element, such as a(b).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This procedure sets the namespace variable
::a::x proc reset {} { global a::x set x 0 }</p>

<p>This procedure accumulates the strings passed to it in a
global buffer, separated by newlines. It is useful for
situations when you want to build a message piece-by-piece
(as if with puts) but send that full message in a single
piece (e.g. over a connection opened with socket or as part
of a counted HTTP response). proc accum {string} { global
accumulator append accumulator $string }</p>
