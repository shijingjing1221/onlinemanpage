<p>NAME mq_overview - Overview of POSIX message queues</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION POSIX message queues allow processes to
exchange data in the form of messages. This API is distinct
from that provided by System V message queues (msgget(2),
msgsnd(2), msgrcv(2), etc.), but provides similar
functionality.</p>

<p>Message queues are created and opened using mq_open(3);
this function returns a message queue descriptor (mqd_t),
which is used to refer to the open message queue in later
calls. Each message queue is identi- fied by a name of the
form /somename; that is, a null-terminated string of up to
NAME_MAX (i.e., 255) characters consisting of an initial
slash, followed by one or more characters, none of which are
slashes. Two processes can operate on the same queue by
passing the same name to mq_open(3).</p>

<p>Messages are transferred to and from a queue using
mq_send(3) and mq_receive(3). When a process has finished
using the queue, it closes it using mq_close(3), and when
the queue is no longer required, it can be deleted using
mq_unlink(3). Queue attributes can be retrieved and (in some
cases) modified using mq_getattr(3) and mq_setattr(3). A
pro- cess can request asynchronous notification of the
arrival of a message on a previously empty queue using
mq_notify(3).</p>

<p>A message queue descriptor is a reference to an open
message queue description (cf. open(2)). After a fork(2), a
child inherits copies of its parent s message queue
descriptors, and these descriptors refer to the same open
message queue descriptions as the corresponding descriptors
in the parent. Corresponding descriptors in the two pro-
cesses share the flags (mq_flags) that are associated with
the open message queue description.</p>

<p>Each message has an associated priority, and messages
are always deliv- ered to the receiving process highest
priority first. Message priori- ties range from 0 (low) to
sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) - 1 (high). On Linux,
sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) returns 32768, but POSIX.1-2001
only requires an implementation to support priorities in the
range 0 to 31; some implementations only provide this
range.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes some specific
details of the Linux implementation of POSIX message
queues.</p>

<p>Library interfaces and system calls In most cases the
mq_*() library interfaces listed above are imple- mented on
top of underlying system calls of the same name. Deviations
from this scheme are indicated in the following table:</p>

<p>Library interface System call mq_close(3) close(2)
mq_getattr(3) mq_getsetattr(2) mq_notify(3) mq_notify(2)
mq_open(3) mq_open(2) mq_receive(3) mq_timedreceive(2)
mq_send(3) mq_timedsend(2) mq_setattr(3) mq_getsetattr(2)
mq_timedreceive(3) mq_timedreceive(2) mq_timedsend(3)
mq_timedsend(2) mq_unlink(3) mq_unlink(2)</p>

<p>Versions POSIX message queues have been supported on
Linux since kernel 2.6.6. Glibc support has been provided
since version 2.3.4.</p>

<p>Kernel configuration Support for POSIX message queues is
configurable via the CON- FIG_POSIX_MQUEUE kernel
configuration option. This option is enabled by default.</p>

<p>Persistence POSIX message queues have kernel
persistence: if not removed by mq_unlink(3), a message queue
will exist until the system is shut down.</p>

<p>Linking Programs using the POSIX message queue API must
be compiled with cc -lrt to link against the real-time
library, librt.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces The following interfaces can be used to
limit the amount of kernel mem- ory consumed by POSIX
message queues:</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max This file can be used to
view and change the ceiling value for the maximum number of
messages in a queue. This value acts as a ceiling on the
attr-&gt;mq_maxmsg argument given to mq_open(3). The default
and minimum value for msg_max is 10; the upper limit is
HARD_MAX: (131072 / sizeof(void *)) (32768 on Linux/86).
This limit is ignored for privileged processes
(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE), but the HARD_MAX ceiling is nevertheless
imposed.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max This file can be used to
view and change the ceiling on the max- imum message size.
This value acts as a ceiling on the attr-&gt;mq_msgsize
argument given to mq_open(3). The default and minimum value
for msgsize_max is 8192 bytes; the upper limit is INT_MAX
(2147483647 on Linux/86). This limit is ignored for
privileged processes (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/queues_max This file can be used to
view and change the system-wide limit on the number of
message queues that can be created. Only priv- ileged
processes (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) can create new message queues
once this limit has been reached. The default value for
queues_max is 256; it can be changed to any value in the
range 0 to INT_MAX.</p>

<p>Resource limit The RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE resource limit, which
places a limit on the amount of space that can be consumed
by all of the message queues belonging to a processs real
user ID, is described in getrlimit(2).</p>

<p>Mounting the message queue file system On Linux, message
queues are created in a virtual file system. (Other
implementations may also provide such a feature, but the
details are likely to differ.) This file system can be
mounted (by the superuser) using the following commands:</p>

<p># mkdir /dev/mqueue # mount -t mqueue none
/dev/mqueue</p>

<p>The sticky bit is automatically enabled on the mount
directory.</p>

<p>After the file system has been mounted, the message
queues on the sys- tem can be viewed and manipulated using
the commands usually used for files (e.g., ls(1) and
rm(1)).</p>

<p>The contents of each file in the directory consist of a
single line containing information about the queue:</p>

<p>$ cat /dev/mqueue/mymq QSIZE:129 NOTIFY:2 SIGNO:0
NOTIFY_PID:8260</p>

<p>These fields are as follows:</p>

<p>QSIZE Number of bytes of data in all messages in the
queue.</p>

<p>NOTIFY_PID If this is non-zero, then the process with
this PID has used mq_notify(3) to register for asynchronous
message notification, and the remaining fields describe how
notification occurs.</p>

<p>NOTIFY Notification method: 0 is SIGEV_SIGNAL; 1 is
SIGEV_NONE; and 2 is SIGEV_THREAD.</p>

<p>SIGNO Signal number to be used for SIGEV_SIGNAL.</p>

<p>Polling message queue descriptors On Linux, a message
queue descriptor is actually a file descriptor, and can be
monitored using select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7). This is not
portable.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES System V message queues (msgget(2), msgsnd(2),
msgrcv(2), etc.) are an older API for exchanging messages
between processes. POSIX message queues provide a better
designed interface than System V message queues; on the
other hand POSIX message queues are less widely avail- able
(especially on older systems) than System V message
queues.</p>

<p>Linux does not currently (2.6.26) support the use of
access control lists (ACLs) for POSIX message queues.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of various message queue
functions is shown in mq_notify(3).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getrlimit(2), mq_getsetattr(2), poll(2),
select(2), mq_close(3), mq_getattr(3), mq_notify(3),
mq_open(3), mq_receive(3), mq_send(3), mq_unlink(3),
epoll(7)</p>
