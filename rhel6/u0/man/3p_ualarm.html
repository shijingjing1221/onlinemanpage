<p>UALARM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UALARM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ualarm - set the interval timer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>useconds_t ualarm(useconds_t useconds, useconds_t
interval);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ualarm() function shall cause the
SIGALRM signal to be generated for the calling process after
the number of realtime microseconds spec- ified by the
useconds argument has elapsed. When the interval argument is
non-zero, repeated timeout notification occurs with a period
in microseconds specified by the interval argument. If the
notification signal, SIGALRM, is not caught or ignored, the
calling process is ter- minated.</p>

<p>Implementations may place limitations on the granularity
of timer val- ues. For each interval timer, if the requested
timer value requires a finer granularity than the
implementation supports, the actual timer value shall be
rounded up to the next supported value.</p>

<p>Interactions between ualarm() and any of the following
are unspecified:</p>

<p>alarm() nanosleep() setitimer() timer_create()
timer_delete() timer_getoverrun() timer_gettime()
timer_settime() sleep()</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ualarm() function shall return the
number of microseconds remaining from the previous ualarm()
call. If no timeouts are pending or if ualarm() has not
previously been called, ualarm() shall return 0.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications are recommended to use
nanosleep() if the Timers option is supported, or
setitimer(), timer_create(), timer_delete(),
timer_getoverrun(), timer_gettime(), or timer_settime()
instead of this function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
