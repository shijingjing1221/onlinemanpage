<p>CHOWN(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CHOWN(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME chown - change the file ownership</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chown [-hR] owner[:group] file ...</p>

<p>chown -R [-H | -L | -P ] owner[:group] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chown utility shall set the user ID of
the file named by each file operand to the user ID specified
by the owner operand.</p>

<p>For each file operand, or, if the -R option is used,
each file encoun- tered while walking the directory trees
specified by the file operands, the chown utility shall
perform actions equivalent to the chown() func- tion defined
in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
called with the following arguments:</p>

<p>1. The file operand shall be used as the path
argument.</p>

<p>2. The user ID indicated by the owner portion of the
first operand shall be used as the owner argument.</p>

<p>3. If the group portion of the first operand is given,
the group ID indicated by it shall be used as the group
argument; otherwise, the group ownership shall not be
changed.</p>

<p>Unless chown is invoked by a process with appropriate
privileges, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a
regular file shall be cleared upon successful completion;
the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of other file types
may be cleared.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The chown utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-h If the system supports user IDs for symbolic links,
for each file operand that names a file of type symbolic
link, chown shall attempt to set the user ID of the symbolic
link. If the system supports group IDs for symbolic links,
and a group ID was specified, for each file operand that
names a file of type sym- bolic link, chown shall attempt to
set the group ID of the sym- bolic link. If the system does
not support user or group IDs for symbolic links, for each
file operand that names a file of type symbolic link, chown
shall do nothing more with the current file and shall go on
to any remaining files.</p>

<p>-H If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line, chown shall change the user ID (and group ID,
if specified) of the directory referenced by the symbolic
link and all files in the file hierarchy below it.</p>

<p>-L If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line or encountered during the traversal of a file
hierarchy, chown shall change the user ID (and group ID, if
specified) of the directory referenced by the symbolic link
and all files in the file hierarchy below it.</p>

<p>-P If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, chown shall change the owner
ID (and group ID, if specified) of the symbolic link if the
system supports this operation. The chown utility shall not
follow the symbolic link to any other part of the file
hierarchy.</p>

<p>-R Recursively change file user and group IDs. For each
file operand that names a directory, chown shall change the
user ID (and group ID, if specified) of the directory and
all files in the file hierarchy below it. Unless a -H, -L,
or -P option is specified, it is unspecified which of these
options will be used as the default.</p>

<p>Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive
options -H, -L, and -P shall not be considered an error. The
last option specified shall determine the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>owner[:group] A user ID and optional group ID to be
assigned to file. The owner portion of this operand shall be
a user name from the user database or a numeric user ID.
Either specifies a user ID which shall be given to each file
named by one of the file operands. If a numeric owner
operand exists in the user database as a user name, the user
ID number associated with that user name shall be used as
the user ID. Similarly, if the group portion of this operand
is present, it shall be a group name from the group database
or a numeric group ID. Either specifies a group ID which
shall be given to each file. If a numeric group operand
exists in the group database as a group name, the group ID
num- ber associated with that group name shall be used as
the group ID.</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file whose user ID is to be
modified.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of chown:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The utility executed successfully and all requested
changes were made.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Only the owner of a file or the user
with appropriate privileges may change the owner or group of
a file.</p>

<p>Some implementations restrict the use of chown to a user
with appropri- ate privileges.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The System V and BSD versions use different
exit status codes. Some implementations used the exit status
as a count of the number of errors that occurred; this
practice is unworkable since it can overflow the range of
valid exit status values. These are masked by specifying
only 0 and &gt;0 as exit values.</p>

<p>The functionality of chown is described substantially
through refer- ences to functions in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. In this way, there is no
duplication of effort required for describing the
interactions of permissions, multiple groups, and so on.</p>

<p>The 4.3 BSD method of specifying both owner and group
was included in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
because:</p>

<p>* There are cases where the desired end condition could
not be achieved using the chgrp and chown (that only changed
the user ID) utilities. (If the current owner is not a
member of the desired group and the desired owner is not a
member of the current group, the chown() function could fail
unless both owner and group are changed at the same
time.)</p>

<p>* Even if they could be changed independently, in cases
where both are being changed, there is a 100% performance
penalty caused by being forced to invoke both utilities.</p>

<p>The BSD syntax user[. group] was changed to user[:
group] in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 because the
period is a valid character in login names (as specified by
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, login
names consist of characters in the portable filename
character set). The colon character was chosen as the
replace- ment for the period character because it would
never be allowed as a character in a user name or group name
on historical implementations.</p>

<p>The -R option is considered by some observers as an
undesirable depar- ture from the historical UNIX system
tools approach; since a tool, find, already exists to
recurse over directories, there seemed to be no good reason
to require other tools to have to duplicate that function-
ality. However, the -R option was deemed an important user
conve- nience, is far more efficient than forking a separate
process for each element of the directory hierarchy, and is
in widespread historical use.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
