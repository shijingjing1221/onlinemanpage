<p>SDL_LockSurface(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_LockSurface(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_LockSurface - Lock a surface for directly
access.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_LockSurface(SDL_Surface *surface);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_LockSurface sets up a surface for
directly accessing the pixels. Between calls to
SDL_LockSurface and SDL_UnlockSurface, you can write to and
read from surface-&gt;pixels, using the pixel format stored
in sur- face-&gt;format. Once you are done accessing the
surface, you should use SDL_UnlockSurface to release it.</p>

<p>Not all surfaces require locking. If
SDL_MUSTLOCK(surface) evaluates to 0, then you can read and
write to the surface at any time, and the pixel format of
the surface will not change.</p>

<p>No operating system or library calls should be made
between lock/unlock pairs, as critical system locks may be
held during this time.</p>

<p>It should be noted, that since SDL 1.1.8 surface locks
are recursive. This means that you can lock a surface
multiple times, but each lock must have a match unlock.</p>

<p>. . SDL_LockSurface( surface ); . /* Surface is locked
*/ /* Direct pixel access on surface here */ .
SDL_LockSurface( surface ); . /* More direct pixel access on
surface */ . SDL_UnlockSurface( surface ); /* Surface is
still locked */ /* Note: Is versions &lt; 1.1.8, the surface
would have been */ /* no longer locked at this stage */ .
SDL_UnlockSurface( surface ); /* Surface is now unlocked */
. .</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE SDL_LockSurface returns 0, or -1 if the
surface couldnt be locked.</p>
