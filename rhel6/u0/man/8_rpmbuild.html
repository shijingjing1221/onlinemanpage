<p>NAME rpmbuild - Build RPM Package(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS BUILDING PACKAGES: rpmbuild
{-ba|-bb|-bp|-bc|-bi|-bl|-bs} [rpmbuild-options] SPECFILE
...</p>

<p>rpmbuild {-ta|-tb|-tp|-tc|-ti|-tl|-ts}
[rpmbuild-options] TARBALL ...</p>

<p>rpmbuild {--rebuild|--recompile} SOURCEPKG ...</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS: rpmbuild --showrc</p>

<p>rpmbuild-options [--buildroot DIRECTORY] [--clean]
[--nobuild] [--rmsource] [--rmspec] [--short-circuit]
[--sign] [--target PLATFORM]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmbuild is used to build both binary and
source software packages. A package consists of an archive
of files and meta-data used to install and erase the archive
files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Pack- ages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate soft- ware to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected: Build
Package, Build Package from Tarball, Recompile Package, Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>BUILD OPTIONS The general form of an rpm build command
is</p>

<p>rpmbuild -bSTAGE|-tSTAGE [ rpmbuild-options ] FILE
...</p>

<p>The argument used is -b if a spec file is being used to
build the pack- age and -t if rpmbuild should look inside of
a (possibly compressed) tar file for the spec file to use.
After the first argument, the next character (STAGE)
specifies the stages of building and packaging to be done
and is one of:</p>

<p>-ba Build binary and source packages (after doing the
%prep, %build, and %install stages).</p>

<p>-bb Build a binary package (after doing the %prep,
%build, and %install stages).</p>

<p>-bp Executes the &quot;%prep&quot; stage from the spec
file. Normally this involves unpacking the sources and
applying any patches.</p>

<p>-bc Do the &quot;%build&quot; stage from the spec file
(after doing the %prep stage). This generally involves the
equivalent of a &quot;make&quot;.</p>

<p>-bi Do the &quot;%install&quot; stage from the spec file
(after doing the %prep and %build stages). This generally
involves the equiva- lent of a &quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p>-bl Do a &quot;list check&quot;. The &quot;%files&quot;
section from the spec file is macro expanded, and checks are
made to verify that each file exists.</p>

<p>-bs Build just the source package.</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--buildroot DIRECTORY When building a package, override
the BuildRoot tag with direc- tory DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>--clean Remove the build tree after the packages are
made.</p>

<p>--nobuild Do not execute any build stages. Useful for
testing out spec files.</p>

<p>--nodeps Do not verify build dependencies.</p>

<p>--rmsource Remove the sources after the build (may also
be used standalone, e.g. &quot;rpmbuild --rmsource
foo.spec&quot;).</p>

<p>--rmspec Remove the spec file after the build (may also
be used stan- dalone, eg. &quot;rpmbuild --rmspec
foo.spec&quot;).</p>

<p>--short-circuit Skip straight to specified stage (i.e.,
skip all stages leading up to the specified stage). Only
valid with -bc and -bi.</p>

<p>--sign Embed a GPG signature in the package. This
signature can be used to verify the integrity and the origin
of the package. See the section on GPG SIGNATURES in rpm(8)
for configuration details.</p>

<p>--target PLATFORM When building the package, interpret
PLATFORM as arch-vendor-os and set the macros %_target,
%_target_cpu, and %_target_os accordingly.</p>

<p>REBUILD AND RECOMPILE OPTIONS There are two other ways
to invoke building with rpm:</p>

<p>rpmbuild --rebuild|--recompile SOURCEPKG ...</p>

<p>When invoked this way, rpmbuild installs the named
source package, and does a prep, compile and install. In
addition, --rebuild builds a new binary package. When the
build has completed, the build directory is removed (as in
--clean) and the the sources and spec file for the pack- age
are removed.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpmbuild --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpmbuild will use for all of the
options are currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration
file(s).</p>

<p>FILES rpmrc Configuration /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc
/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc /etc/rpmrc ~/.rpmrc</p>

<p>Macro Configuration /usr/lib/rpm/macros
/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros /etc/rpm/macros ~/.rpmmacros</p>

<p>Database /var/lib/rpm/Basenames
/var/lib/rpm/Conflictname /var/lib/rpm/Dirnames
/var/lib/rpm/Filemd5s /var/lib/rpm/Group
/var/lib/rpm/Installtid /var/lib/rpm/Name
/var/lib/rpm/Packages /var/lib/rpm/Providename
/var/lib/rpm/Provideversion /var/lib/rpm/Pubkeys
/var/lib/rpm/Removed /var/lib/rpm/Requirename
/var/lib/rpm/Requireversion /var/lib/rpm/Sha1header
/var/lib/rpm/Sigmd5 /var/lib/rpm/Triggername</p>

<p>Temporary /var/tmp/rpm*</p>

<p>SEE ALSO popt(3), rpm2cpio(8), gendiff(1), rpm(8),</p>

<p>rpmbuild --help - as rpm supports customizing the
options via popt aliases its impossible to guarantee that
whats described in the man- ual matches whats available.</p>
