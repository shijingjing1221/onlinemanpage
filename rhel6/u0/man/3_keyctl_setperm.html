<p>KEYCTL_SETPERM(3) Linux Key Management Calls
KEYCTL_SETPERM(3)</p>

<p>NAME keyctl_setperm - Change the permissions mask on a
key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;</p>

<p>long keyctl_setperm(key_serial_t key, key_perm_t
perm);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION keyctl_setperm() changes the permissions
mask on a key.</p>

<p>A process that does not have the SysAdmin capability may
not change the permissions mask on a key that doesnt have
the same UID as the caller.</p>

<p>The caller must have setattr permission on a key to be
able change its permissions mask.</p>

<p>The permissions mask is a bitwise-OR of the following
flags:</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_VIEW Grant permission to view the attributes of
a key.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_READ Grant permission to read the payload of a
key or to list a keyring.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_WRITE Grant permission to modify the payload of
a key or to add or remove links to/from a keyring.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_SEARCH Grant permission to find a key or to
search a keyring.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_LINK Grant permission to make links to a
key.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_SETATTR Grant permission to change the ownership
and permissions attributes of a key.</p>

<p>KEY_xxx_ALL Grant all the above.</p>

<p>The xxx in the above should be replaced by one of:</p>

<p>POS Grant the permission to a process that possesses the
key (has it attached searchably to one of the process s
keyrings).</p>

<p>USR Grant the permission to a process with the same UID
as the key.</p>

<p>GRP Grant the permission to a process with the same GID
as the key, or with a match for the key s GID amongst that
processs Groups list.</p>

<p>OTH Grant the permission to any other process.</p>

<p>Examples include: KEY_POS_VIEW, KEY_USR_READ,
KEY_GRP_SEARCH and KEY_OTH_ALL.</p>

<p>User, group and other grants are exclusive: if a process
qualifies in the user category, it will not qualify in the
groups category; and if a process qualifies in either user
or groups then it will not qualify in the other
category.</p>

<p>Possessor grants are cumulative with the grants from the
user, groups and other categories.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success keyctl_setperm() returns 0 . On
error, the value -1 will be returned and errno will have
been set to an appropriate error.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOKEY The specified key does not exist.</p>

<p>EKEYEXPIRED The specified key has expired.</p>

<p>EKEYREVOKED The specified key has been revoked.</p>

<p>EACCES The named key exists, but does not grant setattr
permission to the calling process.</p>

<p>LINKING This is a library function that can be found in
libkeyutils. When linking, -lkeyutils should be specified to
the linker.</p>
