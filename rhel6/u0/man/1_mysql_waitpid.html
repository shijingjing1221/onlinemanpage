<p>MYSQL_WAITPID(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_WAITPID(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_waitpid - kill process and wait for its
termination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_waitpid signals a process to terminate
and waits for the process to exit. It uses the kill() system
call and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix-like
systems.</p>

<p>Invoke mysql_waitpid like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time</p>

<p>mysql_waitpid sends signal 0 to the process identified
by pid and waits up to wait_time seconds for the process to
terminate. pid and wait_time must be positive integers.</p>

<p>If process termination occurs within the wait time or
the process does not exist, mysql_waitpid returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns 1.</p>

<p>If the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0,
mysql_waitpid() uses signal 1 instead.</p>

<p>mysql_waitpid supports the following options:</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?, -I</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be
used and signal 1 is used instead.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>
