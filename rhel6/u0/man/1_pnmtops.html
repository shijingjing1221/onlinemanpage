<p>NAME pnmtops - convert PNM image to PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtops [-scale=s] [-dpi=N[xN]] [-imagewidth=n]
[-imageheight=n] [-width=N] [-height=N] [-equalpixels]
[-turn|-noturn] [-rle|-runlength] [-flate] [-ascii85]
[-nocenter] [-nosetpage] [-level=N] [-psfilter]
[-noshowpage] [pnmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtops reads a Netpbm image stream as input and
produces Encapsulated PostScript (EPSF) as output.</p>

<p>If the input file is in color (PPM), pnmtops generates a
color PostScript file. Some PostScript interpreters can t
handle color PostScript. If you have one of these you will
need to run your image through ppmtopgm first.</p>

<p>If you specify no output dimensioning options, the
output image is dimensioned as if you had specified
-scale=1.0, which means aproxi- mately 72 pixels of the
input image generate one inch of output (if that fits the
page).</p>

<p>Use -imagewidth, -imageheight, -equalpixels, -width,
-height, and -scale to adjust that.</p>

<p>Each image in the input stream becomes one complete
one-page Postscript program in the output. (This may not be
the best way to create a multi-page Postscript stream;
someone who knows Postscript should work on this).</p>

<p>The line at the top of the file produced by pnmtops is
either %!PS- Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 or just %!PS-Adobe-3.0 . The
numbers do not reflect the Postscript language level, but
the version of the DSC com- ment specification and EPS
specification implmented. The Postscript language level is
in the &quot;%%LanguageLevel:&quot; comment. pnmtops omits
&quot;EPSF-3.0&quot; if you specify -setpage, because it is
incorrect to claim EPS compliance if the file uses
setpagedevice.</p>

<p>What is Encapsulated Postscript? Encapsulated Postscript
(EPSF) is a subset of Postscript (i.e. the set of streams
that conform to EPSF is a subset of those that conform to
Postscript). It is designed so that an EPSF stream can be
embedded in another Postscript stream. A typical reason to
do that is where an EPSF stream describes a picture you want
in a larger document.</p>

<p>An Encapsulated Postscript document conforms to the DSC
(Document Structuring Convention). The DSC defines some
Postscript comments (theyre comments from a Postscript point
of view, but have semantic value from a DSC point of
view).</p>

<p>More information about Encapsulated Postscript is at
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/docproject/programming/postscript/eps.html
(1).</p>

<p>Many of the ideas in pnmtops come from Dirk Krauses
bmeps. See SEE ALSO</p>

<p>OPTIONS -imagewidth, -imageheight Tells how wide and
high you want the image on the page, in inches. The aspect
ratio of the image is preserved, so if you specify both of
these, the image on the page will be the largest image that
will fit within the box of those dimensions.</p>

<p>If these dimensions are greater than the page size, you
get Postscript output that runs off the page.</p>

<p>You cannot use imagewidth or imageheight with -scale or
-equalpixels.</p>

<p>-equalpixels This option causes the output image to have
the same number of pixels as the input image. So if the
output device is 600 dpi and your image is 3000 pixels wide,
the output image would be 5 inches wide.</p>

<p>You cannot use -equalpixels with -imagewidth,
-imageheight, or -scale.</p>

<p>-scale tells how big you want the image on the page. The
value is the number of inches of output image that you want
72 pixels of the input to generate.</p>

<p>But pnmtops rounds the number to something that is an
integral number of output device pixels. E.g. if the output
device is 300 dpi and you specify -scale=1.0, then 75 (not
72) pixels of input becomes one inch of output (4 output
pixels for each input pixel). Note that the -dpi option
tells pnmtops how many pixels per inch the output device
generates.</p>

<p>If the size so specified does not fit on the page (as
measured either by the -width and -height options or the
default page size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches), pnmtops
ignores the -scale option, issues a warning, and scales the
image to fit on the page.</p>

<p>-dpi=N[xN]</p>

<p>This option specifies the dots per inch resolution of
your out- put device. The default is 300 dpi. In theory
PostScript is device-independent and you don t have to worry
about this, but in practice its raster rendering can have
unsightly bands if the device pixels and the image pixels
arent in sync.</p>

<p>Also this option is crucial to the working of the
equalpixels option.</p>

<p>If you specify NxN, the first number is the horizontal
resolu- tion and the second number is the vertical
resolution. If you specify just a single number N, that is
the resolution in both directions.</p>

<p>-width, -height These options specify the dimensions, in
inches, of the page on which the output is to be printed.
This can affect the size of the output image.</p>

<p>The page size has no effect, however, when you specify
the -imagewidth, -imageheight, or -equalpixels options.</p>

<p>These options may also affect positioning of the image
on the page and even the paper selected (or cut) by the
printer/plotter when the output is printed. See the
-nosetpage option.</p>

<p>The default is 8.5 inches by 11 inches.</p>

<p>-turn</p>

<p>-noturn These options control whether the image gets
turned 90 degrees. Normally, if an image fits the page
better when turned (e.g. the image is wider than it is tall,
but the page is taller than it is wide), it gets turned
automatically to better fit the page. If you specify the
-turn option, pnmtops turns the image no matter what its
shape; If you specify -noturn, pnmtops does not turn it no
matter what its shape.</p>

<p>-rle</p>

<p>-runlength These identical options tell pnmtops to use
run length compres- sion in encoding the image in the
Postscript program. This may save time if the
host-to-printer link is slow; but normally the printers
processing time dominates, so -rle has no effect (and in the
absence of buffering, may make things slower).</p>

<p>This may, however, make the Postscript program
considerable smaller.</p>

<p>This usually doesnt help at all with a color image and
-psfil- ter, because in that case, the Postscript program
pnmtops cre- ates has the red, green, and blue values for
each pixel together, which means you would see long runs of
identical bytes only in the unlikely event that the red,
green, and blue values for a bunch of adjacent pixels are
all the same. But without -psfilter, the Postscript program
has all the red values, then all the green values, then all
the blue values, so long runs appear wherever there are long
stretches of the same color.</p>

<p>-flate This option tells pnmtops to use flate
compression (i.e. com- pression via the Z library -- the
same as PNG).</p>

<p>See the -rle option for information about compression in
gen- eral.</p>

<p>You must specify -psfilter if you specify -flate.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netbpm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), you could not
specify -rle and -flate together.</p>

<p>This sometimes produces what is probably an incorrect
image -- one that is missing the lower rows. This appears to
be an implementation problem in the flate compressor, but we
dont know what it is. We also dont know on which images it
has the problem. (January 2007). We provide an example of an
image with which pnmtops appears to have the problem.
(Convert it to PGM with pngtopam and feed that to
pnmtops).</p>

<p>-ascii85 By default, pnmtops uses asciihex encoding of
the image raster. The image raster is a stream of bits,
while a Postscript program is text, so there has to be an
encoding from bits to text. Asciihex encoding is just the
common hexadecimal representation of bits. E.g. 8 1 bits
would be encoded as the two characters FF.</p>

<p>With the -ascii85 option, pnmtops uses ascii85 encoding
instead. This is an encoding in which 32 bits are encoded
into five characters of text. Thus, it produces less text
for the same raster than asciihex. But ascii85 is not
available in Postscript Level 1, whereas asciihex is.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netbpm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>-psfilter pnmtops can generate two different kinds of
Encapsulated Postscript programs to represent an image. By
default, it gen- erates a program that redefines readstring
in a custom manner and doesnt rely on any built-in
Postscript filters. But with the -psfilter option, pnmtops
leaves readstring alone and uses the built-in Postscript
filters /ASCII85Decode, /ASCIIHexDecode, /RunLengthDecode,
and /FlateDecode.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netbpm 10.27 (March 2005). Before
that, pnmtops always used the custom readstring.</p>

<p>The custom code cant do flate or ascii85 encoding, so
you must use -psfilter if you want those (see -flate,
-ascii85).</p>

<p>-level This option determines the level (version number)
of Postscript that pnmtops uses. By default, pnmtops uses
Level 2. Some fea- tures of pnmtops are available only in
higher Postscript levels, so if you specify too low a level
for your image and your options, pnmtops fails. For example,
pnmtops cannot do a color image in Level 1.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005). Before
that, pnmtops always used Level 2.</p>

<p>-dict This causes the Postscript program create a
separated dictionary for its local variables and remove it
from the stack as it exits.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netbpm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>-vmreclaim This option causes the Postscript program to
force a memory garbage collection as it exits.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netbpm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>-nocenter By default, pnmtops centers the image on the
output page. You can cause pnmtops to instead put the image
against the lower left corner of the page with the -nocenter
option. This is useful for programs which can include
PostScript files, but cant cope with pictures which are not
positioned in the lower left corner.</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, pnmtops accepts the option
-center, but it has no effect.</p>

<p>-setpage This causes pnmtops to include a setpagedevice
directive in the output. This causes the output to violate
specifications of EPSF encapsulated Postscript, but if youre
not using it in an encapsulated way, may be what you need.
The directive tells the printer/plotter what size paper to
use (or cut). The dimensions it specifies on this directive
are those selected by the -width and -height options or
defaulted.</p>

<p>From January through May 2002, the default was to
include setpagedevice and this option did not exist. Before
January 2002, there was no way to include setpagedevice and
neither the -setpage nor -nosetpage option existed.</p>

<p>-nosetpage This tells pnmtops not to include a
setpagedevice directive in the output. This is the default,
so the option has no effect.</p>

<p>See the -setpage option for the history of this
option.</p>

<p>-noshowpage This tells pnmtops not to include a showpage
directive in the output. By default, pnmtops includes a
showpage at the end of the EPSF program According to EPSF
specs, this is OK, and the program that includes the EPSF is
supposed to redefine showpage so this doesnt cause unde-
sirable behavior. But its often easier just not to have the
show- page.</p>

<p>This options was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).
Earlier versions of pnmtops always include the showpage.</p>

<p>-showpage This tells pnmtops to include a showpage
directive at the end of the EPSF output. This is the
default, so the option has no effect.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS If the PNM image has a maxval greater than
255, pnmtops will produce output with 8 bits per sample
resolution unless you specify -psfilter, even though
Postscript Level 2 has a 12 bits per sample format. pnm-
topss custom raster-generating code just doesnt know the 12
bit for- mat.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Postscript is described in the Postscript
Language Reference Manual .</p>

<p>bmeps converts from Netpbm and other formats to
Encapsulated Postscript. It is suitable for hooking up to
dvips so you can include an image in a Latex document just
with an includegraphics directive.</p>

<p>bmeps has a few functions pnmtops does not, such as the
ability to include a transparency mask in the Postscript
program (but not from PAM input -- only from PNG input).</p>
