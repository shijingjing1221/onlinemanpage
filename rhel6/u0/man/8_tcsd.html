<p>TCG Software Stack</p>

<p>NAME tcsd - daemon that manages Trusted Computing
resources</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tcsd [-f]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Trousers is an open-source TCG Software
Stack (TSS), released under the Common Public License.
Trousers aims to be compliant with the current (1.1b) and
upcoming (1.2) TSS specifications available from the Trusted
Computing Group website:
http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.</p>

<p>tcsd is a user space daemon that should be (according to
the TSS spec) the only portal to the TPM device driver. At
boot time, tcsd should be started, it should open the TPM
device driver and from that point on, all requests to the
TPM should go through the TSS stack. The tcsd manages TPM
resources and handles requests from TSPs both local and
remote.</p>

<p>-f run the daemon in the foreground</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL There are two types of access control for
the tcsd, access to the daemons socket itself and access to
specific commands internal to the tcsd. Access to the tcsds
port should be controlled by the system administrator using
firewall rules. If using iptables, the following rule will
allow a specific host access to the tcsd:</p>

<p># iptables -A INPUT -s $IP_ADDRESS -p tcp
--destination-port 30003 -j ACCEPT</p>

<p>Access to individual commands internal to the tcsd is
configured by the tcsd configuration file s
&quot;remote_ops&quot; directive. Each function call in the
TCS API is reachable by a unique ordinal. Each labeled
&quot;remote op&quot; actually defines a set of ordinals
(usually more than one) necessary to accomplish the
operation. So, for example, the &quot;random&quot; operation
enables the ordinals for opening and closing a context,
calling TCS_StirRandom and TCS_GetRandom, as well as
TCS_FreeMemory. By default, connections from localhost will
allow any ordinals.</p>

<p>DATA FILES TSS applications have access to 2 different
kinds of persistant storage. User persistant storage has the
lifetime of that of the application using it and therefore
is destroyed when an application exits. User PS is
controlled by the TSP of the application. System persistent
storage is controlled by the TCS and stays valid across
application lifetimes, tcsd restarts and system resets. Data
registered in system PS stays valid until an application
requests that it be removed. User PS files are by default
stored as /var/tpm/user.{pid} and the system PS file by
default is /var/tpm/system.data. The system PS file is
initially created when ownership of the TPM is first
taken.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION tcsd configuration is stored by default in
/etc/tcsd.conf</p>

<p>DEBUG OUTPUT If TrouSerS has been compiled with
debugging enabled, the debugging output can be supressed by
setting the TSS_DEBUG_OFF environment variable.</p>

<p>DEVICE DRIVERS tcsd is compatible with the IBM Research
TPM device driver available from
http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa and the TPM device
driver available from http://sf.net/projects/tmpdd</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO tcsd conforms to the Trusted Computing
Group Software Specification version 1.1 Golden</p>
