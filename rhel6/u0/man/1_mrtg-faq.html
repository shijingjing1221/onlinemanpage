<p>MRTG-FAQ(1) mrtg MRTG-FAQ(1)</p>

<p>NAME mrtg-faq - How to get help if you have problems
with MRTG</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS MRTG seems to raise a lot of questions. There
are a number of resources apart from the documentation where
you can find help for mrtg.</p>

<p>FAQ In the following sections you ll find some additonal
Frequently Asked Questions, with Answers.</p>

<p>Why is there no &quot;@#$%&quot; (my native language)
version of MRTG?</p>

<p>Nobody has contributed a @#$%.pmd file yet. Go into the
mrtg-2.16.2/translate directory and create your own
translation file. When you are happy with it send it to me
for inclusion with the next mrtg release.</p>

<p>I need a script to make mrtg work with my xyz
device.</p>

<p>Probably this has already been done. Check the stuff in
the mrtg-2.16.2/contrib directory. There is a file called
00INDEX in that directory which tells what you can find in
there.</p>

<p>How does this SNMP thing work</p>

<p>There are many resources on the net that explain SNMP.
Take a look at this article from the Linux Journal by David
Guerrero</p>

<p>http://www.david-guerrero.com/papers/snmp/</p>

<p>And at this rather long document from CISCO.</p>


<p>http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/snmp.htm</p>

<p>The images created by MRTG look very strange.</p>

<p>Remove the *-{week,day,month,year}.png files and start
MRTG again. Using MRTG for the first time, you might have to
do this twice. This will also help when you introduce new
routers into the cfg file.</p>

<p>What is my Community Name?</p>

<p>Ask the person in charge of your Router or try public,
as this is the default Community Name.</p>

<p>My graphs show a flat line during an outage. Why ?</p>

<p>Well, the short answer is that when an SNMP query goes
out and a response doesnt come back, MRTG has to assume
something to put in the graph, and by default it assumes
that the last answer we got back is probably closer to the
truth than zero. This assumption is not perfect (as you have
noticed). Its a trade-off that happens to fail during a
total outage.</p>

<p>If this is an unacceptable trade-off, use the unknaszero
option.</p>

<p>You may want to know what youre trading off, so in the
spirit of trade-offs, heres the long answer:</p>

<p>The problem is that MRTG doesnt know *why* the data
didnt come back, all it knows is that it didnt come back. It
has to do something, and it assumes its a stray lost packet
rather than an outage.</p>

<p>Why dont we always assume the circuit is down and use
zero, which will (we think) be more nearly right? Well, it
turns out that you may be taking advantage of MRTGs
&quot;assume last&quot; behaviour without being aware of
it.</p>

<p>MRTG uses SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to
collect data, and SNMP uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to
ship packets around. UDP is connectionless (not guaranteed)
unlike TCP where packets are tracked and acknowledged and,
if needed, retransmitted. UDP just throws pack- ets at the
network and hopes they arrive. Sometimes they dont.</p>

<p>One likely cause of lost SNMP data is congestion;
another is busy routers. Other possibilities include
transient telecommunications problems, router buffer
overflows (which may or may not be conges- tion-related),
&quot;dirty lines&quot; (links with high error rates), and
acts of God. These things happen all the time; we just don t
notice because many interactive services are TCP-based and
the lost packets get retransmitted automatically.</p>

<p>In the above cases where some SNMP packets are lost but
traffic is flowing, assuming zero is the wrong thing to do -
you end up with a graph that looks like its missing teeth
whenever the link fills up. MRTG interpolates the lost data
to produce a smoother graph which is more accurate in cases
of intermittent packet loss. But with V2.8.4 and above, you
can use the &quot;unknaszero&quot; option to produce
whichever graph is best under the conditions typical for
your network.</p>
