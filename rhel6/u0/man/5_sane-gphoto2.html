<p>sane-gphoto2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-gphoto2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-gphoto2 - SANE backend for gphoto2 supported
cameras</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-gphoto2 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the digital cameras supported by gphoto2. This backend has
only been tested with a handful of cameras so far. Patches
to support other models are welcome.</p>

<p>Because of the limited testing of this backend, it is
commented out in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf by default. Either the
comment character must be removed or the backend must be
called explicitly. E.g. scanimage -d gphoto2 or xscanimage
gphoto2.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES The current version of the backend only
allows one camera to be con- nected. The device name is
always &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the gphoto2.conf specify
the characteristics of the camera to be used. Resolutions
(high resolution, low resolution, and thumbnail size) are
required since they are needed by the sane fron- tends, but
can t be obtained through the gphoto2 interface. Valid ports
and cameras can be obtained by &quot;gphoto2
--list-cameras&quot; and &quot;gphoto2
--list-ports&quot;.</p>

<p>The dumpinquiry line causes some information about the
camera to be printed.</p>

<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>The &quot;topfolder&quot; line specifies the
&quot;fixed&quot; part of the file path. For example, on the
Kodak DC-240, files are stored in the directory
/DCIM/100DC240. The /DCIM portion is constant, but 100DC240
will change and must be read from the camera. In this case,
the line would read &quot;topfolder=/DCIM&quot;</p>

<p>Some cameras dont implement a file structure and store
all pictures in the &quot;/&quot; directory. This is
indicated by setting &quot;subdirs=0&quot; with &quot;top-
folder=/&quot;</p>

<p>port=usb: camera=Kodak DC240 # this is a comment
high_resolution=1280x960 low_resolution=640x480
thumb_resolution=160x120 dumpinquiry</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/gphoto2.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-gphoto2.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-gphoto2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_GPHOTO2 If the library was compiled with
debugging support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. A value of 128
requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>GP_DEBUG Set to 1, 2, or 3, to enable various levels of
debugging within the gphoto2 libraries.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Peter S. Fales</p>

<p>The manpage was largely copied from the dc210
manpage.</p>

<p>BUGS Many, no doubt.</p>

<p>More general comments, suggestions, and inquiries about
frontends or SANE should go to the SANE Developers mailing
list (see http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for
details). You must be subscribed to the list, otherwise your
mail wont be sent to the subscribers.</p>
