<p>NAME fadvise64,fadvise64_64 - Give advice about file
access</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS long fadvise64_64 (int fs, loff_t offset,
loff_t len, int advice, int fs, loff_t offset, loff_t len,
int advice);</p>

<p>long sys_fadvise64 (int fs, loff_t offset, loff_t len,
int advice, int fs, loff_t offset, loff_t len, int
advice);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Allows an application to to tell the kernel
how it expects to use a file handle, so that the kernel can
choose appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques for
access to the corresponding file. This is simi- lar to the
POSIX version of the madvise system call, but for file ac-
cess instead of memory access. The sys_fadvise64() function
is obsolete and corresponds to a broken glibc API,
sys_fadvise64_64() is the fixed version. The following are
the values for the advice parameter:</p>

<p>FADV_NORMAL No special treatment.</p>

<p>FADV_RANDOM Expect page references in random order.</p>

<p>FADV_SEQUENTIAL Expect page references in sequential
order.</p>

<p>FADV_WILLNEED Expect access in the near future.</p>

<p>FADV_DONTNEED Do not expect access in the near future.
Subsequent access of pages in this range will succeed, but
will result either in reloading of the memory contents from
the underlying mapped file or zero-fill-in-demand pages for
mappings without an underlying file.</p>

<p>FADV_NOREUSE Access data only once.</p>

<p>ERRORS -EBADF An invalid file descriptor was specified.
to modify the modules.</p>

<p>-EINVAL An invalid f_mapping of file, len value smaller
than 0 or advice value unknown.</p>
