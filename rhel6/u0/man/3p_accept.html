<p>ACCEPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ACCEPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME accept - accept a new connection on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict
address, socklen_t *restrict address_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The accept() function shall extract the
first connection on the queue of pending connections, create
a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address
family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file
descriptor for that socket.</p>

<p>The accept() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies a socket that was created with
socket(), has been bound to an address with bind(), and has
issued a successful call to listen().</p>

<p>address Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a
sockaddr structure where the address of the connecting
socket shall be returned.</p>

<p>address_len Points to a socklen_t structure which on
input specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr
structure, and on output speci- fies the length of the
stored address.</p>

<p>If address is not a null pointer, the address of the
peer for the accepted connection shall be stored in the
sockaddr structure pointed to by address, and the length of
this address shall be stored in the object pointed to by
address_len.</p>

<p>If the actual length of the address is greater than the
length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored
address shall be truncated.</p>

<p>If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients,
and the peer is not bound, then the value stored in the
object pointed to by address is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the listen queue is empty of connection requests and
O_NONBLOCK is not set on the file descriptor for the socket,
accept() shall block until a connection is present. If the
listen() queue is empty of con- nection requests and
O_NONBLOCK is set on the file descriptor for the socket,
accept() shall fail and set errno to [EAGAIN] or
[EWOULDBLOCK].</p>

<p>The accepted socket cannot itself accept more
connections. The original socket remains open and can accept
more connections.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, accept() shall
return the non-negative file descriptor of the accepted
socket. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The accept() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket file descriptor and no
connec- tions are present to be accepted.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNABORTED</p>

<p>A connection has been aborted.</p>

<p>EINTR The accept() function was interrupted by a signal
that was caught before a valid connection arrived.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket is not accepting connections.</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum number of file descriptors in the
system are already open.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket type of the specified socket does
not support accept- ing connections.</p>

<p>The accept() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOBUFS No buffer space is available.</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory available to
complete the opera- tion.</p>

<p>EPROTO A protocol error has occurred; for example, the
STREAMS protocol stack has not been initialized.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE When a connection is available,
select() indicates that the file descriptor for the socket
is ready for reading.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
