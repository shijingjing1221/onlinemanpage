<p>NAME sisusb - SiS USB video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;sisusb&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sisusb is an Xorg driver for SiS (Silicon
Integrated Systems) video chips that are connected via a
Net2280-based USB dongle. The driver is not accelerated, but
provides support for colordepths of 8, 16 and 24 bpp as well
as Render and other extensions.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The sisusb driver supports USB video
cards based on the following chipsets:</p>

<p>SiS315E/PRO</p>

<p>The SiS315E/PRO features two CRT controllers. However,
in its USB ver- sion, only the first output, referred to as
&quot;CRT1&quot;, is being used.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and to sis(4) for more
information. This manpage only covers a subset of the
supported options.</p>

<p>Detailed information on all supported options can be
obtained at
http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisusbvga.shtml</p>

<p>Please note that this driver requires a Linux kernel
driver as well which is included in Linux 2.6.12 and later,
as well as available at the aforementioned website.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the hardware cursor. It is not recommended to
disable the hardware cursor as this will increase the amount
of data transferred over the USB. Default: HWCursor is
on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; The
opposite of HWCursor. This enables or disables the software
cursor. This sort of cursor is slower because the pointer
must be painted into the graphics display. This increases
the amount of data transferred over the USB significantly.
Default: SWCur- sor is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT1Gamma&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable gamma correction. Default: Gamma correction is
on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisconnectTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
This option determines how the driver will react to a
disconnec- tion of the USB device. If the integer supplied
is -1, the driver will abort the X server immediately upon
disconnection. If the value given is 0, the driver will
probe for a re-connec- tion every 2 seconds and in case the
device is detected, re- establish the display. If the value
is greater than 0, the driver will do this re-probing within
the given number of sec- onds and abort the server if it
does not detect the device within this time-out. Default: 0
(probe forever for device reconnection).</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS none.</p>
