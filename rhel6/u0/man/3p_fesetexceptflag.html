<p>FEGETEXCEPTFLAG(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FEGETEXCEPTFLAG(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fegetexceptflag, fesetexceptflag - get and set
floating-point status flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts); int
fesetexceptflag(const fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fegetexceptflag() function shall attempt
to store an implementa- tion-defined representation of the
states of the floating-point status flags indicated by the
argument excepts in the object pointed to by the argument
flagp.</p>

<p>The fesetexceptflag() function shall attempt to set the
floating-point status flags indicated by the argument
excepts to the states stored in the object pointed to by
flagp. The value pointed to by flagp shall have been set by
a previous call to fegetexceptflag() whose second argument
represented at least those floating-point exceptions repre-
sented by the argument excepts. This function does not raise
floating- point exceptions, but only sets the state of the
flags.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the representation was successfully
stored, fegetexceptflag() shall return zero. Otherwise, it
shall return a non-zero value. If the excepts argument is
zero or if all the specified exceptions were suc- cessfully
set, fesetexceptflag() shall return zero. Otherwise, it
shall return a non-zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
