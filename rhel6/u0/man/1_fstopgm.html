<p>NAME fstopgm - convert a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file into
a PGM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fstopgm [fsfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>fstopgm reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as input and
produces a PGM image as output.</p>

<p>FaceSaver(tm) files sometimes have rectangular pixels.
While fstopgm won t re-scale them into square pixels for
you, it will give you the precise pamscale command that will
do the job. Because of this, read- ing a FaceSaver(tm) image
is a two-step process. First you do:</p>

<p>fstopgm &gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>This will tell you whether you need to use pamscale.</p>

<p>Then use one of the following pipelines: fstopgm |
pgmnorm fstopgm | pamscale -whatever | pgmnorm</p>

<p>To go to PBM, you want something more like one of these:
fstopgm | pamenlarge 3 | pgmnorm | pamditherbw fstopgm |
pamenlarge 3 | pamscale &lt;whatever&gt; | pgmnorm |
pamditherbw</p>

<p>You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap because
otherwise you lose information; but enlarging by more than 3
does not look good.</p>
