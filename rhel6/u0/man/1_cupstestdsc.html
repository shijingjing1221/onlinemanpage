<p>NAME cupstestdsc - test conformance of postscript
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cupstestdsc [ -h ] filename.ps [ ...
filenameN.ps ] cupstestdsc [ -h ] -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cupstestdsc tests the conformance of
PostScript files to the Adobe PostScript Language Document
Structuring Conventions Specification ver- sion 3.0. The
results of testing and any other output are sent to the
standard output. The second form of the command reads
PostScript from the standard input.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS cupstestdsc only validates the DSC comments
in a PostScript file and does not attempt to validate the
PostScript code itself. Developers must ensure that the
PostScript they generate follows the rules defined by Adobe.
Specifically, all pages must be independent of each other,
code outside page descriptions may not affect the graphics
state (cur- rent font, color, transform matrix, etc.), and
device-specific commands such as setpagedevice should not be
used.</p>
