<p>NAME acct - process accounting file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/acct.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the kernel is built with the process
accounting option enabled (CON- FIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT), then
calling acct(2) starts process accounting, for example:</p>

<p>acct(&quot;/var/log/pacct&quot;);</p>

<p>When process accounting is enabled, the kernel writes a
record to the accounting file as each process on the system
terminates. This record contains information about the
terminated process, and is defined in &lt;sys/acct.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>#define ACCT_COMM 16</p>

<p>typedef u_int16_t comp_t;</p>

<p>struct acct { char ac_flag; /* Accounting flags */
u_int16_t ac_uid; /* Accounting user ID */ u_int16_t ac_gid;
/* Accounting group ID */ u_int16_t ac_tty; /* Controlling
terminal */ u_int32_t ac_btime; /* Process creation time
(seconds since the Epoch) */ comp_t ac_utime; /* User CPU
time */ comp_t ac_stime; /* System CPU time */ comp_t
ac_etime; /* Elapsed time */ comp_t ac_mem; /* Average
memory usage (kB) */ comp_t ac_io; /* Characters transferred
(unused) */ comp_t ac_rw; /* Blocks read or written (unused)
*/ comp_t ac_minflt; /* Minor page faults */ comp_t
ac_majflt; /* Major page faults */ comp_t ac_swaps; /*
Number of swaps (unused) */ u_int32_t ac_exitcode; /*
Process termination status (see wait(2)) */ char
ac_comm[ACCT_COMM+1]; /* Command name (basename of last
executed command; null-terminated) */ char ac_pad[X]; /*
padding bytes */ };</p>

<p>enum { /* Bits that may be set in ac_flag field */ AFORK
= 0x01, /* Has executed fork, but no exec */ ASU = 0x02, /*
Used superuser privileges */ ACORE = 0x08, /* Dumped core */
AXSIG = 0x10 /* Killed by a signal */ };</p>

<p>The comp_t data type is a floating-point value
consisting of a 3-bit, base-8 exponent, and a 13-bit
mantissa. A value, c, of this type can be converted to a
(long) integer as follows:</p>

<p>v = (c &amp; 0x1fff) &lt;&lt; (((c &gt;&gt; 13) &amp;
0x7) * 3);</p>

<p>The ac_utime, ac_stime, and ac_etime fields measure time
in &quot;clock ticks&quot;; divide these values by
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to convert them to seconds.</p>

<p>Version 3 Accounting File Format Since kernel 2.6.8, an
optional alternative version of the accounting file can be
produced if the CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3 option is set
when building the kernel. With this option is set, the
records written to the accounting file contain additional
fields, and the width of c_uid and ac_gid fields is widened
from 16 to 32 bits (in line with the increased size of UID
and GIDs in Linux 2.4 and later). The records are defined as
follows:</p>

<p>struct acct_v3 { char ac_flag; /* Flags */ char
ac_version; /* Always set to ACCT_VERSION (3) */ u_int16_t
ac_tty; /* Controlling terminal */ u_int32_t ac_exitcode; /*
Process termination status */ u_int32_t ac_uid; /* Real user
ID */ u_int32_t ac_gid; /* Real group ID */ u_int32_t
ac_pid; /* Process ID */ u_int32_t ac_ppid; /* Parent
process ID */ u_int32_t ac_btime; /* Process creation time
*/ float ac_etime; /* Elapsed time */ comp_t ac_utime; /*
User CPU time */ comp_t ac_stime; /* System time */ comp_t
ac_mem; /* Average memory usage (kB) */ comp_t ac_io; /*
Characters transferred (unused) */ comp_t ac_rw; /* Blocks
read or written (unused) */ comp_t ac_minflt; /* Minor page
faults */ comp_t ac_majflt; /* Major page faults */ comp_t
ac_swaps; /* Number of swaps (unused) */ char
ac_comm[ACCT_COMM]; /* Command name */ };</p>

<p>VERSIONS The acct_v3 structure is defined in glibc since
version 2.6.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Process accounting originated on BSD.
Although it is present on most systems, it is not
standardized, and the details vary somewhat between
systems.</p>

<p>NOTES Records in the accounting file are ordered by
termination time of the process.</p>

<p>In kernels up to and including 2.6.9, a separate
accounting record is written for each thread created using
the NPTL threading library; since Linux 2.6.10, a single
accounting record is written for the entire pro- cess on
termination of the last thread in the process.</p>

<p>The proc/sys/kernel/acct file, described in proc(5),
defines settings that control the behavior of process
accounting when disk space runs low.</p>
