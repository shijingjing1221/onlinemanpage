<p>MKLOST+FOUND(8) MKLOST+FOUND(8)</p>

<p>NAME mklost+found - create a lost+found directory on a
mounted Linux second extended file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mklost+found</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mklost+found is used to create a lost+found
directory in the current working directory on a Linux second
extended file system. There is normally a lost+found
directory in the root directory of each filesys- tem.</p>

<p>mklost+found pre-allocates disk blocks to the lost+found
directory so that when e2fsck(8) is being run to recover a
filesystem, it does not need to allocate blocks in the
filesystem to store a large number of unlinked files. This
ensures that e2fsck will not have to allocate data blocks in
the filesystem during recovery.</p>

<p>OPTIONS There are none.</p>

<p>AUTHOR mklost+found has been written by Remy Card
&lt;Remy.Card@linux.org&gt;. It is currently being
maintained by Theodore Ts o &lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS There are none :-)</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY mklost+found is part of the e2fsprogs
package and is available from
http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net.</p>
