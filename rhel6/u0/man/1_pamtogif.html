<p>NAME pamtogif - convert a Netpbm image to a GIF
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtogif</p>

<p>[-interlace]</p>

<p>[-sort]</p>

<p>[-mapfile=mapfile] [-transparent=[=]color]</p>

<p>[-alphacolor=color]</p>

<p>[-comment=text]</p>

<p>[-nolzw]</p>

<p>[-aspect=fraction]</p>

<p>[-verbose] [netpbmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtogif reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a
GIF file as out- put.</p>

<p>This program creates only individual GIF images. To
combine multiple GIF images into an animated GIF, use
gifsicle (not part of the Netpbm package).</p>

<p>pamtogif creates either an original GIF87 format GIF
file or the newer GIF89 format. It creates GIF89 when you
request features that were new with GIF89, to wit the
-transparent or -comment options. Otherwise, it creates
GIF87. Really old GIF readers conceivably could not
recognize GIF89.</p>

<p>The GIF format is not capable of representing an image
with more than 256 colors in it (it contains a color map
with a maximum size of 256). If the image you want to
convert has more colors than that (ppmhist can tell you),
you can use pnmquant to reduce it to 256.</p>

<p>If your input image is a PAM with transparency
information, ppmtogif uses one entry in the GIF colormap
specifically for the transparent pixels, so you can have at
most 255 opaque colors. In contrast, if you use the
-transparent option, one of the colors from the input
becomes transparent, so the limit is still 256.</p>

<p>pamtogif was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). In
older Netpbm, use ppmtogif.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -interlace Produce an interlaced GIF file.</p>

<p>-sort Produce a GIF file with a color map sorted in a
predictable order.</p>

<p>This does not produce the sorted color map which is part
of the GIF format. That kind of sorted color map is one
where the col- ors are sorted according to how important
they are, and the GIF header tells the viewer that it is
sorted that way. Its purpose is to allow the viewer to use
fewer colors than are in the color map if it is not capable
of displaying all the colors.</p>

<p>What this option produces is a color map sorted by red
value, then green, then blue. That can be useful in
analyzing GIF images, particularly those made with two
versions of the pro- gram, because it removes some of the
variability.</p>

<p>-mapfile=mapfile</p>

<p>Use the colors found in the file mapfile to create the
colormap in the GIF file, instead of the colors from
netpbmfile. mapfile can be any PPM file; all that matters is
the colors in it. If the colors in netpbmfile do not match
those in mapfile, pamtogif matches them to a best match. You
can obtain a much better result by using pnmremap to change
the colors in the input to those in the map file.</p>

<p>The mapfile file is not a palette file, just an image
whose col- ors you want to use. The order of colors in the
GIF palette have nothing to do with where they appear in the
mapfile image, and duplication of colors in the image is
irrelevant.</p>

<p>The map files depth must match the number of color
components in the input (which is not necessarily the same
as the inputs depth -- the input might have an alpha plane
in addition). If your map file does not, or it might not,
run your input through pnmremap using the same map file so
that it does.</p>

<p>-transparent=color pamtogif marks the specified color as
transparent in the GIF image.</p>

<p>If you don t specify -transparent, pamtogif does not
mark any color transparent (except as indicated by the
transparency information in the input file).</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>If the color you specify is not present in the image,
pamtogif selects instead the color in the image that is
closest to the one you specify. Closeness is measured as a
cartesian distance between colors in RGB space. If multiple
colors are equidis- tant, pamtogif chooses one of them
arbitrarily.</p>

<p>However, if you prefix your color specification with =,
e.g. -transparent==red, only the exact color you specify
will be transparent. If that color does not appear in the
image, there will be no transparency. pamtogif issues an
information message when this is the case.</p>

<p>When you specify -transparent, pamtogif ignores explicit
trans- parency information (the alpha channel) in the input
image.</p>

<p>-alpha=pgmfile There is no -alpha option. pamtogif s
predecessor had such an option because it was not capable of
taking PAM input that contains a transparency (alpha) plane,
so one used this option to supply a transparency plane as a
separate PGM file.</p>

<p>This option names a PGM file that contains an alpha mask
for the image. pamtogif creates fully transparent pixels
wherever the alpha mask indicates transparency greater than
50%. The color of those pixels is that specified by the
-alphacolor option, or black by default.</p>

<p>To do this, pamtogif creates an entry in the GIF
colormap in addition to the entries for colors that are
actually in the image. It marks that colormap entry as
transparent and uses that colormap index in the output image
to create a transparent pixel.</p>

<p>The alpha image must be the same dimensions as the input
image, but may have any maxval. White means opaque and black
means transparent.</p>

<p>You cannot specify both -transparent and -alpha.</p>

<p>-alphacolor=color This specifies the foreground color
for transparent pixels. A viewer may use the foreground
color for a transparent pixel if it chooses not to have
another color show through.. The default is black.</p>

<p>This applies only to pixels that are transparent in the
GIF because they are transparent in the Netpbm input. If a
GIF pixel is transparent because of the -transparent option,
the foreground color is the color indicated by that
option.</p>

<p>Note that in GIF, all transparent pixels have the same
fore- ground color. (There is only one entry in the GIF
colormap for transparent pixels).</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>-comment=text Include a comment in the GIF output with
comment text text.</p>

<p>Without this option, there are no comments in the
output.</p>

<p>Note that in a command shell, you ll have to use
quotation marks around text if it contains characters (e.g.
space) that would make the shell think it is multiple
arguments: $ pamtogif -comment &quot;this is a comment&quot;
&lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif</p>

<p>-nolzw</p>

<p>This option is mainly of historical interest -- it
involves use of a patent that is now expired.</p>

<p>This option causes the GIF output, and thus pamtogif,
not to use LZW (Lempel-Ziv) compression. As a result, the
image file is larger and, before the patent expired, no
royalties would be owed to the holder of the patent on LZW.
See the section LICENSE below.</p>

<p>LZW is a method for combining the information from
multiple pix- els into a single GIF code. With the -nolzw
option, pamtogif creates one GIF code per pixel, so it is
not doing any compres- sion and not using LZW. However, any
GIF decoder, whether it uses an LZW decompressor or not,
will correctly decode this uncompressed format. An LZW
decompressor would see this as a particular case of LZW
compression.</p>

<p>Note that if someone uses an LZW decompressor such as
the one in giftopnm or pretty much any graphics display
program to process the output of pamtogif -nolzw , he is
then using the LZW patent. But the patent holder expressed
far less interest in enforcing the patent on decoding than
on encoding.</p>

<p>-aspect=fraction This is the aspect ratio of the pixels
of the image. Its only effect is to record that information
in the GIF for use by what- ever interprets the GIF. Note
that this feature of GIF is hardly ever used and most GIF
decoders ignore this information and assume pixels are
square.</p>

<p>Pixels in a Netpbm image do not have aspect ratios;
there is always a one-one correspondence between GIF pixels
and Netpbm pixels.</p>

<p>The aspect ratio is the quotient of width divided by
height. GIF allows aspect ratios from 0.25 (1:4) to 4 (4:1)
in incre- ments of 1/64. pamtogif implements a natural
extension of GIF that allows an aspect ratio up to 4 14/64.
If you specify any- thing outside this range, pamtogif
fails. pamtogif rounds frac- tion to the nearest 1/64.</p>

<p>The default is square (1.0).</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). Before
that, the pixels are always square.</p>

<p>-verbose This option causes pamtogif to display
information about the conversion process and the image it
produces.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtogif was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December
2006). It replaced ppm- togif, which created GIF images for
Pbmplus/Netpbm users since 1989.</p>

<p>The main outward change in the conversion from ppmtogif
to pamtogif was that pamtogif was able to use transparency
information ( alpha chan- nel ) in PAM input, whereas with
ppmtogif, one had to supply the trans- parency mask in a
separate pseudo-PGM image (via the -alpha option).</p>

<p>Jef Poskanzer wrote ppmtogif in 1989, and it has always
been a corner- stone of Pbmplus/Netpbm because GIF is such a
popular image format. Jef based the LZW encoding on GIFENCOD
by David Rowley &lt;mgardi@watd- csu.waterloo.edu&gt;. Jef
included GIFENCODs GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.
Rowley, in turn, adapted the LZW compression code from
classic Unix compress, which used techniques described in
IEEE Computer, June 1984.</p>

<p>Jef s ppmtogif notably lacked the ability to use a
transparency mask with it. You could create transparent
pixels in a GIF, but only with the -transparent option,
which allowed one to specify that all pixels of a certain
color in the input were to be transparent. Bryan Hender- son
added the -alpha option in July 2001 so you could supply a
mask image that indicates exactly which pixels are to be
transparent, and those pixels could have the same color as
other opaque ones.</p>

<p>Bryan Henderson added another significant piece of code
and function in October 2001: the ability to generate a GIF
without using the LZW patent -- an uncompressed GIF. This
was very important to many people at the time because the
GIF patent was still in force, and this allowed them to make
an image that any GIF viewer could display, royalty-free.
Bryan adapted code from the Independent Jpeg Groups djpeg
for that.</p>

<p>There is no code in pamtogif from Jefs original, but Jef
may still hold copyright over it due to the way in which it
evolved. Virtually all of the code in pamtogif was written
by Bryan Henderson and con- tributed to the public
domain.</p>

<p>LICENSE If you use pamtogif without the -nolzw option,
you are using a patent on the LZW compression method which
is owned by Unisys. The patent has expired (in 2003 in the
US and in 2004 elsewhere), so it doesnt mat- ter. While the
patent was in force, most people who used pamtogif and
similar programs did so without a license from Unisys to do
so. Unisys typically asked $5000 for a license for trivial
use of the patent. Unisys never enforced the patent against
trivial users.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that IBM also owns or owned a patent
covering pamtogif.</p>

<p>A replacement for the GIF format that never required any
patents to use is the PNG format.</p>
