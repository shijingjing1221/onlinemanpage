<p>XSetInputFocus(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSetInputFocus(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetInputFocus, XGetInputFocus - control input
focus</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetInputFocus(Display *display, Window
focus, int revert_to, Time time);</p>

<p>int XGetInputFocus(Display *display, Window
*focus_return, int *revert_to_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>focus Specifies the window, PointerRoot, or None.</p>

<p>focus_return Returns the focus window, PointerRoot, or
None.</p>

<p>revert_to Specifies where the input focus reverts to if
the window becomes not viewable. You can pass
RevertToParent, RevertTo- PointerRoot, or RevertToNone.</p>

<p>revert_to_return Returns the current focus state
(RevertToParent, RevertTo- PointerRoot, or
RevertToNone).</p>

<p>time Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp
or Cur- rentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetInputFocus function changes the
input focus and the last-focus- change time. It has no
effect if the specified time is earlier than the current
last-focus-change time or is later than the current X server
time. Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the
spec- ified time (CurrentTime is replaced by the current X
server time). XSetInputFocus causes the X server to generate
FocusIn and FocusOut events.</p>

<p>Depending on the focus argument, the following
occurs:</p>

<p>&middot; If focus is None, all keyboard events are
discarded until a new focus window is set, and the revert_to
argument is ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; If focus is a window, it becomes the keyboards
focus window. If a generated keyboard event would normally
be reported to this win- dow or one of its inferiors, the
event is reported as usual. Oth- erwise, the event is
reported relative to the focus window.</p>

<p>&middot; If focus is PointerRoot, the focus window is
dynamically taken to be the root window of whatever screen
the pointer is on at each keyboard event. In this case, the
revert_to argument is ignored.</p>

<p>The specified focus window must be viewable at the time
XSetInputFocus is called, or a BadMatch error results. If
the focus window later becomes not viewable, the X server
evaluates the revert_to argument to determine the new focus
window as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If revert_to is RevertToParent, the focus
reverts to the parent (or the closest viewable ancestor),
and the new revert_to value is taken to be RevertToNone.</p>

<p>&middot; If revert_to is RevertToPointerRoot or
RevertToNone, the focus reverts to PointerRoot or None,
respectively. When the focus reverts, the X server generates
FocusIn and FocusOut events, but the last-focus-change time
is not affected.</p>

<p>XSetInputFocus can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XGetInputFocus function returns the focus window and
the current focus state.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
