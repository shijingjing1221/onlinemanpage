<p>NAME rawtoppm - convert a stream of raw RGB bytes to a
PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rawtoppm</p>

<p>[-headerskip N]</p>

<p>[-rowskip N]</p>

<p>[ -rgb|-rbg|-grb |-gbr|-brg|-bgr ]</p>

<p>[-interpixel|-interrow] width height</p>

<p>[imagedata]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>rawtoppm reads raw RGB bytes as input and produces a PPM
image as out- put. The input file is just RGB bytes. You
have to specify the width and height on the command line,
since the program obviously cant get them from the file.
rawtoppm assumes the maxval of the input samples is 255, and
makes the maxval of the output PPM 255.</p>

<p>rawtoppm assumes the pixels come top first in the input
stream. If they are actually bottom first, the resulting PPM
is upside down, so run it through pamflip -tb.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -headerskip Skip over this many bytes at the
beginning of the input stream. Use this option when the
input has some kind of header followed by a raster suitable
for rawtoppm.</p>

<p>-rowskip Skip this many bytes at the end of each row of
the raster. (Some input streams have padding at the end of
rows).</p>

<p>-rgb -rbg -grb -gbr -brg -bgr This option specifies the
order of the color components for each pixel. The default is
-rgb.</p>

<p>-interpixel -interrow These options specify how the
colors are interleaved. The default is -interpixel, meaning
interleaved by pixel. A byte of red, a byte of green, and a
byte of blue, or whatever color order you specified.
-interrow means interleaved by row - a row of red, a row of
green, a row of blue, assuming standard rgb color order. An
-interplane option - all the red pixels, then all the green,
then all the blue - would be an obvious exten- sion, but is
not implemented. You could get the same effect by splitting
the file into three parts (perhaps using dd), turning each
part into a PGM file with rawtopgm, and then combining them
with rgb3toppm.</p>
