<p>IPSEC_SPIGRP(5) 27 Jun 2000 IPSEC_SPIGRP(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_spigrp - list IPSEC Security Association
groupings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec spigrp cat/proc/net/ipsec_spigrp</p>

<p>OBSOLETE Note that spigrp is only supported on the
classic KLIPS stack. It is not supported on any other stack
and will be completely removed in future versions. A
replacement command still needs to be designed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp is a read-only file
that lists groups of IPSEC Security Associations (SAs).</p>

<p>An entry in the IPSEC extended routing table can only
point (via an SAID) to one SA. If more than one transform
must be applied to a given type of packet, this can be
accomplished by setting up several SAs with the same
destination address but potentially different SPIs and
protocols, and grouping them with ipsec_spigrp(8).</p>

<p>The SA groups are listed, one line per connection/group,
as a sequence of SAs to be applied (or that should have been
applied, in the case of an incoming packet) from inside to
outside the packet. An SA is identified by its SAID, which
consists of protocol (&quot;ah&quot;, &quot;esp&quot;,
&quot;comp&quot; or &quot;tun&quot;), SPI (with
&acute;.&acute; for IPv4 or &acute;:&acute; for IPv6
prefixed hexadecimal number ) and destination address (IPv4
dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex) prefixed by
&acute;@&acute;, in the format
&lt;proto&gt;&lt;af&gt;&lt;spi&gt;@&lt;dest&gt;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES tun.3d0@192.168.2.110 comp.3d0@192.168.2.110
esp.187a101b@192.168.2.110 ah.187a101a@192.168.2.110</p>

<p>is a group of 3 SAs, destined for 192.168.2.110 with an
IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first with an SPI of 3d0 in
hexadecimal, followed by a Deflate compression header to
compress the packet with CPI of 3d0 in hexadecimal, followed
by an Encapsulating Security Payload header to encrypt the
packet with SPI 187a101b in hexadecimal, followed by an
Authentication Header to authenticate the packet with SPI
187a101a in hexadecimal, applied from inside to outside the
packet. This could be an incoming or outgoing group,
depending on the address of the local machine.</p>

<p>tun:3d0@3049:1::2 comp:3d0@3049:1::2
esp:187a101b@3049:1::2 ah:187a101a@3049:1::2</p>

<p>is a group of 3 SAs, destined for 3049:1::2 with an
IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel SA applied first with an SPI of 3d0 in
hexadecimal, followed by a Deflate compression header to
compress the packet with CPI of 3d0 in hexadecimal, followed
by an Encapsulating Security Payload header to encrypt the
packet with SPI 187a101b in hexadecimal, followed by an
Authentication Header to authenticate the packet with SPI
187a101a in hexadecimal, applied from inside to outside the
packet. This could be an incoming or outgoing group,
depending on the address of the local machine.</p>
