<p>SGP_DD(8) SG3_UTILS SGP_DD(8)</p>

<p>NAME sgp_dd - copies data to and from files and devices.
Specialized for devices that understand the SCSI command
set.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgp_dd [bs=BS] [count=COUNT] [ibs=BS]
[if=IFILE] [iflag=FLAGS] [obs=BS] [of=OFILE] [oflag=FLAGS]
[seek=SEEK] [skip=SKIP] [--help] [--version]</p>

<p>[bpt=BPT] [coe=0|1] [cdbsz=6|10|12|16] [deb=VERB]
[dio=0|1] [sync=0|1] [thr=THR] [time=0|1] [verbose=VERB]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Copy data to and from any files. Specialised
for &quot;files&quot; that are Linux SCSI generic (sg) and
raw devices. Similar syntax and semantics to dd(1) but does
not perform any conversions. Uses POSIX threads to increase
the amount of parallelism. This improves speed in some
cases.</p>

<p>The first group in the synopsis above are
&quot;standard&quot; Unix dd(1) operands. The second group
are extra options added by this utility. Both groups are
defined below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS bpt=BPT each IO transaction will be made using
BPT blocks (or less if near the end of the copy). Default is
128 for block sizes less that 2048 bytes, otherwise the
default is 32. So for bs=512 the reads and writes will each
convey 64 KiB of data by default (less if near the end of
the transfer or memory restrictions). When cd/dvd drives are
accessed, the block size is typically 2048 bytes and bpt
defaults to 32 which again implies 64 KiB transfers.</p>

<p>bs=BS where BS must be the block size of the physical
device. Note that this differs from dd(1) which permits bs
to be an inte- gral multiple of the actual device block
size. Default is 512 which is usually correct for disks but
incorrect for cdroms (which normally have 2048 byte
blocks).</p>

<p>cdbsz=6 | 10 | 12 | 16 size of SCSI READ and/or WRITE
commands issued on sg device names. Default is 10 byte SCSI
command blocks (unless calcula- tions indicate that a 4 byte
block number may be exceeded, in which case it defaults to
16 byte SCSI commands).</p>

<p>coe=0 | 1 set to 1 for continue on error. Only applies
to errors on sg devices. Thus errors on other files will
stop sgp_dd. Default is 0 which implies stop on any error.
See the coe flag for more information.</p>

<p>count=COUNT copy COUNT blocks from IFILE to OFILE.
Default is the minimum (of IFILE and OFILE) number of blocks
that sg devices report from SCSI READ CAPACITY commands or
that block devices (or their partitions) report. Normal
files are not probed for their size. If skip=SKIP or
skip=SEEK are given and the count is deduced (i.e. not
explicitly given) then that count is scaled back so that the
copy will not overrun the device. If the file name is a
block device partition and COUNT is not given then the size
of the partition rather than the size of the whole device is
used. If COUNT is not given and cannot be deduced then an
error mes- sage is issued and no copy takes place.</p>

<p>deb=VERB outputs debug information. If VERB is 0
(default) then there is minimal debug information and as
VERB increases so does the amount of debug (max debug output
when VERB is 9).</p>

<p>dio=0 | 1 default is 0 which selects indirect IO. Value
of 1 attempts direct IO which, if not available, falls back
to indirect IO and notes this at completion. If direct IO is
selected and /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio has the value of 0 then
a warning is issued (and indirect IO is performed) For finer
grain control use iflag=dio or oflag=dio.</p>

<p>ibs=BS if given must be the same as BS given to bs=
option.</p>

<p>if=IFILE read from IFILE instead of stdin. If IFILE is -
then stdin is read. Starts reading at the beginning of IFILE
unless SKIP is given.</p>

<p>iflag=FLAGS where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one
or more flags out- lined below. These flags are associated
with IFILE and are ignored when IFILE is stdin.</p>

<p>obs=BS if given must be the same as BS given to bs=
option.</p>

<p>of=OFILE write to OFILE instead of stdout. If OFILE is -
then writes to stdout. If OFILE is /dev/null then no actual
writes are per- formed. If OFILE is . (period) then it is
treated the same way as /dev/null (this is a shorthand
notation). If OFILE exists then it is _not_ truncated; it is
overwritten from the start of OFILE unless oflag=append or
SEEK is given.</p>

<p>oflag=FLAGS where FLAGS is a comma separated list of one
or more flags out- lined below. These flags are associated
with OFILE and are ignored when OFILE is /dev/null, .
(period), or stdout.</p>

<p>seek=SEEK start writing SEEK bs-sized blocks from the
start of OFILE. Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p>skip=SKIP start reading SKIP bs-sized blocks from the
start of IFILE. Default is block 0 (i.e. start of file).</p>

<p>sync=0 | 1 when 1, does SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command on
OFILE at the end of the transfer. Only active when OFILE is
a sg device file name.</p>

<p>thr=THR where THR is the number or worker threads
(default 4) that attempt to copy in parallel. Minimum is 1
and maximum is 16.</p>

<p>time=0 | 1 when 1, the transfer is timed and throughput
calculation is per- formed, outputting the results (to
stderr) at completion. When 0 (default) no timing is
performed.</p>

<p>verbose=VERB increase verbosity. Same as deb=VERB. Added
for compatibility with sg_dd and sgm_dd.</p>

<p>--help outputs usage message and exits.</p>

<p>--version outputs version number information and
exits.</p>

<p>FLAGS Here is a list of flags and their meanings:</p>

<p>append causes the O_APPEND flag to be added to the open
of OFILE. For normal files this will lead to data appended
to the end of any existing data. Cannot be used together
with the seek=SEEK option as they conflict. The default
action of this utility is to overwrite any existing data
from the beginning of the file or, if SEEK is given,
starting at block SEEK. Note that attempt- ing to append to
a device file (e.g. a disk) will usually be ignored or may
cause an error to be reported.</p>

<p>coe continue on error. When given with iflag=, an error
that is detected in a single SCSI command (typically bpt
blocks) is noted (by an error message sent to stderr), then
zeros are sub- stituted into the buffer for the
corresponding write operation and the copy continues. Note
that the sg_dd utility is more sophisticated in such error
situations when iflag=coe. When given with oflag=, any error
reported by a SCSI WRITE command is reported to stderr and
the copy continues (as if nothing went wrong).</p>

<p>dio request the sg device node associated with this flag
does direct IO. If direct IO is not available, falls back to
indirect IO and notes this at completion. If direct IO is
selected and /proc/scsi/sg/allow_dio has the value of 0 then
a warning is issued (and indirect IO is performed).</p>

<p>direct causes the O_DIRECT flag to be added to the open
of IFILE and/or OFILE. This flag requires some memory
alignment on IO. Hence user memory buffers are aligned to
the page size. Has no effect on sg, normal or raw files.</p>

<p>dpo set the DPO bit (disable page out) in SCSI READ and
WRITE com- mands. Not supported for 6 byte cdb variants of
READ and WRITE. Indicates that data is unlikely to be
required to stay in device (e.g. disk) cache. May speed
media copy and/or cause a media copy to have less impact on
other device users.</p>

<p>dsync causes the O_SYNC flag to be added to the open of
IFILE and/or OFILE. The d is prepended to lower confusion
with the sync=0|1 option which has another action (i.e. a
synchronisa- tion to media at the end of the transfer).</p>

<p>excl causes the O_EXCL flag to be added to the open of
IFILE and/or OFILE.</p>

<p>fua causes the FUA (force unit access) bit to be set in
SCSI READ and/or WRITE commands. This only has effect with
sg devices. The 6 byte variants of the SCSI READ and WRITE
commands do not sup- port the FUA bit. Only active for sg
device file names.</p>

<p>null has no affect, just a placeholder.</p>

<p>RETIRED OPTIONS Here are some retired options that are
still present:</p>

<p>coe=0 | 1 continue on error is 0 (off) by default. When
it is 1, it is equivalent to iflag=coe oflag=coe described
in the FLAGS sec- tion above. Similar to conv=noerror,sync
in dd(1) utility. Default is 0 which implies stop on error.
More advanced coe=1 processing on reads is performed by the
sg_dd utility.</p>

<p>fua=0 | 1 | 2 | 3 force unit access bit. When 3, fua is
set on both IFILE and OFILE; when 2, fua is set on IFILE;,
when 1, fua is set on OFILE; when 0 (default), fua is
cleared on both. See the fua flag.</p>

<p>NOTES A raw device must be bound to a block device prior
to using sgp_dd. See raw(8) for more information about
binding raw devices. To be safe, the sg device mapping to
SCSI block devices should be checked with cat
/proc/scsi/scsi before use.</p>

<p>Raw device partition information can often be found with
fdisk(8) [the &quot;-ul&quot; argument is useful in this
respect].</p>

<p>Various numeric arguments (e.g. SKIP) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p>The COUNT, SKIP and SEEK arguments can take 64 bit
values (i.e. very big numbers). Other values are limited to
what can fit in a signed 32 bit number.</p>

<p>Data usually gets to the user space in a 2 stage
process: first the SCSI adapter DMAs into kernel buffers and
then the sg driver copies this data into user memory (write
operations reverse this sequence). This is called
&quot;indirect IO&quot; and there is a dio option to select
&quot;direct IO&quot; which will DMA directly into user
memory. Due to some issues &quot;direct IO&quot; is disabled
in the sg driver and needs a configuration change to
activate it.</p>

<p>All informative, warning and error output is sent to
stderr so that dds output file can be stdout and remain
unpolluted. If no options are given, then the usage message
is output and nothing else happens.</p>

<p>Why use sgp_dd? Because in some cases it is twice as
fast as dd (mainly with sg devices, raw devices give some
improvement). Another reason is that big copies fill the
block device caches which has a negative impact on other
machine activity.</p>

<p>SIGNALS The signal handling has been borrowed from dd:
SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGPIPE output the number of remaining
blocks to be trans- ferred and the records in + out counts;
then they have their default action. SIGUSR1 causes the same
information to be out- put yet the copy continues. All
output caused by signals is sent to stderr.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Looks quite similar in usage to dd:</p>

<p>sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=t bs=512 count=1MB</p>

<p>This will copy 1 million 512 byte blocks from the device
associ- ated with /dev/sg0 (which should have 512 byte
blocks) to a file called t. Assuming /dev/sda and /dev/sg0
are the same device then the above is equivalent to:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/sda of=t bs=512 count=1000000</p>

<p>although dds speed may improve if bs was larger and
count was correspondingly scaled. Using a raw device to do
something simi- lar on a ATA disk:</p>

<p>raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hda sgp_dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=t
bs=512 count=1MB</p>

<p>To copy a SCSI disk partition to an ATA disk
partition:</p>

<p>raw /dev/raw/raw2 /dev/hda3 sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0
skip=10123456 of=/dev/raw/raw2 bs=512</p>

<p>This assumes a valid partition is found on the SCSI disk
at the given skip block address (past the 5 GB point of that
disk) and that the partition goes to the end of the SCSI
disk. An explicit count is probably a safer option.</p>

<p>To do a fast copy from one SCSI disk to another one with
similar geometry (stepping over errors on the source
disk):</p>

<p>sgp_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=/dev/sg1 bs=512 coe=1</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sgp_dd is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page. Since
this utility works at a higher level than individual
commands, and there are coe and retries flags, individual
SCSI command failures do not neces- sary cause the process
to exit.</p>
