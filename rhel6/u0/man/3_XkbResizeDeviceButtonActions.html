<p>XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions - Allocate additional
space for button actions in an XkbDeviceInfoRec
structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions
(XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, unsigned int new_total);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - device_info structure in which to allocate
button actions</p>

<p>- new_total new total number of button actions
needed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions reallocates
space, if necessary, to make sure there is room for a total
of new_total button actions in the device_info structure.
Any new entries allocated are zeroed. If suc- cessful,
XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions returns Success. If new_total
is zero, all button actions are deleted,
device_info-&gt;num_btns is set to zero, and
device_info-&gt;btn_acts is set to NULL. If device_info is
invalid or new_total is greater than 255, BadValue is
returned. If a memory allocation failure occurs, a BadAlloc
is returned.</p>

<p>To free an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, use
XkbFreeDeviceInfo.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Information about X Input Extension devices
is transferred between a client program and the Xkb
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { char * name; / name for device */ Atom
type; / name for class of devices */ unsigned short
device_spec; / device of interest */ Bool has_own_state; /
True=&gt;this device has its own state */ unsigned short
supported; / bits indicating supported capabilities */
unsigned short unsupported; / bits indicating unsupported
capabilities */ unsigned short num_btns; / number of entries
in btn_acts */ XkbAction * btn_acts; / button actions */
unsigned short sz_leds; / total number of entries in LEDs
vector */ unsigned short num_leds; / number of valid entries
in LEDs vector */ unsigned short dflt_kbd_fb; / input
extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */ unsigned
short dflt_led_fb; / input extension ID of default indicator
feedback */ XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr leds; / LED descriptions */
} XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
