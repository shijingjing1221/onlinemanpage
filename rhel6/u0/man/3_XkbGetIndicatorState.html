<p>XkbGetIndicatorState(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetIndicatorState(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetIndicatorState - Obtains the current state of
the keyboard indi- cators</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetIndicatorState (Display *display,
unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int state_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - display connection to the X server</p>

<p>- device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>- state_return backfilled with a mask of the indicator
state</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb allows applications to obtain
information about indicators using two different methods.
The first method, which is similar to the core X
implementation, uses a mask to specify the indicators. The
second method, which is more suitable for applications
concerned with interop- erability, uses indicator names. The
correspondence between the indica- tor name and the bit
position in masks is as follows: one of the param- eters
returned from XkbGetNamedIndicators is an index that is the
bit position to use in any function call that requires a
mask of indicator bits, as well as the indicator s index
into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.</p>

<p>XkbGetIndicatorState queries the display for the state
of the indica- tors on the device specified by the
device_spec. For each indicator that is &quot;turned
on&quot; on the device, the associated bit is set in
state_return. If a compatible version of the Xkb extension
is not available in the server, XkbGetIndicatorState returns
a BadMatch error. Otherwise, it sends the request to the X
server, places the state of the indicators into
state_return, and returns Success. Thus the value reported
by XkbGetIndicatorState is identical to the value reported
by the core protocol.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not
available in the server or an argument has correct type and
range, but is otherwise invalid</p>
