<p>SNMPTRAPD.CONF(5) Net-SNMP SNMPTRAPD.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME snmptrapd.conf - configuration file for the
Net-SNMP notification receiver</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Net-SNMP notification receiver (trap
daemon) uses one or more con- figuration files to control
its operation and how incoming traps (and INFORM requests)
should be processed. This file (snmptrapd.conf) can be
located in one of several locations, as described in the
snmp_con- fig(5) manual page.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT Previously, snmptrapd would accept all
incoming notifications, and log them automatically (even if
no explicit configuration was provided). Starting with
release 5.3, access control checks will be applied to
incoming notifications. If snmptrapd is run without a
suitable configu- ration file (or equivalent access control
settings), then such traps WILL NOT be processed. See the
section ACCESS CONTROL for more details.</p>

<p>As with the agent configuration, the snmptrapd.conf
directives can be divided into four distinct groups.</p>

<p>TRAPD BEHAVIOUR snmpTrapdAddr
[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;[,...]
defines a list of listening addresses, on which to receive
incoming SNMP notifications. See the section LISTENING
ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information
about the format of listening addresses.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to listen on UDP port 162 on
all IPv4 interfaces.</p>

<p>doNotRetainNotificationLogs yes disables support for the
NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB. Normally the snmptrapd program keeps a
record of the traps received, which can be retrieved by
querying the nlmLogTable and nlmLogvari- ableTable tables.
This directive can be used to suppress this behaviour.</p>

<p>See the snmptrapd(8) manual page and the
NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB for details.</p>

<p>doNotLogTraps yes disables the logging of notifications
altogether. This is use- ful if the snmptrapd application
should only run traphandle hooks and should not log traps to
any location.</p>

<p>doNotFork yes do not fork from the calling shell.</p>

<p>pidFile PATH defines a file in which to store the
process ID of the notifica- tion receiver. By default, this
ID is not saved.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL Starting with release 5.3, it is
necessary to explicitly specify who is authorised to send
traps and informs to the notification receiver (and what
types of processing these are allowed to trigger). This uses
an extension of the VACM model, used in the main SNMP
agent.</p>

<p>There are currently three types of processing that can
be specified:</p>

<p>log log the details of the notification - either in a
speci- fied file, to standard output (or stderr), or via
syslog (or similar).</p>

<p>execute pass the details of the trap to a specified
handler pro- gram, including embedded perl.</p>

<p>net forward the trap to another notification
receiver.</p>

<p>In the following directives, TYPES will be a
(comma-separated) list of one or more of these tokens. Most
commonly, this will typically be log,execute,net to cover
any style of processing for a particular cate- gory of
notification. But it is perfectly possible (even desirable)
to limit certain notification sources to selected processing
only.</p>

<p>authCommunity TYPES COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -v VIEW ]]
authorises traps (and SNMPv2c INFORM requests) with the
speci- fied community to trigger the types of processing
listed. By default, this will allow any notification using
this community to be processed. The SOURCE field can be used
to specify that the configuration should only apply to
notifications received from particular sources - see
snmpd.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p>authUser TYPES [-s MODEL] USER [LEVEL [OID | -v VIEW ]]
authorises SNMPv3 notifications with the specified user to
trig- ger the types of processing listed. By default, this
will accept authenticated requests. (authNoPriv or
authPriv). The LEVEL field can be used to allow
unauthenticated notifications (noauth), or to require
encryption (priv), just as for the SNMP agent.</p>

<p>With both of these directives, the OID (or -v VIEW)
field can be used to retrict this configuration to the
processing of particu- lar notifications.</p>

<p>Note: Unlike the VACM processing described in RFC 3415,
this view is only matched against the snmpTrapOID value of
the incoming notification. It is not applied to the payload
varbinds held within that notification.</p>

<p>authGroup TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP [LEVEL [OID | -v VIEW
]]</p>

<p>authAccess TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP VIEW [LEVEL
[CONTEXT]]</p>

<p>setAccess GROUP CONTEXT MODEL LEVEL PREFIX VIEW TYPES
authorise notifications in the specified GROUP (configured
using the group directive) to trigger the types of
processing listed. See snmpd.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p>createUser username (MD5|SHA) authpassphrase [DES|AES]
See the snmpd.conf(5) manual page for a description of how
to create SNMPv3 users. This is roughly the same, but the
file name changes to snmptrapd.conf from snmpd.conf.</p>

<p>disableAuthorization yes will disable the above access
control checks, and revert to the previous behaviour of
accepting all incoming notifications.</p>

<p>LOGGING format1 FORMAT</p>

<p>format2 FORMAT specify the format used to display SNMPv1
TRAPs and SNMPv2 noti- fications respectively. Note that
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 both use the same SNMPv2 PDU format.</p>

<p>See snmptrapd(8) for the layout characters
available.</p>

<p>ignoreAuthFailure yes instructs the receiver to ignore
authenticationFailure traps.</p>

<p>Note: This currently only affects the logging of such
notifica- tions. authenticationFailure traps will still be
passed to trap handler scripts, and forwarded to other
notifica- tion receivers. This behaviour should not be
relied on, as it is likely to change in future versions.</p>

<p>logOption string specifies where notifications should be
logged - to standard output, standard error, a specified
file or via syslog. See the section LOGGING OPTIONS in the
snmpcmd(1) manual page for details.</p>

<p>outputOption string specifies various characteristics of
how OIDs and other values should be displayed. See the
section OUTPUT OPTIONS in the snm- pcmd(1) manual page for
details.</p>

<p>MySQL Logging There are two configuration variables that
work together to control when queued traps are logged to the
MySQL database. A non-zero value must be specified for
sqlSaveInterval to enable MySQL logging.</p>

<p>sqlMaxQueue max specifies the maximum number of traps to
queue before a forced flush to the MySQL database.</p>

<p>sqlSaveInterval seconds specified the number of seconds
between periodic queue flushes. A value of 0 for will
disable MySQL logging.</p>

<p>NOTIFICATION PROCESSING As well as logging incoming
notifications, they can also be forwarded on to another
notification receiver, or passed to an external program for
specialised processing.</p>

<p>traphandle OID|default PROGRAM [ARGS ...] invokes the
specified program (with the given arguments) when- ever a
notification is received that matches the OID token. For
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 notifications, this token will be
compared against the snmpTrapOID value taken from the
notification. For SNMPv1 traps, the generic and specific
trap values and the enterprise OID will be converted into
the equivalent OID (fol- lowing RFC 2576).</p>

<p>Typically, the OID token will be the name (or numeric
OID) of a NOTIFICATION-TYPE object, and the specified
program will be invoked for notifications that match this
OID exactly. However this token also supports a simple form
of wildcard suffixing. By appending the character
notification based within subtree rooted at the specified
OID. For example, an OID token of .1.3.6.1.4.1* would match
any enterprise specific notification (including the
specified OID itself). An OID token of .1.3.6.1.4.1.* would
would work in much the same way, but would not match this
exact OID - just notifications that lay strictly below this
root. Note that this syntax does not support full regular
expressions or wildcards - an OID token of the form
oid.*.subids is not valid.</p>

<p>If the OID field is the token default then the program
will be invoked for any notification not matching another
(OID specific) traphandle entry.</p>

<p>Details of the notification are fed to the program via
its standard input. Note that this will always use the
SNMPv2-style notification format, with SNMPv1 traps being
converted as per RFC 2576, before being passed to the
program. The input format is as follows, one entry per
line:</p>

<p>HOSTNAME The name of the host that sent the
notification, as determined by gethostbyaddr(3).</p>

<p>IPADDRESS The IP address of the host that sent the
notification.</p>

<p>VARBINDS A list of variable bindings describing the
contents of the notification, one per line. The first token
on each line (up until a space) is the OID of the varind,
and the remainder of the line is its value. The format of
both of these are controlled by the outputOption directive
(or similar configuration).</p>

<p>The first OID should always be SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0,
and the second should be SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0. The
remaining lines will contain the payload varbind list. For
SNMPv1 traps, the final OID will be
SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0.</p>

<p>Example: A traptoemail script has been included in the
Net-SNMP package that can be used within a traphandle
directive:</p>

<p>traphandle default /usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/traptoemail -s
mysmtp.somewhere.com -f admin@somewhere.com me@some-
where.com</p>

<p>forward OID|default DESTINATION forwards notifications
that match the specified OID to another receiver listening
on DESTINATION. The interpretation of OID (and default) is
the same as for the traphandle directive).</p>

<p>See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8)
manual page for more information about the format of
listening addresses.</p>

<p>NOTES o The daemon blocks while executing the traphandle
commands. (This should be fixed in the future with an
appropriate signal catch and wait() combination).</p>

<p>o All directives listed with a value of &quot;yes&quot;
actually accept a range of boolean values. These will accept
any of 1, yes or true to enable the corresponding behaviour,
or any of 0, no or false to disable it. The default in each
case is for the fea- ture to be turned off, so these
directives are typically only used to enable the appropriate
behaviour.</p>
