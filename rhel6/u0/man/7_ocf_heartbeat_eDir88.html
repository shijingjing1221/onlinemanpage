<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_eDir88 - Manages a Novell eDirectory
directory server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS eDir88 [start | stop | monitor | meta-data |
validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resource script for managing an eDirectory
instance. Manages a single instance of eDirectory as an HA
resource. The &quot;multiple instances&quot; feature or
eDirectory has been added in version 8.8. This script will
not work for any version of eDirectory prior to 8.8. This RA
can be used to load multiple eDirectory instances on the
same host. It is very strongly recommended to put eDir
configuration files (as per the eDir_config_file parameter)
on local storage on each node. This is necessary for this RA
to be able to handle situations where the shared storage has
become unavailable. If the eDir configuration file is not
available, this RA will fail, and heartbeat will be unable
to manage the resource. Side effects include STONITH
actions, unmanageable resources, etc... Setting a high
action timeout value is _very_ _strongly_ recommended. eDir
with IDM can take in excess of 10 minutes to start. If
heartbeat times out before eDir has had a chance to start
properly, mayhem _WILL ENSUE_. The LDAP module seems to be
one of the very last to start. So this script will take even
longer to start on installations with IDM and LDAP if the
monitoring of IDM and/or LDAP is enabled, as the start
command will wait for IDM and LDAP to be available.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS eDir_config_file Path to
configuration file for eDirectory instance. (optional,
string, default
/etc/opt/novell/eDirectory/conf/nds.conf)</p>

<p>eDir_monitor_ldap Should we monitor if LDAP is running
for the eDirectory instance? (optional, boolean, default
0)</p>

<p>eDir_monitor_idm Should we monitor if IDM is running for
the eDirectory instance? (optional, boolean, default 0)</p>

<p>eDir_jvm_initial_heap Value for the DHOST_INITIAL_HEAP
java environment variable. If unset, java defaults will be
used. (optional, integer, no default)</p>

<p>eDir_jvm_max_heap Value for the DHOST_MAX_HEAP java
environment variable. If unset, java defaults will be used.
(optional, integer, no default)</p>

<p>eDir_jvm_options Value for the DHOST_OPTIONS java
environment variable. If unset, original values will be
used. (optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
600.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
600.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 60. Suggested interval: 30.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
eDir88 resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>
