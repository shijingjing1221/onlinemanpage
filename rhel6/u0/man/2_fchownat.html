<p>FCHOWNAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FCHOWNAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME fchownat - change ownership of a file relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchownat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, uid_t
owner, gid_t group, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchownat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as chown(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
chown(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
chown(2)).</p>

<p>If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>flags can either be 0, or include the following
flag:</p>

<p>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW If pathname is a symbolic link, do
not dereference it: instead operate on the link itself, like
lchown(2). (By default, fchow- nat() dereferences symbolic
links, like chown(2).)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, fchownat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for chown(2) can also
occur for fchownat(). The following additional errors can
occur for fchownat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is relative and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS fchownat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008. A similar system call exists
on Solaris.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
fchownat().</p>
