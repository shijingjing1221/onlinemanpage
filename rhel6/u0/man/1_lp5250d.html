<p>NAME lp5250d - start an AS/400 printer session</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lp5250d [OPTIONS] HOSTNAME</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lp5250d connects to an AS/400 over TCP/IP
and provides a printer ses- sion emulating an IBM 3812
printer. The printer session works with scs2ascii and host
print transform on the AS/400 to print AS/400 spooled files
on a local printer.</p>

<p>To end a printer session, send it a SIGTERM signal with
kill(1).</p>

<p>Printing support requires named session support, which
is available for most recent versions of OS/400, but is only
supplied with V4R3 and later versions. For V3R2, V3R7, V4R1
and V4R2, please see informa- tional APAR II10918.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Additional lp5250d options are described in the
tn5250rc(5) man page.</p>

<p>-u, --user=USER run lp5250d as USER</p>

<p>-H, --help display this help and exit</p>

<p>-v, --version output version information and exit</p>

<p>EXAMPLES lp5250d env.DEVNAME=LINPRT1
env.IBMMFRTYPMDL=*HP4_as400sys Connect to as400sys as the
printer LINPRT1, using host print transform on the AS/400 to
print to an HP Laserjet or compatible using lpr.</p>

<p>lp5250d env.DEVNAME=LINPRT1 env.IBMMFRTYPMDL=*OKI184IBM_
outputcom- mand=scs2ascii | lpr -Poki_as400sys Print to an
Okidata Microline 184 Turbo on the local print queue named
