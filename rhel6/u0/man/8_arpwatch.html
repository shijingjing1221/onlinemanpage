<p>NAME arpwatch - keep track of ethernet/ip address
pairings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arpwatch [ -dN ] [ -f datafile ] [ -i interface
] [ -n net[/width ]] [ -r file ] [ -u username ] [ -e
username ] [ -s username ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Arpwatch keeps track for ethernet/ip address
pairings. It syslogs activity and reports certain changes
via email. Arpwatch uses pcap(3) to listen for arp packets
on a local ethernet interface.</p>

<p>The -d flag is used enable debugging. This also inhibits
forking into the background and emailing the reports.
Instead, they are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>The -f flag is used to set the ethernet/ip address
database filename. The default is arp.dat.</p>

<p>The -i flag is used to override the default
interface.</p>

<p>The -n flag specifies additional local networks. This
can be useful to avoid &quot;bogon&quot; warnings when there
is more than one network running on the same wire. If the
optional width is not specified, the default net- mask for
the networks class is used.</p>

<p>The -N flag disables reporting any bogons.</p>

<p>The -r flag is used to specify a savefile (perhaps
created by tcp- dump(1) or pcapture(1)) to read from instead
of reading from the net- work. In this case, arpwatch does
not fork.</p>

<p>If -u flag is used, arpwatch drops root privileges and
changes user ID to username and group ID to that of the
primary group of username. This is recommended for security
reasons.</p>

<p>If the -e flag is used, arpwatch sends e-mail messages
to username rather than the default (root). If a single -
character is given for the username, sending of e-mail is
suppressed, but logging via syslog is still done as usual.
(This can be useful during initial runs, to collect data
without being flooded with messages about new stations.)</p>

<p>If the -s flag is used, arpwatch sends e-mail messages
with username as the return address, rather than the default
(root).</p>

<p>Note that an empty arp.dat file must be created before
the first time you run arpwatch. Also, the default directory
(where arp.dat is stored) must be owned by username if -u
flag is used.</p>

<p>REPORT MESSAGES Heres a quick list of the report
messages generated by arpwatch(1) (and arpsnmp(1)):</p>

<p>new activity This ethernet/ip address pair has been used
for the first time six months or more.</p>

<p>new station The ethernet address has not been seen
before.</p>

<p>flip flop The ethernet address has changed from the most
recently seen address to the second most recently seen
address. (If either the old or new ethernet address is a
DECnet address and it is less than 24 hours, the email
version of the report is sup- pressed.)</p>

<p>changed ethernet address The host switched to a new
ethernet address.</p>

<p>SYSLOG MESSAGES Here are some of the syslog messages;
note that messages that are reported are also sysloged.</p>

<p>ethernet broadcast The mac ethernet address of the host
is a broadcast address.</p>

<p>ip broadcast The ip address of the host is a broadcast
address.</p>

<p>bogon The source ip address is not local to the local
subnet.</p>

<p>ethernet broadcast The source mac or arp ethernet
address was all ones or all zeros.</p>

<p>ethernet mismatch The source mac ethernet address didn t
match the address inside the arp packet.</p>

<p>reused old ethernet address The ethernet address has
changed from the most recently seen address to the third (or
greater) least recently seen address. (This is similar to a
flip flop.)</p>

<p>suppressed DECnet flip flop A &quot;flip flop&quot;
report was suppressed because one of the two addresses was a
DECnet address.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/arpwatch - default directory arp.dat -
ethernet/ip address database ethercodes.dat - vendor
ethernet block list</p>

<p>BUGS Please send bug reports to arpwatch@ee.lbl.gov.</p>

<p>Attempts are made to suppress DECnet flip flops but they
arent always successful.</p>

<p>Most error messages are posted using syslog.</p>
