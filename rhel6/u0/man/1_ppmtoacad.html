<p>NAME ppmtoacad - convert PPM to Autocad database or
slide</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoacad</p>

<p>[-dxb]</p>

<p>[-poly]</p>

<p>[-background color]</p>

<p>[-white]</p>

<p>[-aspect ratio]</p>

<p>[-8]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoacad reads a PPM image as input and produces an
Autocad&reg; slide file or binary database import (.dxb)
file as output. If you dont specify ppmfile, ppmtoacad takes
the input from Standard Input.</p>

<p>(Typographical note: the name of Autocad is often
rendered as AutoCAD. Netpbm documentation uses standard
American typography, wherein that is not a valid form of
capitalization).</p>

<p>OPTIONS You may abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-dxb ppmtoacad writes an Autocad binary database import
(.dxb) file. You read this file with the DXBIN command and,
once loaded, it becomes part of the Autocad geometrical
database, so you can view and edit it like any other object.
Each sequence of iden- tical pixels becomes a separate
object in the database; this can result in very large
Autocad drawing files. However, if you want to trace over a
bitmap, it lets you zoom and pan around the bitmap as you
wish.</p>

<p>-poly If you dont specify the -dxb option, ppmtoacad
generates an Autocad slide file. Normally each row of pixels
is represented by an Autocad line entity. If you specify
-poly, ppmtoacad ren- ders the pixels as filled polygons. If
you view the slide on a display with higher resolution than
the source image, this will cause the pixels to expand
instead of appearing as discrete lines against the screen
background color. Regrettably, this representation yields
slide files which occupy more storage space and take longer
to display.</p>

<p>-background color Most Autocad display drivers can be
configured to use any avail- able color as the screen
background. Some users prefer a black screen background,
others white, while splinter groups advocate burnt ocher,
tawny puce, and shocking gray. Discarding pixels whose
closest Autocad color representation is equal to the back-
ground color can substantially reduce the size of the
Autocad database or slide file needed to represent a bitmap.
If you dont specify -background, ppmtoacad assumes the
screen back- ground color to be black. You may specify any
Autocad color number as the screen background; ppmtoacad
assumes color numbers to specify the hues defined in the
standard Autocad 256 color palette.</p>

<p>-white Since many Autocad users choose a white screen
background, this option is provided as a short-cut.
Specifying -white is identi- cal in effect to -background
7.</p>

<p>-aspect ratio If the source image had non-square pixels
(which means it is not standard PPM), specify the ratio of
the pixel width to pixel height as ratio. ppmtoacad will
correct the resulting slide or .dxb file so that pixels on
the Autocad screen will be square. For example, to correct
an image made for a 320x200 VGA/MCGA screen, specify -aspect
0.8333.</p>

<p>-8 Restricts the colors in the output file to the 8 RGB
shades.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS Autocad has a fixed palette of 256 colors,
distributed along the hue, lightness, and saturation axes.
So it may poorly render images which contain many
nearly-identical colors, or colors not closely approxi-
mated by Autocads palette.</p>

<p>ppmtoacad works best if the system displaying its output
can display the full 256 color Autocad palette. Monochrome,
8 color, and 16 color configurations will produce less than
optimal results.</p>

<p>When creating a .dxb file or a slide file with the -poly
option, ppm- toacad finds both vertical and horizontal runs
of identical pixels and consolidates them into rectangular
regions to reduce the size of the output file. This is
effective for images with large areas of constant color but
it s no substitute for true raster to vector conversion. In
particular, this process does not optimize thin diagonal
lines at all.</p>

<p>Output files can be huge.</p>
