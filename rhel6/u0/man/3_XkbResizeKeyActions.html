<p>XkbResizeKeyActions(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbResizeKeyActions(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbResizeKeyActions - Change the number of actions
bound to a key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbAction * XkbResizeKeyActions (XkbDescRec
*xkb, int key, int needed);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description to change</p>

<p>- key keycode of key to change</p>

<p>- needed new number of actions required</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xkb parameter points to the keyboard
description containing the key whose number of actions is to
be changed. The key parameter is the key- code of the key to
change, and needed specifies the new number of actions
required for the key.</p>

<p>XkbResizeKeyActions reserves the space needed for the
actions and returns a pointer to the beginning of the new
array that holds the actions. It can change the acts,
num_acts, and size_acts fields of xkb-&gt;server if it is
necessary to reallocate the acts array.</p>

<p>If needed is greater than the current number of keysyms
for the key, XkbResizeKeyActions initializes all new actions
in the array to NoAc- tion.</p>

<p>Because the number of actions needed by a key is
normally computed as width * number of groups, and
XkbResizeKeyActions does not modify either the width or
number of groups for the key, a discrepancy exists on return
from XkbResizeKeyActions between the space allocated for the
actions and the number required. The unused entries in the
list of actions returned by XkbResizeKeyActions are not
preserved across future calls to any of the map editing
functions, so you must update the key actions (which updates
the width and number of groups for the key) before calling
another allocator function. A call to XkbChangeType- sOfKey
updates these.</p>

<p>If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number
of actions bound to the key, XkbResizeKeyActions returns
NULL.</p>

<p>NOTES A change to the number of actions bound to a key
should be accompanied by a change in the number of symbols
bound to a key. Refer to XkbRe- sizeKeySyms for more
information on changing the number of symbols bound to a
key.</p>
