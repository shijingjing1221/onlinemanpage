<p>PICKUP(8) PICKUP(8)</p>

<p>NAME pickup - Postfix local mail pickup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pickup [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pickup(8) daemon waits for hints that
new mail has been dropped into the maildrop directory, and
feeds it into the cleanup(8) daemon. Ill-formatted files are
deleted without notifying the originator. This program
expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.</p>

<p>STANDARDS None. The pickup(8) daemon does not interact
with the outside world.</p>

<p>SECURITY The pickup(8) daemon is moderately security
sensitive. It runs with fixed low privilege and can run in a
chrooted environment. However, the program reads files from
potentially hostile users. The pickup(8) daemon opens no
files for writing, is careful about what files it opens for
reading, and does not actually touch any data that is sent
to its public service endpoint.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The pickup(8) daemon copies mail from file to the
cleanup(8) daemon. It could avoid message copying overhead
by sending a file descriptor instead of file data, but then
the already complex cleanup(8) daemon would have to deal
with unfiltered user data.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS As the pickup(8) daemon is a
relatively long-running process, up to an hour may pass
before a main.cf change takes effect. Use the command
&quot;postfix reload&quot; command to speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>CONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS content_filter (empty) The
name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail after it
is queued.</p>

<p>receive_override_options (empty) Enable or disable
recipient validation, built-in content filter- ing, or
address mapping.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS config_directory (seepostconf
-doutput) The default location of the Postfix main.cf and
master.cf con- figuration files.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>line_length_limit (2048) Upon input, long lines are
chopped up into pieces of at most this length; upon
delivery, long lines are reconstructed.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>
