<p>NAME assert.h - verify program assertion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;assert.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;assert.h&gt; header shall define the
assert() macro. It refers to the macro NDEBUG which is not
defined in the header. If NDEBUG is defined as a macro name
before the inclusion of this header, the assert() macro
shall be defined simply as:</p>

<p>#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)</p>

<p>Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in
assert().</p>

<p>The assert() macro shall be redefined according to the
current state of NDEBUG each time &lt;assert.h&gt; is
included.</p>

<p>The assert() macro shall be implemented as a macro, not
as a function. If the macro definition is suppressed in
order to access an actual function, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
