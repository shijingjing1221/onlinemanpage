<p>Tcl_Concat(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_Concat(3)</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_Concat - concatenate a collection of
strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>const char * Tcl_Concat(argc, argv)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int argc (in) Number of strings.</p>

<p>const char *const argv[] (in) Array of strings to
concatenate. Must have argc entries.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_Concat is a utility procedure used by
several of the Tcl commands. Given a collection of strings,
it concatenates them together into a single string, with the
original strings separated by spaces. This procedure behaves
differently than Tcl_Merge, in that the arguments are simply
concatenated: no effort is made to ensure proper list
structure. However, in most common usage the arguments will
all be proper lists themselves; if this is true, then the
result will also have proper list structure.</p>

<p>Tcl_Concat eliminates leading and trailing white space
as it copies strings from argv to the result. If an element
of argv consists of nothing but white space, then that
string is ignored entirely. This white-space removal was
added to make the output of the concat command
cleaner-looking.</p>

<p>The result string is dynamically allocated using
Tcl_Alloc; the caller must eventually release the space by
calling Tcl_Free.</p>
