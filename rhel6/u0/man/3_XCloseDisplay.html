<p>XOpenDisplay(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XOpenDisplay(3)</p>

<p>NAME XOpenDisplay, XCloseDisplay - connect or disconnect
to X server</p>

<p>SYNTAX Display *XOpenDisplay(char *display_name);</p>

<p>int XCloseDisplay(Display *display);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>display_name Specifies the hardware display name, which
determines the display and communications domain to be used.
On a POSIX- conformant system, if the display_name is NULL,
it defaults to the value of the DISPLAY environment
variable.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XOpenDisplay function returns a Display
structure that serves as the connection to the X server and
that contains all the information about that X server.
XOpenDisplay connects your application to the X server
through TCP or DECnet communications protocols, or through
some local inter-process communication protocol. If the
hostname is a host machine name and a single colon (:)
separates the hostname and display number, XOpenDisplay
connects using TCP streams. If the hostname is not
specified, Xlib uses whatever it believes is the fastest
transport. If the hostname is a host machine name and a
double colon (::) sepa- rates the hostname and display
number, XOpenDisplay connects using DEC- net. A single X
server can support any or all of these transport mech-
anisms simultaneously. A particular Xlib implementation can
support many more of these transport mechanisms.</p>

<p>If successful, XOpenDisplay returns a pointer to a
Display structure, which is defined in &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;.
If XOpenDisplay does not succeed, it returns NULL. After a
successful call to XOpenDisplay, all of the screens in the
display can be used by the client. The screen number
specified in the display_name argument is returned by the
DefaultScreen macro (or the XDefaultScreen function). You
can access elements of the Display and Screen structures
only by using the information macros or functions. For
information about using macros and functions to obtain
information from the Display structure, see section
2.2.1.</p>

<p>The XCloseDisplay function closes the connection to the
X server for the display specified in the Display structure
and destroys all win- dows, resource IDs (Window, Font,
Pixmap, Colormap, Cursor, and GCon- text), or other
resources that the client has created on this display,
unless the close-down mode of the resource has been changed
(see XSet- CloseDownMode). Therefore, these windows,
resource IDs, and other resources should never be referenced
again or an error will be gener- ated. Before exiting, you
should call XCloseDisplay explicitly so that any pending
errors are reported as XCloseDisplay performs a final XSync
operation.</p>

<p>XCloseDisplay can generate a BadGC error.</p>
