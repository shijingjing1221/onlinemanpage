<p>TSEARCH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual TSEARCH(3)</p>

<p>NAME tsearch, tfind, tdelete, twalk, tdestroy - manage a
binary tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *tsearch(const void *key, void **rootp, int
(*compar)(const void *, const void *));</p>

<p>void *tfind(const void *key, const void **rootp, int
(*compar)(const void *, const void *));</p>

<p>void *tdelete(const void *key, void **rootp, int
(*compar)(const void *, const void *));</p>

<p>void twalk(const void *root, void (*action)(const void
*nodep, const VISIT which, const int depth));</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void tdestroy(void *root, void (*free_node)(void
*nodep));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tsearch(), tfind(), twalk(), and tdelete()
manage a binary tree. They are generalized from Knuth
(6.2.2) Algorithm T. The first field in each node of the
tree is a pointer to the corresponding data item. (The
calling program must store the actual data.) compar points
to a comparison routine, which takes pointers to two items.
It should return an integer which is negative, zero, or
positive, depending on whether the first item is less than,
equal to, or greater than the sec- ond.</p>

<p>tsearch() searches the tree for an item. key points to
the item to be searched for. rootp points to a variable
which points to the root of the tree. If the tree is empty,
then the variable that rootp points to should be set to
NULL. If the item is found in the tree, then tsearch()
returns a pointer to it. If it is not found, then tsearch()
adds it, and returns a pointer to the newly added item.</p>

<p>tfind() is like tsearch(), except that if the item is
not found, then tfind() returns NULL.</p>

<p>tdelete() deletes an item from the tree. Its arguments
are the same as for tsearch().</p>

<p>twalk() performs depth-first, left-to-right traversal of
a binary tree. root points to the starting node for the
traversal. If that node is not the root, then only part of
the tree will be visited. twalk() calls the user function
action each time a node is visited (that is, three times for
an internal node, and once for a leaf). action, in turn,
takes three arguments. The first is a pointer to the node
being visited. The second is an integer which takes on the
values preorder, postorder, and endorder depending on
whether this is the first, second, or third visit to the
internal node, or leaf if it is the single visit to a leaf
node. (These symbols are defined in &lt;search.h&gt;.) The
third argument is the depth of the node, with zero being the
root.</p>

<p>(More commonly, preorder, postorder, and endorder are
known as pre- order, inorder, and postorder: before visiting
the children, after the first and before the second, and
after visiting the children. Thus, the choice of name
postorder is rather confusing.)</p>

<p>tdestroy() removes the whole tree pointed to by root,
freeing all resources allocated by the tsearch() function.
For the data in each tree node the function free_node is
called. The pointer to the data is passed as the argument to
the function. If no such work is necessary free_node must
point to a function doing nothing.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE tsearch() returns a pointer to a matching
item in the tree, or to the newly added item, or NULL if
there was insufficient memory to add the item. tfind()
returns a pointer to the item, or NULL if no match is found.
If there are multiple elements that match the key, the
element returned is unspecified.</p>

<p>tdelete() returns a pointer to the parent of the item
deleted, or NULL if the item was not found.</p>

<p>tsearch(), tfind(), and tdelete() also return NULL if
rootp was NULL on entry.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. The function
tdestroy() is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES twalk() takes a pointer to the root, while the
other functions take a pointer to a variable which points to
the root.</p>

<p>twalk() uses postorder to mean &quot;after the left
subtree, but before the right subtree&quot;. Some
authorities would call this &quot;inorder&quot;, and reserve
&quot;postorder&quot; to mean &quot;after both
subtrees&quot;.</p>

<p>tdelete() frees the memory required for the node in the
tree. The user is responsible for freeing the memory for the
corresponding data.</p>

<p>The example program depends on the fact that twalk()
makes no further reference to a node after calling the user
function with argument &quot;endorder&quot; or
&quot;leaf&quot;. This works with the GNU library
implementation, but is not in the System V
documentation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program inserts twelve random
numbers into a binary tree, where duplicate numbers are
collapsed, then prints the numbers in order.</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE /* Expose declaration of tdestroy()
*/ #include &lt;search.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *root = NULL;</p>

<p>void * xmalloc(unsigned n) { void *p; p = malloc(n); if
(p) return p; fprintf(stderr, &quot;insufficient memory0);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>int compare(const void *pa, const void *pb) { if (*(int
*) pa &lt; *(int *) pb) return -1; if (*(int *) pa &gt;
*(int *) pb) return 1; return 0; }</p>

<p>void action(const void *nodep, const VISIT which, const
int depth) { int *datap;</p>

<p>switch (which) { case preorder: break; case postorder:
datap = *(int **) nodep; printf(&quot;%6d0, *datap); break;
case endorder: break; case leaf: datap = *(int **) nodep;
printf(&quot;%6d0, *datap); break; } }</p>

<p>int main(void) { int i, *ptr; void *val;</p>

<p>srand(time(NULL)); for (i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) { ptr =
(int *) xmalloc(sizeof(int)); *ptr = rand() &amp; 0xff; val
= tsearch((void *) ptr, &amp;root, compare); if (val ==
NULL) exit(EXIT_FAILURE); else if ((*(int **) val) != ptr)
free(ptr); } twalk(root, action); tdestroy(root, free);
exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
