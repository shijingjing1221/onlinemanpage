<p>NAME sfcbd - Small-Footprint CIM Broker (sfcb)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sfcbd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sfcb is a lightweight CIM daemon (aka CIMOM)
that responds to CIM client requests for system management
data and/or performs system man- agement tasks. sfcb
supports most of the standard CIM XML over http/https
protocol. It is highly modular, allowing functionality to be
easily added, removed or customized for different management
appli- cations. sfcb is specifically targetted for small
embedded system that do not have the available CPU, memory
or disk resources to support a full-blown enterprise-level
CIMOM. That said, sfcb runs very well on a regular
Linux/Unix system and supports most of the functions
required by CIM clients to manage such the system. Supported
CIM operations include:</p>

<p>GetClass EnumerateClasses EnumerateClassNames
GetInstance DeleteInstance CreateInstance ModifyInstance
EnumerateInstances EnumerateInstanceNames InvokeMethod
(MethodCall) ExecQuery Associators AssociatorNames
References ReferenceNames</p>

<p>CIM process and lifecycle indications (aka events ) are
also sup- ported.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Supported command line options are:</p>

<p>-c, --config-file=FILE Specify an alternative
configuration file. Default=/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg</p>

<p>-d, --daemon Run sfcbd (and child processes) in the
background.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-k, --color-trace -k, --color-trace Color the trace
output of each process</p>

<p>-s, --collect-stats Turn on runtime statistics
collecting. If enabled then various sfcbd runtime statistics
will be written to ./sfcbStat. Default is no statistics are
collected.</p>

<p>-t, --trace-components=NUM Activate component-level
tracing messages, where NUM is an OR-ed bitmask integer
defining which component to trace. Specifying &quot;-t
?&quot; will list all the components and their associated
integer bitmask.</p>

<p>-v, --version Prints version information and exits.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE sfcbd reads the configuration file
/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg (or the file specified with the -c
option) at start up. The configuration file con- tains
option : value pairs, one per line. For a complete list of
options, see the default configuration file included with
the sfcb package.</p>

<p>httpPort Local port that sfcbd should listen to receive
HTTP (i.e. inse- cure) requests from CIM clients.
Default=5988</p>

<p>enableHttp Whether sfcb should accept HTTP client
connections. Default=true.</p>

<p>httpProcs Maximum number of simultaneous HTTP client
connections before blocking new incoming HTTP requests.
Default=8</p>

<p>httpsPort Local port that sfcbd should listen to receive
HTTPS (i.e. secure) requests from CIM clients.
Default=5989</p>

<p>enableHttps Whether sfcb should accept HTTPS client
connections. Default=false.</p>

<p>httpsProcs Maximum number of simultaneous HTTPS client
connections before blocking new incoming HTTPS requests.
Default=8</p>

<p>enableInterOp Whether sfcb should provide the interop
namespace for indication support. Default=true</p>

<p>provProcs Maximum number of simultaneous provider
processes. After this point if a new incoming request
requires loading a new provider, then one of the existing
providers will first be automatically unloaded.
Default=32</p>

<p>doBasicAuth Perform basic authentication on the client
userid (obtained from the HTTP/HTTPS header) before allowing
the request. Default=false (i.e. no client authentication
performed).</p>

<p>basicAuthLib Name of the local library to call to
authenticate the client userid.
Default=sfcBasicAuthentication</p>

<p>useChunking Tell sfcbd to use HTTP/HTTPS chunking to
return large volumes of response data to the client in
chunks , rather than buffer- ing the data and sending it
back all at once. Default=true</p>

<p>keepaliveTimeout Specify the maximum time in seconds an
sfcb HTTP process will wait between two requests on one
connection before terminating. Setting it to 0 will disable
HTTP keep-alive. Default=0</p>

<p>keepaliveMaxRequest Specify the maximum number of
consecutive request on one connec- tion. Setting it to 0
will effectively disable HTTP keep-alive. Default=10</p>

<p>registrationDir Specify the registration directory,
which contains the provider registration data, the staging
area and the static repository.
Default=/var/lib/sfcb/registration</p>

<p>providerDirs A space separated list of directories where
sfcb is looking for provider libraries. Default=/usr/lib64
/usr/lib64/cmpi</p>

<p>providerSampleInterval The interval in seconds at which
the provider manager is check- ing for idle providers.
Default: 30</p>

<p>providerTimeoutInterval The interval in seconds before
an idle provider gets unloaded by the provider manager.
Default: 60</p>

<p>providerAutoGroup If set to true, all providers residing
in the same shared library will be executed in the same
process unless another group has been specified in the
provider registration file. Default: true</p>

<p>sslCertificateFilePath Specify the name of the file
containing the servers certifi- cate. The file must be in
PEM format. This file is only required if enableHttps is set
to true. Default= /etc/sfcb/server.pem</p>

<p>sslKeyFilePath Specify the name of the file containing
the private key for the servers certificate. The file must
be in PEM format and may not be passphrase-protected. This
file is only required if enable- Https is set to true.
Default=/etc/sfcb/file.pem</p>

<p>sslClientTrustStore Specify the name of the file or
directory containing either the CA certificate issuing
client certificates or self-signed cer- tificates of the
clients. This setting is only required if
sslClientCertificate is set to accept or require.</p>

<p>If a file, it must be in PEM format.</p>

<p>If a directory, it must be in &quot;hash format&quot;:
each file in the directory should be named hash.0, where
hash is the output of openssl x509 -hash. See the -CApath
option in verify(1) from the openssl package for more
information about the hash format.</p>

<p>Default=/etc/sfcb/client.pem</p>

<p>sslClientCertificate Specify the way sfcb handles client
certificate based authenti- cation. If set to ignore it will
not request a certificate from the client. If set to accept
it will request a certificate from the client but not fail
if the client doesn t present one. If set to require it will
refuse the client connection if the client doesnt present a
certificate. Default=ignore</p>

<p>certificateAuthLib Name of the local library to call for
client-certificate based user authentication. Called only if
sslClientCertificate is not set to ignore.
Default=sfcCertificateAuthentication</p>

<p>traceLevel Specify the trace level for sfcb. Can be
overriden by setting environment variable SFCB_TRACE_LEVEL.
Default:0.</p>

<p>traceMask Specify the trace mask for sfcb. Can be
overriden by the command line option --trace-components.
Default: 0.</p>

<p>traceFile Specify the trace file for sfcb. Can be
overriden by setting environment variable SFCB_TRACE_FILE.
Default: stderr.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SFCB_PAUSE_PROVIDER Specifies the name of
the provider to pause after first being loaded to facilitate
attaching a runtime debugger to the providers process for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>SFCB_PAUSE_CODEC Specifies the name of the sfcb codec
(currently only &quot;http&quot;) to pause after first being
started to facilitate attaching a run- time debugger to the
process.</p>

<p>SFCB_TRACE Specifies the level of trace/debug messages
for sfcb. Valid values are 0 (no trace messages), or 1 (key
trace messages only) to 4 (all messages). A default value of
1 will be assumed, if this variable is not set. [Note:
SFCB_TRACE level is used in conjunction with sfcbs com-
ponent-level tracing to control the level of detail of trace
messages to display within each component]</p>

<p>SFCB_TRACE_FILE By default sfcb trace messages are
written to STDERR. Setting this envorinment variable causes
the trace messages to be writ- ten to a file instead.</p>

<p>SFCB_TRAP If set this environment variable enables trap
interrupts on x86 platforms to be generated by sfcb in
special situations. [Note: not currently ever used]</p>

<p>SBLIM_TRACE Specifies the level of trace/debug messages
for SBLIM providers. Valid values are 0 (no trace messages),
or 1 (key trace messages only) to 4 (all messages). [Note:
this only applies to SBLIM providers written with explicit
trace messages in their source code.]</p>

<p>SBLIM_TRACE_FILE By default SBLIM provider trace
messages are written to STDERR. Setting this envorinment
variable causes the trace messages to be written to a file
instead.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg Default sfcb configuration
file.</p>

<p>/etc/sfcb/server.pem SSL server certificate for
sfcb.</p>

<p>/etc/sfcb/file.pem SSL private key file for sfcb.</p>

<p>/etc/sfcb/client.pem SSL client certificate / trust
store for sfcb.</p>

<p>LIBRARIES /usr/lib64/libsfc* Binaries for sfcb runtime
libraries.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/cmpi/* Binaries for providers</p>
