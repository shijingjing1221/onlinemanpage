<p>SIGALTSTACK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SIGALTSTACK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigaltstack - set and get signal alternate stack
context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigaltstack(const stack_t *restrict ss, stack_t
*restrict oss);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigaltstack() function allows a process
to define and examine the state of an alternate stack for
signal handlers for the current thread. Signals that have
been explicitly declared to execute on the alternate stack
shall be delivered on the alternate stack.</p>

<p>If ss is not a null pointer, it points to a stack_t
structure that specifies the alternate signal stack that
shall take effect upon return from sigaltstack(). The
ss_flags member specifies the new stack state. If it is set
to SS_DISABLE, the stack is disabled and ss_sp and ss_size
are ignored. Otherwise, the stack shall be enabled, and the
ss_sp and ss_size members specify the new address and size
of the stack.</p>

<p>The range of addresses starting at ss_sp up to but not
including ss_sp+ ss_size is available to the implementation
for use as the stack. This function makes no assumptions
regarding which end is the stack base and in which direction
the stack grows as items are pushed.</p>

<p>If oss is not a null pointer, on successful completion
it shall point to a stack_t structure that specifies the
alternate signal stack that was in effect prior to the call
to sigaltstack(). The ss_sp and ss_size members specify the
address and size of that stack. The ss_flags member
specifies the stack s state, and may contain one of the
following values:</p>

<p>SS_ONSTACK The process is currently executing on the
alternate signal stack. Attempts to modify the alternate
signal stack while the process is executing on it fail. This
flag shall not be modified by processes.</p>

<p>SS_DISABLE The alternate signal stack is currently
disabled.</p>

<p>The value SIGSTKSZ is a system default specifying the
number of bytes that would be used to cover the usual case
when manually allocating an alternate stack area. The value
MINSIGSTKSZ is defined to be the mini- mum stack size for a
signal handler. In computing an alternate stack size, a
program should add that amount to its stack requirements to
allow for the system implementation overhead. The constants
SS_ONSTACK, SS_DISABLE, SIGSTKSZ, and MINSIGSTKSZ are
defined in &lt;signal.h&gt;.</p>

<p>After a successful call to one of the exec functions,
there are no alternate signal stacks in the new process
image.</p>

<p>In some implementations, a signal (whether or not
indicated to execute on the alternate stack) shall always
execute on the alternate stack if it is delivered while
another signal is being caught using the alter- nate
stack.</p>

<p>Use of this function by library threads that are not
bound to kernel- scheduled entities results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sigaltstack()
shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sigaltstack() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The ss argument is not a null pointer, and the
ss_flags member pointed to by ss contains flags other than
SS_DISABLE.</p>

<p>ENOMEM The size of the alternate stack area is less than
MINSIGSTKSZ.</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to modify an active stack.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Allocating Memory for an Alternate Stack The
following example illustrates a method for allocating memory
for an alternate stack.</p>

<p>#include &lt;signal.h&gt; ... if ((sigstk.ss_sp =
malloc(SIGSTKSZ)) == NULL) /* Error return. */
sigstk.ss_size = SIGSTKSZ; sigstk.ss_flags = 0; if
(sigaltstack(&amp;sigstk,(stack_t *)0) &lt; 0)
perror(&quot;sigaltstack&quot;);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On some implementations, stack space
is automatically extended as needed. On those
implementations, automatic extension is typically not
available for an alternate stack. If the stack overflows,
the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
