<p>NAME sha384sum - compute and check SHA384 message
digest</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sha384sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print or check SHA384 (384-bit) checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.</p>

<p>-b, --binary read in binary mode</p>

<p>-c, --check read SHA384 sums from the FILEs and check
them</p>

<p>-t, --text read in text mode (default)</p>

<p>Note: There is no difference between binary and text
mode option on GNU system.</p>

<p>The following three options are useful only when
verifying checksums: --quiet dont print OK for each
successfully verified file</p>

<p>--status dont output anything, status code shows
success</p>

<p>-w, --warn warn about improperly formatted checksum
lines</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2. When
checking, the input should be a former output of this
program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum,
a character indicating type (* for binary, for text), and
name for each FILE.</p>
