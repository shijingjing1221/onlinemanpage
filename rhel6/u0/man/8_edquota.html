<p>NAME edquota - edit user quotas</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS edquota [ -p protoname ] [ -u | -g ] [ -rm ] [
-F format-name ] [ -f filesystem ] username...</p>

<p>edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f filesystem ]
-t</p>

<p>edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f filesystem ]
-T username | groupname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION edquota is a quota editor. One or more users
or groups may be speci- fied on the command line. If a
number is given in the place of user/group name it is
treated as an UID/GID. For each user or group a temporary
file is created with an ASCII representation of the current
disk quotas for that user or group and an editor is then
invoked on the file. The quotas may then be modified, new
quotas added, etc. Setting a quota to zero indicates that no
quota should be imposed.</p>

<p>Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a
grace period that may be specified per filesystem. Once the
grace period has expired, the soft limit is enforced as a
hard limit.</p>

<p>The current usage information in the file is for
informational pur- poses; only the hard and soft limits can
be changed.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary
file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the
changes made.</p>

<p>The editor invoked is vi(1) unless either the EDITOR or
the VISUAL environment variable specifies otherwise.</p>

<p>Only the super-user may edit quotas.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r, --remote Edit also non-local quota use
rpc.rquotad on remote server to set quota. This option is
available only if quota tools were compiled with enabled
support for setting quotas over RPC. The -n option is
equivalent, and is maintained for backward compati-
bility.</p>

<p>-m, --no-mixed-pathnames Currently, pathnames of NFSv4
mountpoints are sent without lead- ing slash in the path.
rpc.rquotad uses this to recognize NFSv4 mounts and properly
prepend pseudoroot of NFS filesystem to the path. If you
specify this option, setquota will always send paths with a
trailing slash. This can be useful for legacy rea- sons but
be aware that quota over RPC will stop working if you are
using new rpc.rquotad.</p>

<p>-u, --user Edit the user quota. This is the default.</p>

<p>-g, --group Edit the group quota.</p>

<p>-p, --prototype=protoname Duplicate the quotas of the
prototypical user specified for each user specified. This is
the normal mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of
users.</p>

<p>-F, --format=format-name Edit quota for specified format
(ie. dont perform format autodetection). Possible format
names are: vfsold (version 1 quota), vfsv0 (version 2
quota), rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS
filesystem)</p>

<p>-f, --filesystem filesystem Perform specified operations
only for given filesystem (default is to perform operations
for all filesystems with quota).</p>

<p>-t, --edit-period Edit the soft time limits for each
filesystem. In old quota format if the time limits are zero,
the default time limits in &lt;linux/quota.h&gt; are used.
In new quota format time limits must be specified (there is
no default value set in kernel). Time units of seconds,
minutes, hours, and days are under- stood. Time limits are
printed in the greatest possible time unit such that the
value is greater than or equal to one.</p>

<p>-T, --edit-times Edit time for the user/group when
softlimit is enforced. Possi- ble values are unset or number
and unit. Units are the same as in -t option.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/mtab mounted
filesystems table</p>
