<p>CALLGRIND CONTROL(1) Release 3.5.0 CALLGRIND
CONTROL(1)</p>

<p>NAME callgrind_control - observe and control programs
being run by Callgrind</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS callgrind_control [options]
[pid|program-name...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION callgrind_control controls programs being
run by the Valgrind tool Callgrind. When a pid/program name
argument is not specified, all applications currently being
run by Callgrind on this system will be used for actions
given by the specified option(s). The default action is to
give some brief information about the applications being run
by Callgrind.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h --help Show a short description, usage, and
summary of options.</p>

<p>--version Show version of callgrind_control.</p>

<p>-l --long Show also the working directory, in addition
to the brief information given by default.</p>

<p>-s --stat Show statistics information about active
Callgrind runs.</p>

<p>-b --back Show stack/back traces of each thread in
active Callgrind runs. For each active function in the stack
trace, also the number of invocations since program start
(or last dump) is shown. This option can be combined with -e
to show inclusive cost of active functions.</p>

<p>-e [A,B,...] (default: all) Show the current per-thread,
exclusive cost values of event counters. If no explicit
event names are given, figures for all event types which are
collected in the given Callgrind run are shown. Otherwise,
only figures for event types A, B, ... are shown. If this
option is combined with -b, inclusive cost for the functions
of each active stack frame is provided, too.</p>

<p>--dump[=&lt;desc&gt;] (default: no description) Request
the dumping of profile information. Optionally, a
description can be specified which is written into the dump
as part of the information giving the reason which triggered
the dump action. This can be used to distinguish multiple
dumps.</p>

<p>-z --zero Zero all event counters.</p>

<p>-k --kill Force a Callgrind run to be terminated.</p>

<p>--instr=&lt;on|off&gt; Switch instrumentation mode on or
off. If a Callgrind run has instrumentation disabled, no
simulation is done and no events are counted. This is useful
to skip uninteresting program parts, as there is much less
slowdown (same as with the Valgrind tool &quot;none&quot;).
See also the Callgrind option --instr-atstart.</p>

<p>-w=&lt;dir&gt; Specify the startup directory of an
active Callgrind run. On some systems, active Callgrind runs
can not be detected. To be able to control these, the failed
auto-detection can be worked around by specifying the
directory where a Callgrind run was started.</p>
