<p>XkbSelectEventDetails(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbSelectEventDetails(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSelectEventDetails - Selects or deselects for a
specific Xkb event and optionally places conditions on when
events of that type are reported to your client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbSelectEventDetails (Display *display,
unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int event_type, unsigned
long int bits_to_change, unsigned long int
values_for_bits);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display connection to the X server</p>

<p>device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>event_type Xkb event type of interest</p>

<p>bits_to_change determines events to be selected /
deselected</p>

<p>values_for_bits 1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events
in bits_to_change</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb events are selected using an event mask,
much the same as normal core X events are selected. However,
unlike selecting core X events, where you must specify the
selection status (on or off) for all possi- ble event types
whenever you wish to change the selection criteria for any
one event, Xkb allows you to restrict the specification to
only the event types you wish to change. This means that you
do not need to remember the event selection values for all
possible types each time you want to change one of them.</p>

<p>Many Xkb event types are generated under several
different circum- stances. When selecting to receive an Xkb
event, you may specify either that you want it delivered
under all circumstances, or that you want it delivered only
for a subset of the possible circumstances.</p>

<p>You can also deselect an event type that was previously
selected for, using the same granularity.</p>

<p>Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect
delivery of Xkb events. XkbSelectEvents allows you to select
or deselect delivery of more than one Xkb event type at
once. Events selected using XkbSe- lectEvents are delivered
to your program under all circumstances that generate the
events. To restrict delivery of an event to a subset of the
conditions under which it occurs, use XkbSelectEventDetails.
XkbSe- lectEventDetails only allows you to change the
selection conditions for a single event at a time, but it
provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which
the event is delivered.</p>

<p>To select or deselect for a specific Xkb event and
optionally place conditions on when events of that type are
reported to your client, use XkbSelectEventDetails. This
allows you to exercise a finer granularity of control over
delivery of Xkb events with XkbSelectEvents.</p>

<p>While XkbSelectEvents allows multiple events to be
selected, XkbSe- lectEventDetails changes the selection
criteria for a single type of Xkb event. The interpretation
of the bits_to_change and values_for_bits masks depends on
the event type in question.</p>

<p>XkbSelectEventDetails changes the Xkb event selection
mask for the key- board specified by device_spec and the Xkb
event specified by event_type. To turn on event selection
for an event detail, set the bit for the detail in the
bits_to_change parameter and set the corre- sponding bit in
the values_for_bits parameter. To turn off event detail
selection for a detail, set the bit for the detail in the
bits_to_change parameter and do not set the corresponding
bit in the values_for_bits parameter.</p>

<p>If an invalid event type is specified, a BadValue
protocol error results. If a bit is not set in the
bits_to_change parameter, but the corresponding bit is set
in the values_for_bits parameter, a BadMatch protocol error
results. If an undefined bit is set in either the
bits_to_change or the values_for_bits parameter, a BadValue
protocol error results.</p>

<p>For each type of Xkb event, the legal event details that
you can spec- ify in the XkbSelectEventDetails request are
listed in the chapters that describe each event in
detail.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not
available in the server or an argument has correct type and
range, but is otherwise invalid</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
