<p>NAME xfs_metadump - copy XFS filesystem metadata to a
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_metadump [ -efgow ] [ -l logdev ] source
target</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_metadump is a debugging tool that copies
the metadata from an XFS filesystem to a file. The source
argument must be the pathname of the device or file
containing the XFS filesystem and the target argument
specifies the destination file name. If target is -, then
the output is sent to stdout. This allows the output to be
redirected to another program such as a compression
application.</p>

<p>xfs_metadump should only be used to copy unmounted
filesystems, read- only mounted filesystems, or frozen
filesystems (see xfs_freeze(8)). Otherwise, the generated
dump could be inconsistent or corrupt.</p>

<p>xfs_metadump does not alter the source filesystem in any
way. The tar- get image is a contiguous (non-sparse) file
containing all the filesys- tems metadata and indexes to
where the blocks were copied from.</p>

<p>By default, xfs_metadump obfuscates most file (regular
file, directory and symbolic link) names and extended
attribute names to allow the dumps to be sent without
revealing confidential information. Extended attribute
values are zeroed and no data is copied. The only exceptions
are file or attribute names that are 4 or less characters in
length. Also file names that span extents (this can only
occur with the mkfs.xfs(8) options where -n size &gt; -b
size) are not obfuscated. Names between 5 and 8 characters
in length inclusively are partially obfus- cated.</p>

<p>xfs_metadump should not be used for any purposes other
than for debug- ging and reporting filesystem problems. The
most common usage scenario for this tool is when
xfs_repair(8) fails to repair a filesystem and a metadump
image can be sent for analysis.</p>

<p>The file generated by xfs_metadump can be restored to
filesystem image (minus the data) using the xfs_mdrestore(8)
tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e Stops the dump on a read error. Normally, it
will ignore read errors and copy all the metadata that is
accessible.</p>

<p>-f Specifies that the filesystem image to be processed
is stored in a regular file (see the mkfs.xfs -d file
option). This can also happen if an image copy of a
filesystem has been made into an ordinary file with
xfs_copy(8).</p>

<p>-g Shows dump progress. This is sent to stdout if the
target is a file or to stderr if the target is stdout.</p>

<p>-l logdev For filesystems which use an external log,
this specifies the device where the external log resides.
The external log is not copied, only internal logs are
copied.</p>

<p>-o Disables obfuscation of file names and extended
attributes.</p>

<p>-w Prints warnings of inconsistant metadata encountered
to stderr. Bad metadata is still copied.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS xfs_metadump returns an exit code of 0 if
all readable metadata is suc- cesfully copied or 1 if a
write error occurs or a read error occurs and the -e option
used.</p>

<p>NOTES As xfs_metadump copies metadata only, it does not
matter if the source filesystem has a realtime section or
not. If the filesystem has an external log, it is not
copied. Internal logs are copied and any out- standing log
transactions are not obfuscated if they contain names.</p>

<p>xfs_metadump is a shell wrapper around the xfs_db(8)
metadump command.</p>
