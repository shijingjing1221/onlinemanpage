<p>XGetWindowAttributes(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XGetWindowAttributes(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGetWindowAttributes, XGetGeometry,
XWindowAttributes - get current window attribute or geometry
and current window attributes structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XGetWindowAttributes(Display *display,
Window w, XWindowAt- tributes
*window_attributes_return);</p>

<p>Status XGetGeometry(Display *display, Drawable d, Window
*root_return, int *x_return, int *y_return, unsigned int
*width_return, unsigned int *height_return, unsigned int
*border_width_return, unsigned int *depth_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS border_width_return Returns the border width
in pixels.</p>

<p>d Specifies the drawable, which can be a window or a
pixmap.</p>

<p>depth_return Returns the depth of the drawable (bits per
pixel for the object).</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>root_return Returns the root window.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window whose current attributes you want
to obtain.</p>

<p>width_return height_return Return the drawable s
dimensions (width and height).</p>

<p>window_attributes_return Returns the specified windows
attributes in the XWindowAt- tributes structure.</p>

<p>x_return y_return Return the x and y coordinates that
define the location of the drawable. For a window, these
coordinates specify the upper-left outer corner relative to
its parents origin. For pixmaps, these coordinates are
always zero.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGetWindowAttributes function returns
the current attributes for the specified window to an
XWindowAttributes structure. It returns a nonzero status on
success; otherwise, it returns a zero status.</p>

<p>XGetWindowAttributes can generate BadDrawable and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XGetGeometry function returns the root window and
the current geom- etry of the drawable. The geometry of the
drawable includes the x and y coordinates, width and height,
border width, and depth. These are described in the argument
list. It is legal to pass to this function a window whose
class is InputOnly. It returns a nonzero status on suc-
cess; otherwise, it returns a zero status.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XWindowAttributes structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int x, y; /* location of window */ int
width, height; /* width and height of window */ int
border_width; /* border width of window */ int depth; /*
depth of window */ Visual *visual; /* the associated visual
structure */ Window root; /* root of screen containing
window */ int class; /* InputOutput, InputOnly*/ int
bit_gravity; /* one of the bit gravity values */ int
win_gravity; /* one of the window gravity values */ int
backing_store; /* NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always */ unsigned
long backing_planes;/* planes to be preserved if possible */
unsigned long backing_pixel;/* value to be used when
restoring planes */ Bool save_under; /* boolean, should bits
under be saved? */ Colormap colormap; /* color map to be
associated with window */ Bool map_installed; /* boolean, is
color map currently installed*/ int map_state; /*
IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable, IsViewable */ long
all_event_masks; /* set of events all people have interest
in*/ long your_event_mask; /* my event mask */ long
do_not_propagate_mask;/* set of events that should not
propagate */ Bool override_redirect; /* boolean value for
override-redirect */ Screen *screen; /* back pointer to
correct screen */ } XWindowAttributes;</p>

<p>The x and y members are set to the upper-left outer
corner relative to the parent windows origin. The width and
height members are set to the inside size of the window, not
including the border. The bor- der_width member is set to
the windows border width in pixels. The depth member is set
to the depth of the window (that is, bits per pixel for the
object). The visual member is a pointer to the screens asso-
ciated Visual structure. The root member is set to the root
window of the screen containing the window. The class member
is set to the win- dows class and can be either InputOutput
or InputOnly.</p>

<p>The bit_gravity member is set to the windows bit gravity
and can be one of the following:</p>

<p>ForgetGravity EastGravity NorthWestGrav- SouthWestGrav-
ity ity NorthGravity SouthGravity NorthEastGrav-
SouthEastGrav- ity ity WestGravity StaticGravity
CenterGravity</p>

<p>The win_gravity member is set to the windows window
gravity and can be one of the following:</p>

<p>UnmapGravity EastGravity NorthWestGrav- SouthWestGrav-
ity ity NorthGravity SouthGravity NorthEastGrav-
SouthEastGrav- ity ity WestGravity StaticGravity
CenterGravity</p>

<p>For additional information on gravity, see section
3.3.</p>

<p>The backing_store member is set to indicate how the X
server should maintain the contents of a window and can be
WhenMapped, Always, or NotUseful. The backing_planes member
is set to indicate (with bits set to 1) which bit planes of
the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved in
backing_stores and during save_unders. The backing_pixel
member is set to indicate what values to use for planes not
set in backing_planes.</p>

<p>The save_under member is set to True or False. The
colormap member is set to the colormap for the specified
window and can be a colormap ID or None. The map_installed
member is set to indicate whether the col- ormap is
currently installed and can be True or False. The map_state
member is set to indicate the state of the window and can be
IsUn- mapped, IsUnviewable, or IsViewable. IsUnviewable is
used if the win- dow is mapped but some ancestor is
unmapped.</p>

<p>The all_event_masks member is set to the bitwise
inclusive OR of all event masks selected on the window by
all clients. The your_event_mask member is set to the
bitwise inclusive OR of all event masks selected by the
querying client. The do_not_propagate_mask member is set to
the bitwise inclusive OR of the set of events that should
not propagate.</p>

<p>The override_redirect member is set to indicate whether
this window overrides structure control facilities and can
be True or False. Win- dow manager clients should ignore the
window if this member is True.</p>

<p>The screen member is set to a screen pointer that gives
you a back pointer to the correct screen. This makes it
easier to obtain the screen information without having to
loop over the root window fields to see which field
matches.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
