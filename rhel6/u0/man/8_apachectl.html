<p>NAME apachectl - Apache HTTP Server Control
Interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS When acting in pass-through mode, apachectl can
take all the arguments available for the httpd binary.</p>

<p>apachectl [ httpd-argument ]</p>

<p>When acting in SysV init mode, apachectl takes simple,
one-word com- mands, defined below.</p>

<p>apachectl command</p>

<p>SUMMARY apachectl is a front end to the Apache HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to help the
administrator control the functioning of the Apache httpd
daemon.</p>

<p>The apachectl script can operate in two modes. First, it
can act as a simple front-end to the httpd command that
simply sets any necessary environment variables and then
invokes httpd, passing through any com- mand line arguments.
Second, apachectl can act as a SysV init script, taking
simple one-word arguments like start, restart, and stop, and
translating them into appropriate signals to httpd.</p>

<p>If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths, you
will need to edit the apachectl script to set the
appropriate paths to the httpd binary. You can also specify
any necessary httpd command line argu- ments. See the
comments in the script for details.</p>

<p>The apachectl script returns a 0 exit value on success,
and &gt;0 if an error occurs. For more details, view the
comments in the script.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Only the SysV init-style options are defined
here. Other arguments are defined on the httpd manual
page.</p>

<p>start Start the Apache httpd daemon. Gives an error if
it is already running. This is equivalent to apachectl -k
start.</p>

<p>stop Stops the Apache httpd daemon. This is equivalent
to apachectl -k stop.</p>

<p>restart Restarts the Apache httpd daemon. If the daemon
is not running, it is started. This command automatically
checks the configura- tion files as in configtest before
initiating the restart to make sure the daemon doesnt die.
This is equivalent to apachectl -k restart.</p>

<p>fullstatus Displays a full status report from
mod_status. For this to work, you need to have mod_status
enabled on your server and a text- based browser such as
lynx available on your system. The URL used to access the
status report can be set by editing the STA- TUSURL variable
in the script.</p>

<p>status Displays a brief status report. Similar to the
fullstatus option, except that the list of requests
currently being served is omitted.</p>

<p>graceful Gracefully restarts the Apache httpd daemon. If
the daemon is not running, it is started. This differs from
a normal restart in that currently open connections are not
aborted. A side effect is that old log files will not be
closed immediately. This means that if used in a log
rotation script, a substantial delay may be necessary to
ensure that the old log files are closed before processing
them. This command automatically checks the configuration
files as in configtest before initiating the restart to make
sure Apache doesnt die. This is equivalent to apachectl -k
graceful.</p>

<p>graceful-stop Gracefully stops the Apache httpd daemon.
This differs from a normal stop in that currently open
connections are not aborted. A side effect is that old log
files will not be closed immedi- ately. This is equivalent
to apachectl -k graceful-stop.</p>

<p>configtest Run a configuration file syntax test. It
parses the configura- tion files and either reports Syntax
Ok or detailed information about the particular syntax
error. This is equivalent to apachectl -t.</p>

<p>The following option was available in earlier versions
but has been removed.</p>

<p>startssl To start httpd with SSL support, you should
edit your configura- tion file to include the relevant
directives and then use the normal apachectl start.</p>
