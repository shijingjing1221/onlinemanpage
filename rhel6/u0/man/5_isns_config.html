<p>ISNS_CONFIG(8) ISNS_CONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME isns_config - iSNS configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/isns/isnsadm.conf /etc/isns/isnsd.conf
/etc/isns/isnsdd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All Open-iSNS utilities read their
configuration from a file in /etc/isns. There is a separate
configuration file for each applica- tion, isnsd, isnsadm,
and isnsdd. The syntax and the set of supported options is
identical, even though some options are specific to e.g. the
server. Unless indicated, options are applicable to all
utilities.</p>

<p>An Open-iSNS configuration file contains
keyword-argument pairs, one per line. All keywords are case
insensitive.</p>

<p>A # character introduces a comment, which extends until
the end of the line. Empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p>There are no line continuations, and you cannot use
quotes around argu- ments.</p>

<p>Some options specify timeout values, which are given in
units of sec- onds by default. You can specify an explicit
unit, however, such as d (days), h (hours), m (minutes), or
s (seconds).</p>

<p>Generic Options HostName By default, Open-iSNS
applications will retrieve the machines hostname using the
gethostname(3) system call, and use a DNS lookup to look up
the canonical name. Using the HostName option, you can
overried this. This option is rarely needed.</p>

<p>SourceName This option is mandatory for all Open-iSNS
applications. This should be a name which identifies the
client uniquely. There are two readings of RFC 4171; one
requires that this is an iSCSI qualified name such as
iqn.2001-04.com.example.host, whereas other language in the
RFC suggests that this is pretty much a free-format string
that just has to be unique (using e.g. the clients fully
qualified domain name).</p>

<p>When using DSA authentication, Open-iSNS currently
requires the source name to match the key identifier (SPI)
of the clients public key.</p>

<p>If left empty, the source name is derived from the
clients hostname.</p>

<p>ServerAddress (client): This options specifies the host
name or address of the iSNS server to talk to. It can
optionally be followed by a colon, and a port number.</p>

<p>Instead of a hostname, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can be
used. In order to avoid ambiguities, literal IPv6 addresses
must be sur- rounded by square brackets, as in
[2001:4e5f::1].</p>

<p>When specifying a port number, you can use either the
numeric port, or a string name to be looked up in
/etc/services. When the port is omitted, it defaults to
3205, the IANA assigned port number of iSNS.</p>

<p>If the special string SLP: is used, the client will try
to locate the iSNS server through SLP.</p>

<p>SLPRegister (server): If set to 1, the iSNS daemon will
register itself will the SLP service. This allows clients to
contact the server without hav- ing to configure its address
statically.</p>

<p>PIDFile (server): This specifies the name of the servers
PID file, which is /var/run/isnsd.pid by default.</p>

<p>Database Related Options These options apply to the iSNS
server only, and control operation of the iSNS database.</p>

<p>Database This option is used to specify how the database
is stored. Set- ting this to an absolute path name will make
isnsd keep its database in the specified directory.</p>

<p>If you leave this empty, isnsd will keep its database in
memory. This is also the default setting.</p>

<p>DefaultDiscoveryDomain iSNS scopes visibility of other
nodes using so-called Discovery Domains. A storage node A
will only &quot;see&quot; storage node B, if both are
members of the same discovery domain.</p>

<p>So if a storage node is registered which is not part of
any dis- covery domain, it will not see any other nodes.</p>

<p>By setting DefaultDiscoveryDomain=1, you can tell isnsd
to cre- ate a virtual &quot;default discovery domain&quot;,
which holds all nodes that are not part of any
administratively configured discovery domain.</p>

<p>By default, there is no default discovery domain.</p>

<p>RegistrationPeriod The iSNS server can purge registered
entities after a certain period of inactivity. This is
called the registration period. Clients who register objects
are supposed to refresh their reg- istration within this
period.</p>

<p>The default value is 1 hour. Setting it to 0 disables
expiry of entities from the database.</p>

<p>ESIRetries Open-iSNS is able to monitor the reachability
of storage nodes and their portals by using a protocol
feature called ESI (Entity status inquiry). Clients request
ESI monitoring by registering an ESI port along with each
portal. The server will send ESI messages to these portals
at regular intervals. If the portal fails to reply several
times in a row, it is considered dead, and will be removed
from the database.</p>

<p>ESIRetries specifies the maximum number of attempts the
server will make at contacting the portal before pronouncing
it dead. If set to 0, the server will disable ESI and reject
any regis- trations that specify an ESI port with an error
code of &quot;ESI not supported&quot;.</p>

<p>The default value is 3.</p>

<p>ESIMinInterval This timeout value specifies the minimum
ESI interval. If a client requests an ESI interval less than
this value, it is silently rounded up.</p>

<p>The default value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>ESIMaxInterval This timeout value specifies the maximum
ESI interval. If a client requests an ESI interval greater
than this value, it is silently rounded down.</p>

<p>The default value is 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The maximum ESI interval must not exceed half the value
of the registration period.</p>

<p>SCNRetries iSNS clients can register to receive State
Change Notification (SCN) messages to learn about changes in
the iSNS database. This value specifies how often the server
will try to retransmit an SCN message until giving up.</p>

<p>The default value is 3.</p>

<p>SCNCallout This is the path name of a helper program
that isnsdd will invoke whenever it processes a state change
notification from the server. The helper program will be
invoked with an argument indicating the type of event, being
one of add, update, or remove. This is followed by a list of
attributes in name=value notation, using the names and
conventions described in isnsadm(8).</p>

<p>Security Related Options The iSNS standard defines an
authentication method based on the DSA algorithm.
Participants in a message exchange authenticate messages by
adding an &quot;authentication block&quot; containing a time
stamp, a string identifying the key used, and a digital
signature of the message. The same method is also used by
SLP, the Service Location Protocol.</p>

<p>The string contained in the authentication block is
referred to as the Security Policy Index(SPI). This string
can be used by the server to look up the clients public key
by whatever mechanism; so the string could be used as the
name of a public key file in a directory, or to retrieve an
X509 certificate from LDAP.</p>

<p>From the perspective of Open-iSNS client applications,
there are only two keys: the clients own (private) key, used
to sign the messages it sends to the server, and the servers
public key, used to verify the signatures of incoming server
messages.</p>

<p>The iSNS server needs, in addition to its own private
key, access to all public keys of clients that will
communicate to it. The latter are kept in what is called a
key store. Key stores and their operation will be discussed
in section Key Stores and Policy below.</p>

<p>The following configuration options control
authentication:</p>

<p>Security This enables or disables DSA authentication.
When set to 1, the client will sign all messages, and expect
all server messages to be signed.</p>

<p>When enabling security in the server, incoming messages
are checked for the presence of an auth block. If none is
present, or if the server cannot find a public key
corresponding to the SPI, the message is treated as
originating from an anonymous source. If the SPI is known
but the signature is incorrect, the message is dropped
silently.</p>

<p>Messages from an anonymous source will be assigned a
very restrictive policy that allows database queries
only.</p>

<p>Setting this option to 0 will turn off
authentication.</p>

<p>The default value is -1, which tells iSNS to use
authentication if the required keys are installed, and use
unauthenticated iSNS otherwise.</p>

<p>AuthName This is the string that will be used as the SPI
in all outgoing messages that have an auth block. It
defaults to the host name (please refer to option
HostName).</p>

<p>AuthKeyFile This is the path name of a file containing a
PEM encoded DSA key. This key is used to sign outgoing
messages. The default is /etc/isns/auth_key.</p>

<p>ServerKeyFile This option is used by client applications
only, and specifies the path name of a file containing a PEM
encoded DSA key. This key is used to authenticate the
servers replies. The default is
/etc/isns/server_key.pub.</p>

<p>KeyStore This server-side option specifies the key store
to use, described in the next section.</p>

<p>The following two options control how iSNS will verify
the time stamp contained in the authentication block, which
is supposed to prevent replay attacks.</p>

<p>Auth.ReplayWindow In order to compensate for clock drift
between two hosts exchanging iSNS messages, Open-iSNS will
apply a little fuzz when comparing the time stamp contained
in the message to the local system time. If the difference
between time stamp and local system time is less than the
number of seconds given by this option, the message is
acceptable. Otherwise, it is rejected.</p>

<p>The default value is 5m.</p>

<p>Auth.TimestampJitter When verifying incoming messages,
Open-iSNS checks that the time stamps sent by the peer are
increasing monotonically. In order to compensate for the
reordering of messages by the network (eg when using UDP as
transport), a certain time stamp jitter is accepted. If the
time stamp of an incoming messages is no ear- lier than
TimestampJitter seconds before the last time stamp received,
then the message is acceptable. Otherwise, it is
rejected.</p>

<p>The default value is 1s.</p>

<p>Key Stores and Policy The current implementation
supports two types of key stores.</p>

<p>The simple key store uses a flat directory to store
public keys, each key in a file of its own. The file is
expected to hold the clients PEM-encoded public key, and it
must use the clients SPI as the name. This type of key store
is not really recommended, as it does not store any policy
information.</p>

<p>A simple key store can be configured by setting the
KeyStore option to the path name of the directory.</p>

<p>The recommended approach is to use the database as key
store. This uses vendor-specific policy objects to tie SPI
string, public key, entity name, source name and other bits
of policy together, and store them in a persistent way.</p>

<p>The database key store is configured by setting the
KeyStore option to the reserved value DB:, which is also the
default.</p>

<p>Currently, Open-iSNS policy objects have the following
attributes, besides the SPI:</p>

<p>Source: This is the source node name the client must
use. It defaults to the SPI string.</p>

<p>Functions: This is a bitmap detailing which functions
the client is permit- ted to invoke. The bit names
correspond to the shorthand names used in RFC 4711, such as
DevAttrReg, DevAttrQry, etc. The default is to allow
registration, query and deregistration, as well as
SCNRegister.</p>

<p>Entity name: This is the entity name assigned to the
client. If set, a regis- tration by the client is not
permitted to use a different entity name. If the client
sends a registration without Entity identi- fier, the server
will assign the entity name given in the pol- icy. The
default is to not restrict the entity name.</p>

<p>Object access: This is a bitfield describing access
permissions for each object type. For each object type, you
can grant Read and/or Write permissions. Read access applies
to the Query and GetNext calls; all other operations require
write permission. The default grants read and write access
to objects of type Entity, Storage Node, Portal and Portal
Group; and read access to Dis- covery Domains.</p>

<p>Node types: This bitfield describes which types of
storage nodes a client is allowed to register; the valid bit
names are target, initiator and control. The default is to
restrict nodes to register ini- tiators only.</p>

<p>Network Related Options Network.MaxSockets This is the
number of incoming connections accepted, and defaults to
1024. This usually applies to server side only, but is
relevant if you create a passive TCP socket for ESI or
SCN.</p>

<p>Network.ConnectTimeout This is a timeout value, which
specifies the time to wait for a TCP connection to be
established. It defaults to 60s.</p>

<p>Network.ReconnectTimeout When a connection attempt
failed, we wait for a short time before we try connecting
again. This is intended to take the pressure off overloaded
servers. The default value is 10s.</p>

<p>Network.CallTimeout Total amount of time to wait before
timing out a call to the iSNS server. The default value is
60s.</p>
