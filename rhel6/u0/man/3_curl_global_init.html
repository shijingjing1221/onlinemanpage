<p>NAME curl_global_init - Global libcurl
initialisation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLcode curl_global_init(long flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function sets up the program
environment that libcurl needs. Think of it as an extension
of the library loader.</p>

<p>This function must be called at least once within a
program (a program is all the code that shares a memory
space) before the program calls any other function in
libcurl. The environment it sets up is constant for the life
of the program and is the same for every program, so mul-
tiple calls have the same effect as one call.</p>

<p>The flags option is a bit pattern that tells libcurl
exactly what fea- tures to init, as described below. Set the
desired bits by ORing the values together. In normal
operation, you must specify CURL_GLOBAL_ALL. Dont use any
other value unless you are familiar with it and mean to
control internal operations of libcurl.</p>

<p>This function is not thread safe. You must not call it
when any other thread in the program (i.e. a thread sharing
the same memory) is run- ning. This doesnt just mean no
other thread that is using libcurl. Because
curl_global_init() calls functions of other libraries that
are similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with any
other thread that uses these other libraries.</p>

<p>See the description in libcurl(3) of global environment
requirements for details of how to use this function.</p>

<p>FLAGS CURL_GLOBAL_ALL Initialize everything possible.
This sets all known bits.</p>

<p>CURL_GLOBAL_SSL Initialize SSL</p>

<p>CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 Initialize the Win32 socket
libraries.</p>

<p>CURL_GLOBAL_NOTHING Initialise nothing extra. This sets
no bit.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If this function returns non-zero,
something went wrong and you cannot use the other curl
functions.</p>
