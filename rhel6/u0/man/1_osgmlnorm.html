<p>NAME osgmlnorm - An SGML/XML document normalizer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS osgmlnorm [-CdeghmnrRvx] [-alinktype]
[-Aarchitecture] [-bbctf] [-ccatalog] [-Ddirectory...]
[-Emax_errors...] [-iname...] [-fname...] [-wwarning...]
[sysid...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION osgmlnorm prints on the standard output a
normalized document instance for the SGML document contained
in the concatenation of the entities with system
identifiers</p>

<p>When the normalized instance is prefixed with the
original SGML declaration and prolog, it will have the same
ESIS as the original SGML document, with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p>* The output of osgmlnorm does not protect against the
recognition of short reference delimiters, so any USEMAP
declarations must be removed from the DTD.</p>

<p>* The normalized instance will use the reference
delimiters, even if the original instance did not.</p>

<p>* If marked sections are included in the output using
the -m option, the reference reserved names will be used for
the status keywords even if the original instance did
not.</p>

<p>* Any ESIS information relating to the SGML LINK feature
will be lost.</p>

<p>The normalized instance will not use any markup
minimization features except that:</p>

<p>* Any attributes that were not specified in the original
instance will not be included in the normalized instance.
(Current attributes will be included.)</p>

<p>* If the declared value of an attribute was a name token
group, and a value was specified that was the same as the
name of the attribute, then the attribute name and value
indicator will be omitted. For example, with HTML osgmlnorm
would output &lt;DL COMPACT&gt; rather than &lt;DL
COMPACT=&quot;COMPACT&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>Part of an SGML System Conforming to International
Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language.
An SGML Extended Facilities system conforming to Annex A of
International Standard ISO/IEC 10744 --
Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-aname, --activate=name Make doctype or linktype name
active.</p>

<p>-Aarchitecture, --architecture=architecture Parse with
respect to architecture architecture.</p>

<p>-bbctf, --bctf=bctf Use the BCTF with name bctf for
output.</p>

<p>-csysid, --catalog=sysid Map public identifiers and
entity names to system identifiers using the catalog entry
file whose system identifier is sysid.</p>

<p>-C, --catalogs This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-d, --dtd Output a document type declaration with the
same external identifier as the input document, and with no
internal declaration subset. No check is performed that the
document instance is valid with respect to this DTD.</p>

<p>-Ddirectory, --directory=directory Search directory for
files specified in system identifiers.</p>

<p>This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-e, --open-entities Describe open entities in error
messages.</p>

<p>--error-numbers Show error numbers in error
messages.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-iname, --include=name This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-m, --marked-sections Output any marked sections that
were in the input document instance.</p>

<p>-n, --comments Output any comments that were in the
input document instance.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Raw output. Don&acute;t perform any conversion
on RSs and REs when printing the entity. The entity would
typically have the storage manager attribute
records=asis.</p>

<p>-R, --restricted This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number.</p>

<p>-wtype Control warnings and errors according to type.
This has the same effect as in onsgmls(1).</p>
