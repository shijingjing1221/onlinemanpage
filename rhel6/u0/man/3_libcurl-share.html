<p>libcurl-share(3) libcurl share interface
libcurl-share(3)</p>

<p>NAME libcurl-share - how to use the share interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is an overview on how to use the
libcurl share interface in your C programs. There are
specific man pages for each function mentioned in here.</p>

<p>All functions in the share interface are prefixed with
curl_share.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES The share interface was added to enable
sharing of data between curl &quot;handles&quot;.</p>

<p>ONE SET OF DATA - MANY TRANSFERS You can have multiple
easy handles share data between them. Have them update and
use the same cookie database or DNS cache! This way, each
single transfer will take advantage from data updates made
by the other transfer(s).</p>

<p>SHARE OBJECT You create a shared object with
curl_share_init(3). It returns a handle for a newly created
one.</p>

<p>You tell the shared object what data you want it to
share by using curl_share_setopt(3). Currently you can only
share DNS and/or COOKIE data.</p>

<p>Since you can use this share from multiple threads, and
libcurl has no internal thread synchronization, you must
provide mutex callbacks if youre using this multi-threaded.
You set lock and unlock functions with curl_share_setopt(3)
too.</p>

<p>Then, you make an easy handle to use this share, you set
the CUR- LOPT_SHARE option with curl_easy_setopt(3), and
pass in share handle. You can make any number of easy
handles share the same share handle.</p>

<p>To make an easy handle stop using that particular share,
you set CUR- LOPT_SHARE to NULL for that easy handle. To
make a handle stop sharing a particular data, you can
CURLSHOPT_UNSHARE it.</p>

<p>When youre done using the share, make sure that no easy
handle is still using it, and call curl_share_cleanup(3) on
the handle.</p>
