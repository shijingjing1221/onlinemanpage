<p>XmbLookupString(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XmbLookupString(3)</p>

<p>NAME XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString, Xutf8LookupString
- obtain composed input from an input method</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XmbLookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent
*event, char *buffer_return, int bytes_buffer, KeySym
*keysym_return, Status *status_return);</p>

<p>int XwcLookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent *event,
wchar_t *buffer_return, int wchars_buffer, KeySym
*keysym_return, Status *status_return);</p>

<p>int Xutf8LookupString(XIC ic, XKeyPressedEvent *event,
char *buffer_return, int bytes_buffer, KeySym
*keysym_return, Status *status_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS buffer_return Returns a multibyte string or
wide character string (if any) from the input method.</p>

<p>bytes_buffer wchars_buffer Specifies space available in
the return buffer.</p>

<p>event Specifies the key event to be used.</p>

<p>ic Specifies the input context.</p>

<p>keysym_return Returns the KeySym computed from the event
if this argument is not NULL.</p>

<p>status_return Returns a value indicating what kind of
data is returned.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString and
Xutf8LookupString functions return the string from the input
method specified in the buffer_return argument. If no string
is returned, the buffer_return argument is unchanged.</p>

<p>The KeySym into which the KeyCode from the event was
mapped is returned in the keysym_return argument if it is
non-NULL and the status_return argument indicates that a
KeySym was returned. If both a string and a KeySym are
returned, the KeySym value does not necessarily correspond
to the string returned.</p>

<p>XmbLookupString and Xutf8LookupString return the length
of the string in bytes, and XwcLookupString returns the
length of the string in char- acters. Both XmbLookupString
and XwcLookupString return text in the encoding of the
locale bound to the input method of the specified input
context, and Xutf8LookupString returns text in UTF-8
encoding.</p>

<p>Each string returned by XmbLookupString and
XwcLookupString begins in the initial state of the encoding
of the locale (if the encoding of the locale is
state-dependent).</p>

<p>Note</p>

<p>&reg;To ensure proper input processing, it is essential
that the client pass only KeyPress events to
XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString and Xutf8LookupString.
Their behavior when a client passes a KeyRelease event is
undefined.</p>

<p>Clients should check the status_return argument before
using the other returned values. These three functions each
return a value to sta- tus_return that indicates what has
been returned in the other argu- ments. The possible values
returned are:</p>

<p>XBufferOverflow The input string to be returned is too
large for the supplied buffer_return. The required size (for
XmbLookupString, Xutf8LookupString in bytes; for XwcLookup-
String in characters) is returned as the value of the
function, and the contents of buffer_return and
keysym_return are not modified. The client should recall the
function with the same event and a buffer of adequate size
to obtain the string. XLookupNone No consistent input has
been composed so far. The contents of buffer_return and
keysym_return are not modified, and the function returns
zero. XLookupChars Some input characters have been composed.
They are placed in the buffer_return argu- ment, using the
encoding described above, and the string length is returned
as the value of the function. The content of the
keysym_return argument is not modified. XLookupKeySym A
KeySym has been returned instead of a string and is returned
in keysym_return. The content of the buffer_return argument
is not modified, and the function returns zero. XLookupBoth
Both a KeySym and a string are returned; XLookupChars and
XLookupKeySym occur simul- taneously.</p>

<p>It does not make any difference if the input context
passed as an argu- ment to XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString
and Xutf8LookupString is the one currently in possession of
the focus or not. Input may have been composed within an
input context before it lost the focus, and that input may
be returned on subsequent calls to XmbLookupString,
XwcLookupString or Xutf8LookupString even though it does not
have any more keyboard focus.</p>

<p>The function Xutf8LookupString is an extension
introduced by The XFree86 Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2
release. Its presence is indicated by the macro
X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.</p>
