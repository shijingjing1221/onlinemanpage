<p>NAME rpc - library routines for remote procedure
calls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION These routines allow C programs
to make procedure calls on other machines across the
network. First, the client calls a procedure to send a data
packet to the server. Upon receipt of the packet, the server
calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service,
and then sends back a reply. Finally, the procedure call
returns to the client.</p>

<p>To take use of these routines, include the header file
&lt;rpc/rpc.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The prototypes below make use of the following
types:</p>

<p>typedef int bool_t;</p>

<p>typedef bool_t (*xdrproc_t) (XDR *, void *,...);</p>

<p>typedef bool_t (*resultproc_t) (caddr_t resp, struct
sockaddr_in *raddr);</p>

<p>See the header files for the declarations of the AUTH,
CLIENT, SVCXPRT, and XDR types.</p>

<p>void auth_destroy(AUTH *auth);</p>

<p>A macro that destroys the authentication information
associated with auth. Destruction usually involves
deallocation of private data structures. The use of auth is
undefined after calling auth_destroy().</p>

<p>AUTH *authnone_create(void);</p>

<p>Create and return an RPC authentication handle that
passes non- usable authentication information with each
remote procedure call. This is the default authentication
used by RPC.</p>

<p>AUTH *authunix_create(char *host, int uid, int gid, int
len, int *aup_gids);</p>

<p>Create and return an RPC authentication handle that
contains authentication information. The parameter host is
the name of the machine on which the information was
created; uid is the user s user ID; gid is the users current
group ID; len and aup_gids refer to a counted array of
groups to which the user belongs. It is easy to impersonate
a user.</p>

<p>AUTH *authunix_create_default(void);</p>

<p>Calls authunix_create() with the appropriate
parameters.</p>

<p>int callrpc(char *host, unsigned long prognum, unsigned
long versnum, unsigned long procnum, xdrproc_t inproc, char
*in, xdrproc_t outproc, char *out);</p>

<p>Call the remote procedure associated with prognum,
versnum, and procnum on the machine, host. The parameter in
is the address of the procedures argument(s), and out is the
address of where to place the result(s); inproc is used to
encode the procedures parameters, and outproc is used to
decode the procedures results. This routine returns zero if
it succeeds, or the value of enum clnt_stat cast to an
integer if it fails. The routine clnt_perrno() is handy for
translating failure statuses into messages.</p>

<p>Warning: calling remote procedures with this routine
uses UDP/IP as a transport; see clntudp_create() for
restrictions. You do not have control of timeouts or
authentication using this rou- tine.</p>

<p>enum clnt_stat clnt_broadcast(unsigned long prognum,
unsigned long versnum, unsigned long procnum, xdrproc_t
inproc, char *in, xdrproc_t outproc, char *out, resultproc_t
eachresult);</p>

<p>Like callrpc(), except the call message is broadcast to
all locally connected broadcast nets. Each time it receives
a response, this routine calls eachresult(), whose form
is:</p>

<p>eachresult(char *out, struct sockaddr_in *addr);</p>

<p>where out is the same as out passed to clnt_broadcast(),
except that the remote procedures output is decoded there;
addr points to the address of the machine that sent the
results. If eachre- sult() returns zero, clnt_broadcast()
waits for more replies; otherwise it returns with
appropriate status.</p>

<p>Warning: broadcast sockets are limited in size to the
maximum transfer unit of the data link. For ethernet, this
value is 1500 bytes.</p>

<p>enum clnt_stat clnt_call(CLIENT *clnt, unsigned long
procnum, xdrproc_t inproc, char *in, xdrproc_t outproc, char
*out, struct timeval tout);</p>

<p>A macro that calls the remote procedure procnum
associated with the client handle, clnt, which is obtained
with an RPC client creation routine such as clnt_create().
The parameter in is the address of the procedures
argument(s), and out is the address of where to place the
result(s); inproc is used to encode the procedures
parameters, and outproc is used to decode the proce- dure s
results; tout is the time allowed for results to come
back.</p>

<p>clnt_destroy(CLIENT *clnt);</p>

<p>A macro that destroys the client s RPC handle.
Destruction usu- ally involves deallocation of private data
structures, including clnt itself. Use of clnt is undefined
after calling clnt_destroy(). If the RPC library opened the
associated socket, it will close it also. Otherwise, the
socket remains open.</p>

<p>CLIENT *clnt_create(char *host, unsigned long prog,
unsigned long vers, char *proto);</p>

<p>Generic client creation routine. host identifies the
name of the remote host where the server is located. proto
indicates which kind of transport protocol to use. The
currently sup- ported values for this field are udp and tcp
. Default time- outs are set, but can be modified using
clnt_control().</p>

<p>Warning: Using UDP has its shortcomings. Since UDP-based
RPC messages can only hold up to 8 Kbytes of encoded data,
this transport cannot be used for procedures that take large
argu- ments or return huge results.</p>

<p>bool_t clnt_control(CLIENT *cl, int req, char
*info);</p>

<p>A macro used to change or retrieve various information
about a client object. req indicates the type of operation,
and info is a pointer to the information. For both UDP and
TCP, the sup- ported values of req and their argument types
and what they do are:</p>

<p>CLSET_TIMEOUT struct timeval // set total timeout
CLGET_TIMEOUT struct timeval // get total timeout</p>

<p>Note: if you set the timeout using clnt_control(), the
timeout parameter passed to clnt_call() will be ignored in
all future calls.</p>

<p>CLGET_SERVER_ADDR struct sockaddr_in // get servers
address</p>

<p>The following operations are valid for UDP only:</p>

<p>CLSET_RETRY_TIMEOUT struct timeval // set the retry
timeout CLGET_RETRY_TIMEOUT struct timeval // get the retry
timeout</p>

<p>The retry timeout is the time that &quot;UDP RPC&quot;
waits for the server to reply before retransmitting the
request.</p>

<p>clnt_freeres(CLIENT * clnt, xdrproc_t outproc, char
*out);</p>

<p>A macro that frees any data allocated by the RPC/XDR
system when it decoded the results of an RPC call. The
parameter out is the address of the results, and outproc is
the XDR routine describ- ing the results. This routine
returns one if the results were successfully freed, and zero
otherwise.</p>

<p>void clnt_geterr(CLIENT *clnt, struct rpc_err
*errp);</p>

<p>A macro that copies the error structure out of the
client handle to the structure at address errp.</p>

<p>void clnt_pcreateerror(char *s);</p>

<p>Print a message to standard error indicating why a
client RPC handle could not be created. The message is
prepended with string s and a colon. Used when a
clnt_create(), clntraw_cre- ate(), clnttcp_create(), or
clntudp_create() call fails.</p>

<p>void clnt_perrno(enum clnt_stat stat);</p>

<p>Print a message to standard error corresponding to the
condition indicated by stat. Used after callrpc().</p>

<p>clnt_perror(CLIENT *clnt, char *s);</p>

<p>Print a message to standard error indicating why an RPC
call failed; clnt is the handle used to do the call. The
message is prepended with string s and a colon. Used after
clnt_call().</p>

<p>char *clnt_spcreateerror(char *s);</p>

<p>Like clnt_pcreateerror(), except that it returns a
string instead of printing to the standard error.</p>

<p>Bugs: returns pointer to static data that is overwritten
on each call.</p>

<p>char *clnt_sperrno(enum clnt_stat stat);</p>

<p>Take the same arguments as clnt_perrno(), but instead of
sending a message to the standard error indicating why an
RPC call failed, return a pointer to a string which contains
the message. The string ends with a NEWLINE.</p>

<p>clnt_sperrno() is used instead of clnt_perrno() if the
program does not have a standard error (as a program running
as a server quite likely does not), or if the programmer
does not want the message to be output with printf(3), or if
a message format dif- ferent than that supported by
clnt_perrno() is to be used. Note: unlike clnt_sperror() and
clnt_spcreaterror(), clnt_sper- rno() returns pointer to
static data, but the result will not get overwritten on each
call.</p>

<p>char *clnt_sperror(CLIENT *rpch, char *s);</p>

<p>Like clnt_perror(), except that (like clnt_sperrno()) it
returns a string instead of printing to standard error.</p>

<p>Bugs: returns pointer to static data that is overwritten
on each call.</p>

<p>CLIENT *clntraw_create(unsigned long prognum, unsigned
long versnum);</p>

<p>This routine creates a toy RPC client for the remote
program prognum, version versnum. The transport used to pass
messages to the service is actually a buffer within the
processs address space, so the corresponding RPC server
should live in the same address space; see svcraw_create().
This allows simulation of RPC and acquisition of RPC
overheads, such as round trip times, without any kernel
interference. This routine returns NULL if it fails.</p>

<p>CLIENT *clnttcp_create(struct sockaddr_in *addr,
unsigned long prognum, unsigned long versnum, int *sockp,
unsigned int sendsz, unsigned int recvsz);</p>

<p>This routine creates an RPC client for the remote
program prognum, version versnum; the client uses TCP/IP as
a transport. The remote program is located at Internet
address *addr. If addr-&gt;sin_port is zero, then it is set
to the actual port that the remote program is listening on
(the remote portmap service is consulted for this
information). The parameter sockp is a socket; if it is
RPC_ANYSOCK, then this routine opens a new one and sets
sockp. Since TCP-based RPC uses buffered I/O, the user may
specify the size of the send and receive buffers with the
parameters sendsz and recvsz; values of zero choose suitable
defaults. This routine returns NULL if it fails.</p>

<p>CLIENT *clntudp_create(struct sockaddr_in *addr,
unsigned long prognum, unsigned long versnum, struct timeval
wait, int *sockp);</p>

<p>This routine creates an RPC client for the remote
program prognum, version versnum; the client uses use UDP/IP
as a trans- port. The remote program is located at Internet
address addr. If addr-&gt;sin_port is zero, then it is set
to actual port that the remote program is listening on (the
remote portmap service is consulted for this information).
The parameter sockp is a socket; if it is RPC_ANYSOCK, then
this routine opens a new one and sets sockp. The UDP
transport resends the call message in intervals of wait time
until a response is received or until the call times out.
The total time for the call to time out is specified by
clnt_call().</p>

<p>Warning: since UDP-based RPC messages can only hold up
to 8 Kbytes of encoded data, this transport cannot be used
for proce- dures that take large arguments or return huge
results.</p>

<p>CLIENT *clntudp_bufcreate(struct sockaddr_in *addr,
unsigned long prognum, unsigned long versnum, struct timeval
wait, int *sockp, unsigned int sendsize, unsigned int
recosize);</p>

<p>This routine creates an RPC client for the remote
program prognum, on versnum; the client uses use UDP/IP as a
transport. The remote program is located at Internet address
addr. If addr-&gt;sin_port is zero, then it is set to actual
port that the remote program is listening on (the remote
portmap service is consulted for this information). The
parameter sockp is a socket; if it is RPC_ANYSOCK, then this
routine opens a new one and sets sockp. The UDP transport
resends the call message in intervals of wait time until a
response is received or until the call times out. The total
time for the call to time out is specified by
clnt_call().</p>

<p>This allows the user to specify the maximum packet size
for sending and receiving UDP-based RPC messages.</p>

<p>void get_myaddress(struct sockaddr_in *addr);</p>

<p>Stuff the machine s IP address into *addr, without
consulting the library routines that deal with /etc/hosts.
The port number is always set to htons(PMAPPORT).</p>

<p>struct pmaplist *pmap_getmaps(struct sockaddr_in
*addr);</p>

<p>A user interface to the portmap service, which returns a
list of the current RPC program-to-port mappings on the host
located at IP address *addr. This routine can return NULL.
The command rpcinfo -p uses this routine.</p>

<p>unsigned short pmap_getport(struct sockaddr_in *addr,
unsigned long prognum, unsigned long versnum, unsigned int
protocol);</p>

<p>A user interface to the portmap service, which returns
the port number on which waits a service that supports
program number prognum, version versnum, and speaks the
transport protocol associated with protocol. The value of
protocol is most likely IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP. A return
value of zero means that the mapping does not exist or that
the RPC system failed to con- tact the remote portmap
service. In the latter case, the global variable
rpc_createerr contains the RPC status.</p>

<p>enum clnt_stat pmap_rmtcall(struct sockaddr_in *addr,
unsigned long prognum, unsigned long versnum, unsigned long
procnum, xdrproc_t inproc, char *in, xdrproc_t outproc, char
*out, struct timeval tout, unsigned long *portp);</p>

<p>A user interface to the portmap service, which instructs
portmap on the host at IP address *addr to make an RPC call
on your behalf to a procedure on that host. The parameter
*portp will be modified to the program s port number if the
procedure suc- ceeds. The definitions of other parameters
are discussed in callrpc() and clnt_call(). This procedure
should be used for a ping and nothing else. See also
clnt_broadcast().</p>

<p>bool_t pmap_set(unsigned long prognum, unsigned long
versnum, unsigned int protocol, unsigned short port);</p>

<p>A user interface to the portmap service, which
establishes a mapping between the triple
[prognum,versnum,protocol] and port on the machines portmap
service. The value of protocol is most likely IPPROTO_UDP or
IPPROTO_TCP. This routine returns one if it succeeds, zero
otherwise. Automatically done by svc_regis- ter().</p>

<p>bool_t pmap_unset(unsigned long prognum, unsigned long
versnum);</p>

<p>A user interface to the portmap service, which destroys
all map- ping between the triple [prognum,versnum,*] and
ports on the machines portmap service. This routine returns
one if it suc- ceeds, zero otherwise.</p>

<p>int registerrpc(unsigned long prognum, unsigned long
versnum, unsigned long procnum, char *(*procname)(char *),
xdrproc_t inproc, xdrproc_t outproc);</p>

<p>Register procedure procname with the RPC service
package. If a request arrives for program prognum, version
versnum, and proce- dure procnum, procname is called with a
pointer to its parame- ter(s); progname should return a
pointer to its static result(s); inproc is used to decode
the parameters while outproc is used to encode the results.
This routine returns zero if the registration succeeded, -1
otherwise.</p>

<p>Warning: remote procedures registered in this form are
accessed using the UDP/IP transport; see svcudp_create() for
restric- tions.</p>

<p>struct rpc_createerr rpc_createerr;</p>

<p>A global variable whose value is set by any RPC client
creation routine that does not succeed. Use the routine
clnt_pcreateer- ror() to print the reason why.</p>

<p>void svc_destroy(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>A macro that destroys the RPC service transport handle,
xprt. Destruction usually involves deallocation of private
data struc- tures, including xprt itself. Use of xprt is
undefined after calling this routine.</p>

<p>fd_set svc_fdset;</p>

<p>A global variable reflecting the RPC service sides read
file descriptor bit mask; it is suitable as a parameter to
the select(2) system call. This is only of interest if a
service implementor does not call svc_run(), but rather does
his own asynchronous event processing. This variable is
read-only (do not pass its address to select(2)!), yet it
may change after calls to svc_getreqset() or any creation
routines.</p>

<p>int svc_fds;</p>

<p>Similar to svc_fdset, but limited to 32 descriptors.
This interface is obsoleted by svc_fdset.</p>

<p>svc_freeargs(SVCXPRT *xprt, xdrproc_t inproc, char
*in);</p>

<p>A macro that frees any data allocated by the RPC/XDR
system when it decoded the arguments to a service procedure
using svc_getargs(). This routine returns 1 if the results
were suc- cessfully freed, and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>svc_getargs(SVCXPRT *xprt, xdrproc_t inproc, char
*in);</p>

<p>A macro that decodes the arguments of an RPC request
associated with the RPC service transport handle, xprt. The
parameter in is the address where the arguments will be
placed; inproc is the XDR routine used to decode the
arguments. This routine returns one if decoding succeeds,
and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr_in *svc_getcaller(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>The approved way of getting the network address of the
caller of a procedure associated with the RPC service
transport handle, xprt.</p>

<p>void svc_getreqset(fd_set *rdfds);</p>

<p>This routine is only of interest if a service
implementor does not call svc_run(), but instead implements
custom asynchronous event processing. It is called when the
select(2) system call has determined that an RPC request has
arrived on some RPC socket(s); rdfds is the resultant read
file descriptor bit mask. The routine returns when all
sockets associated with the value of rdfds have been
serviced.</p>

<p>void svc_getreq(int rdfds);</p>

<p>Similar to svc_getreqset(), but limited to 32
descriptors. This interface is obsoleted by
svc_getreqset().</p>

<p>bool_t svc_register(SVCXPRT *xprt, unsigned long
prognum, unsigned long versnum, void (*dispatch)(svc_req *,
SVCXPRT *), unsigned long protocol);</p>

<p>Associates prognum and versnum with the service dispatch
proce- dure, dispatch. If protocol is zero, the service is
not regis- tered with the portmap service. If protocol is
non-zero, then a mapping of the triple
[prognum,versnum,protocol] to xprt-&gt;xp_port is
established with the local portmap service (generally
protocol is zero, IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP). The procedure
dispatch has the following form:</p>

<p>dispatch(struct svc_req *request, SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>The svc_register() routine returns one if it succeeds,
and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>void svc_run(void);</p>

<p>This routine never returns. It waits for RPC requests to
arrive, and calls the appropriate service procedure using
svc_getreq() when one arrives. This procedure is usually
wait- ing for a select(2) system call to return.</p>

<p>bool_t svc_sendreply(SVCXPRT *xprt, xdrproc_t outproc,
char *out);</p>

<p>Called by an RPC services dispatch routine to send the
results of a remote procedure call. The parameter xprt is
the requests associated transport handle; outproc is the XDR
routine which is used to encode the results; and out is the
address of the results. This routine returns one if it
succeeds, zero other- wise.</p>

<p>void svc_unregister(unsigned long prognum, unsigned long
versnum);</p>

<p>Remove all mapping of the double [prognum,versnum] to
dispatch routines, and of the triple [prognum,versnum,*] to
port number.</p>

<p>void svcerr_auth(SVCXPRT *xprt, enum auth_stat why);</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to
perform a remote procedure call due to an authentication
error.</p>

<p>void svcerr_decode(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that cannot
successfully decode its parameters. See also
svc_getargs().</p>

<p>void svcerr_noproc(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that does not
implement the procedure number that the caller requests.</p>

<p>void svcerr_noprog(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called when the desired program is not registered with
the RPC package. Service implementors usually do not need
this routine.</p>

<p>void svcerr_progvers(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called when the desired version of a program is not
registered with the RPC package. Service implementors
usually do not need this routine.</p>

<p>void svcerr_systemerr(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine when it detects a
system error not covered by any particular protocol. For
example, if a service can no longer allocate storage, it may
call this rou- tine.</p>

<p>void svcerr_weakauth(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to
perform a remote procedure call due to insufficient
authentication parame- ters. The routine calls
svcerr_auth(xprt, AUTH_TOOWEAK).</p>

<p>SVCXPRT *svcfd_create(int fd, unsigned int sendsize,
unsigned int recvsize);</p>

<p>Create a service on top of any open descriptor.
Typically, this descriptor is a connected socket for a
stream protocol such as TCP. sendsize and recvsize indicate
sizes for the send and receive buffers. If they are zero, a
reasonable default is cho- sen.</p>

<p>SVCXPRT *svcraw_create(void);</p>

<p>This routine creates a toy RPC service transport, to
which it returns a pointer. The transport is really a buffer
within the process s address space, so the corresponding RPC
client should live in the same address space; see
clntraw_create(). This rou- tine allows simulation of RPC
and acquisition of RPC overheads (such as round trip times),
without any kernel interference. This routine returns NULL
if it fails.</p>

<p>SVCXPRT *svctcp_create(int sock, unsigned int
send_buf_size, unsigned int recv_buf_size);</p>

<p>This routine creates a TCP/IP-based RPC service
transport, to which it returns a pointer. The transport is
associated with the socket sock, which may be RPC_ANYSOCK,
in which case a new socket is created. If the socket is not
bound to a local TCP port, then this routine binds it to an
arbitrary port. Upon completion, xprt-&gt;xp_sock is the
transports socket descriptor, and xprt-&gt;xp_port is the
transport s port number. This routine returns NULL if it
fails. Since TCP-based RPC uses buffered I/O, users may
specify the size of buffers; values of zero choose suitable
defaults.</p>

<p>SVCXPRT *svcudp_bufcreate(int sock, unsigned int
sendsize, unsigned int recosize);</p>

<p>This routine creates a UDP/IP-based RPC service
transport, to which it returns a pointer. The transport is
associated with the socket sock, which may be RPC_ANYSOCK,
in which case a new socket is created. If the socket is not
bound to a local UDP port, then this routine binds it to an
arbitrary port. Upon completion, xprt-&gt;xp_sock is the
transports socket descriptor, and xprt-&gt;xp_port is the
transports port number. This routine returns NULL if it
fails.</p>

<p>This allows the user to specify the maximum packet size
for sending and receiving UDP-based RPC messages.</p>

<p>SVCXPRT *svcudp_create(int sock);</p>

<p>This call is equivalent to svcudp_bufcreate(sock,SZ,SZ)
for some default size SZ.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_accepted_reply(XDR *xdrs, struct
accepted_reply *ar);</p>

<p>Used for encoding RPC reply messages. This routine is
useful for users who wish to generate RPC-style messages
without using the RPC package.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_authunix_parms(XDR *xdrs, struct
authunix_parms *aupp);</p>

<p>Used for describing Unix credentials. This routine is
useful for users who wish to generate these credentials
without using the RPC authentication package.</p>

<p>void xdr_callhdr(XDR *xdrs, struct rpc_msg *chdr);</p>

<p>Used for describing RPC call header messages. This
routine is useful for users who wish to generate RPC-style
messages without using the RPC package.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_callmsg(XDR *xdrs, struct rpc_msg *cmsg);</p>

<p>Used for describing RPC call messages. This routine is
useful for users who wish to generate RPC-style messages
without using the RPC package.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_opaque_auth(XDR *xdrs, struct opaque_auth
*ap);</p>

<p>Used for describing RPC authentication information
messages. This routine is useful for users who wish to
generate RPC-style messages without using the RPC
package.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_pmap(XDR *xdrs, struct pmap *regs);</p>

<p>Used for describing parameters to various portmap
procedures, externally. This routine is useful for users who
wish to gener- ate these parameters without using the pmap
interface.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_pmaplist(XDR *xdrs, struct pmaplist
**rp);</p>

<p>Used for describing a list of port mappings, externally.
This routine is useful for users who wish to generate these
parame- ters without using the pmap interface.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_rejected_reply(XDR *xdrs, struct
rejected_reply *rr);</p>

<p>Used for describing RPC reply messages. This routine is
useful for users who wish to generate RPC-style messages
without using the RPC package.</p>

<p>bool_t xdr_replymsg(XDR *xdrs, struct rpc_msg
*rmsg);</p>

<p>Used for describing RPC reply messages. This routine is
useful for users who wish to generate RPC style messages
without using the RPC package.</p>

<p>void xprt_register(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>After RPC service transport handles are created, they
should register themselves with the RPC service package.
This routine modifies the global variable svc_fds. Service
implementors usu- ally do not need this routine.</p>

<p>void xprt_unregister(SVCXPRT *xprt);</p>

<p>Before an RPC service transport handle is destroyed, it
should unregister itself with the RPC service package. This
routine modifies the global variable svc_fds. Service
implementors usu- ally do not need this routine.</p>
