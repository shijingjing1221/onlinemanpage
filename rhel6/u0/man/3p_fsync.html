<p>FSYNC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSYNC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fsync - synchronize changes to a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fsync(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fsync() function shall request that all
data for the open file descriptor named by fildes is to be
transferred to the storage device associated with the file
described by fildes in an implementation- defined manner.
The fsync() function shall not return until the system has
completed that action or until an error is detected.</p>

<p>If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the fsync()
function shall force all currently queued I/O operations
associated with the file indicated by file descriptor fildes
to the synchronized I/O completion state. All I/O operations
shall be completed as defined for synchronized I/O file
integrity completion.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fsync() shall
return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error. If the fsync() func- tion fails,
outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been
completed.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fsync() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>EINTR The fsync() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The fildes argument does not refer to a file on
which this oper- ation is possible.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,
fsync() shall return the error conditions defined for read()
and write().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The fsync() function should be used by
programs which require modifica- tions to a file to be
completed before continuing; for example, a pro- gram which
contains a simple transaction facility might use it to
ensure that all modifications to a file or files caused by a
transac- tion are recorded.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The fsync() function is intended to force a
physical write of data from the buffer cache, and to assure
that after a system crash or other failure that all data up
to the time of the fsync() call is recorded on the disk.
Since the concepts of &quot;buffer cache&quot;, &quot;system
crash&quot;, &quot;physi- cal write&quot;, and
&quot;non-volatile storage&quot; are not defined here, the
word- ing has to be more abstract.</p>

<p>If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is not defined, the wording
relies heavily on the conformance document to tell the user
what can be expected from the system. It is explicitly
intended that a null implementation is permit- ted. This
could be valid in the case where the system cannot assure
non-volatile storage under any circumstances or when the
system is highly fault-tolerant and the functionality is not
required. In the middle ground between these extremes,
fsync() might or might not actu- ally cause data to be
written where it is safe from a power failure. The
conformance document should identify at least that one
configura- tion exists (and how to obtain that
configuration) where this can be assured for at least some
files that the user can select to use for critical data. It
is not intended that an exhaustive list is required, but
rather sufficient information is provided so that if
critical data needs to be saved, the user can determine how
the system is to be con- figured to allow the data to be
written to non-volatile storage.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to assert that the key aspects of
fsync() are unrea- sonable to test in a test suite. That
does not make the function any less valuable, just more
difficult to test. A formal conformance test should probably
force a system crash (power shutdown) during the test for
this condition, but it needs to be done in such a way that
auto- mated testing does not require this to be done except
when a formal record of the results is being made. It would
also not be unreasonable to omit testing for fsync(),
allowing it to be treated as a quality-of- implementation
issue.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
