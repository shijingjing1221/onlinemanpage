<p>NAME XConfigureEvent - ConfigureNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for ConfigureNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* ConfigureNotify */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window event; Window window; int x, y; int
width, height; int border_width; Window above; Bool
override_redirect; } XConfigureEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The event member is set either to the reconfigured
window or to its parent, depending on whether
StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected. The
window member is set to the window whose size, position,
border, and/or stacking order was changed.</p>

<p>The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative
to the parent windows origin and indicate the position of
the upper-left outside corner of the window. The width and
height members are set to the inside size of the window, not
including the border. The border_width member is set to the
width of the window s border, in pixels.</p>

<p>The above member is set to the sibling window and is
used for stacking operations. If the X server sets this
member to None, the window whose state was changed is on the
bottom of the stack with respect to sibling windows.
However, if this member is set to a sibling window, the win-
dow whose state was changed is placed on top of this sibling
window.</p>

<p>The override_redirect member is set to the
override-redirect attribute of the window. Window manager
clients normally should ignore this win- dow if the
override_redirect member is True.</p>
