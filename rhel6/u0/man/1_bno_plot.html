<p>BNO_PLOT(1) BNO_PLOT(1)</p>

<p>NAME bno_plot - generate interactive 3D plot of IO
blocks and sizes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bno_plot [ -h | --help ] [ -v | --verbose ] [
-K | --keys-below ] [ &lt;file...&gt; ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bno_plot is a visualization tool for the
block layer IO tracing tool called blktrace(8). As noted in
its documentation, blktrace is a block layer IO tracing
mechanism which provides detailed information about request
queue operations up to user space.</p>

<p>bno_plot utilizes gnuplot to generate a 3D plot of the
block number output from btt. If no &lt;files&gt; are
specified, it will utilize all files generated after btt was
run with -B blknos (meaning: all files of the form
blknos*[rw].dat).</p>

<p>The -K option forces bno_plot to put the keys below the
graph. If it is not specified, all keys for input files are
put in the upper right corner of the graph. If the number of
devices exceed 10, then bno_plot will automatically push the
keys under the graph.</p>

<p>To use this utility, the gnuplot package needs to be
installed.</p>

<p>To exit the plotter, enter quit or ^D at the gnuplot&gt;
prompt.</p>

<p>AUTHORS bno_plot was written by Alan D. Brunelle. This
man page was created from the blktrace documentation by Bas
Zoetekouw.</p>
