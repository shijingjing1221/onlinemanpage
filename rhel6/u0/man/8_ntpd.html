<p>DESCRIPTION The ntpd program is an operating system
daemon which sets and maintains the system time of day in
synchronism with Internet standard time servers. It is a
complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as
defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by
RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. ntpd does most
computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does
relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point opera- tions only when
necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232
picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not achievable
with ordi- nary workstations and networks of today, it may
be required with future gigahertz CPU clocks and gigabit
LANs.</p>

<p>HOW NTP OPERATES The ntpd program operates by exchanging
messages with one or more con- figured servers at designated
poll intervals. When started, whether for the first or
subsequent times, the program requires several exchanges
from the majority of these servers so the signal processing
and mitiga- tion algorithms can accumulate and groom the
data and set the clock. In order to protect the network from
bursts, the initial poll interval for each server is delayed
an interval randomized over a few seconds. At the default
initial poll interval of 64s, several minutes can elapse
before the clock is set. The initial delay to set the clock
can be reduced using the iburst keyword with the server
configuration command, as described on the Configuration
Options page.</p>

<p>Most operating systems and hardware of today incorporate
a time-of-year (TOY) chip to maintain the time during
periods when the power is off. When the machine is booted,
the chip is used to initialize the operat- ing system time.
After the machine has synchronized to a NTP server, the
operating system corrects the chip from time to time. In
case there is no TOY chip or for some reason its time is
more than 1000s from the server time, ntpd assumes something
must be terribly wrong and the only reliable action is for
the operator to intervene and set the clock by hand. This
causes ntpd to exit with a panic message to the system log.
The -g option overrides this check and the clock will be set
to the server time regardless of the chip time. However, and
to protect against broken hardware, such as when the CMOS
battery fails or the clock counter becomes defective, once
the clock has been set, an error greater than 1000s will
cause ntpd to exit anyway.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions, ntpd adjusts the clock in
small steps so that the timescale is effectively continuous
and without discontinu- ities. Under conditions of extreme
network congestion, the roundtrip delay jitter can exceed
three seconds and the synchronization distance, which is
equal to one-half the roundtrip delay plus error budget
terms, can become very large. The ntpd algorithms discard
sample offsets exceeding 128 ms, unless the interval during
which no sample offset is less than 128 ms exceeds 900s. The
first sample after that, no matter what the offset, steps
the clock to the indicated time. In practice this reduces
the false alarm rate where the clock is stepped in error to
a vanishingly low incidence.</p>

<p>As the result of this behavior, once the clock has been
set, it very rarely strays more than 128 ms, even under
extreme cases of network path congestion and jitter.
Sometimes, in particular when ntpd is first started, the
error might exceed 128 ms. This may on occasion cause the
clock to be set backwards if the local clock time is more
than 128 s in the future relative to the server. In some
applications, this behavior may be unacceptable. If the -x
option is included on the command line, the clock will never
be stepped and only slew corrections will be used.</p>

<p>The issues should be carefully explored before deciding
to use the -x option. The maximum slew rate possible is
limited to 500 parts-per-mil- lion (PPM) as a consequence of
the correctness principles on which the NTP protocol and
algorithm design are based. As a result, the local clock can
take a long time to converge to an acceptable offset, about
2,000 s for each second the clock is outside the acceptable
range. Dur- ing this interval the local clock will not be
consistent with any other network clock and the system
cannot be used for distributed applica- tions that require
correctly synchronized network time.</p>

<p>In spite of the above precautions, sometimes when large
frequency errors are present the resulting time offsets
stray outside the 128-ms range and an eventual step or slew
time correction is required. If fol- lowing such a
correction the frequency error is so large that the first
sample is outside the acceptable range, ntpd enters the same
state as when the ntp.drift file is not present. The intent
of this behavior is to quickly correct the frequency and
restore operation to the normal tracking mode. In the most
extreme cases (time.ien.it comes to mind), there may be
occasional step/slew corrections and subsequent frequency
corrections. It helps in these cases to use the burst
keyword when con- figuring the server.</p>

<p>FREQUENCY DISCIPLINE The ntpd behavior at startup
depends on whether the frequency file, usually ntp.drift,
exists. This file contains the latest estimate of clock
frequency error. When the ntpd is started and the file does
not exist, the ntpd enters a special mode designed to
quickly adapt to the particular system clock oscillator time
and frequency error. This takes approximately 15 minutes,
after which the time and frequency are set to nominal values
and the ntpd enters normal mode, where the time and fre-
quency are continuously tracked relative to the server.
After one hour the frequency file is created and the current
frequency offset written to it. When the ntpd is started and
the file does exist, the ntpd fre- quency is initialized
from the file and enters normal mode immediately. After that
the current frequency offset is written to the file at
hourly intervals.</p>

<p>OPERATING MODES ntpd can operate in any of several
modes, including symmetric active/passive, client/server
broadcast/multicast and manycast, as described in the
Association Management page. It normally operates con-
tinuously while monitoring for small changes in frequency
and trimming the clock for the ultimate precision. However,
it can operate in a one- time mode where the time is set
from an external server and frequency is set from a
previously recorded frequency file. A broadcast/multicast or
manycast client can discover remote servers, compute
server-client propagation delay correction factors and
configure itself automati- cally. This makes it possible to
deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying
configuration details specific to the local environment.</p>

<p>By default, ntpd runs in continuous mode where each of
possibly several external servers is polled at intervals
determined by an intricate state machine. The state machine
measures the incidental roundtrip delay jitter and
oscillator frequency wander and determines the best poll
interval using a heuristic algorithm. Ordinarily, and in
most operating environments, the state machine will start
with 64s intervals and eventually increase in steps to
1024s. A small amount of random variation is introduced in
order to avoid bunching at the servers. In addition, should
a server become unreachable for some time, the poll interval
is increased in steps to 1024s in order to reduce network
overhead.</p>

<p>In some cases it may not be practical for ntpd to run
continuously. A common workaround has been to run the
ntpdate program from a cron job at designated times.
However, this program does not have the crafted signal
processing, error checking and mitigation algorithms of
ntpd. The -q option is intended for this purpose. Setting
this option will cause ntpd to exit just after setting the
clock for the first time with the configured servers. The
procedure for initially setting the clock is the same as in
continuous mode; most applications will probably want to
specify the iburst keyword with the server configuration
command. With this keyword a volley of messages are
exchanged to groom the data and the clock is set in about 10
s. If nothing is heard after a couple of minutes, the daemon
times out and exits. After a suitable period of mourning,
the ntpdate program may be retired.</p>

<p>When kernel support is available to discipline the clock
frequency, which is the case for stock Solaris, Tru64, Linux
and FreeBSD, a useful feature is available to discipline the
clock frequency. First, ntpd is run in continuous mode with
selected servers in order to measure and record the
intrinsic clock frequency offset in the frequency file. It
may take some hours for the frequency and offset to settle
down. Then the ntpd is stopped and run in one-time mode as
required. At each startup, the frequency is read from the
file and initializes the kernel frequency.</p>

<p>POLL INTERVAL CONTROL This version of NTP includes an
intricate state machine to reduce the network load while
maintaining a quality of synchronization consistent with the
observed jitter and wander. There are a number of ways to
tai- lor the operation in order enhance accuracy by reducing
the interval or to reduce network overhead by increasing it.
However, the user is advised to carefully consider the
consequences of changing the poll adjustment range from the
default minimum of 64 s to the default maxi- mum of 1,024 s.
The default minimum can be changed with the tinker min- poll
command to a value not less than 16 s. This value is used
for all configured associations, unless overridden by the
minpoll option on the configuration command. Note that most
device drivers will not operate properly if the poll
interval is less than 64 s and that the broadcast server and
manycast client associations will also use the default,
unless overridden.</p>

<p>In some cases involving dial up or toll services, it may
be useful to increase the minimum interval to a few tens of
minutes and maximum interval to a day or so. Under normal
operation conditions, once the clock discipline loop has
stabilized the interval will be increased in steps from the
minimum to the maximum. However, this assumes the intrinsic
clock frequency error is small enough for the discipline
loop correct it. The capture range of the loop is 500 PPM at
an interval of 64s decreasing by a factor of two for each
doubling of interval. At a minimum of 1,024 s, for example,
the capture range is only 31 PPM. If the intrinsic error is
greater than this, the drift file ntp.drift will have to be
specially tailored to reduce the residual error below this
limit. Once this is done, the drift file is automatically
updated once per hour and is available to initialize the
frequency on subsequent daemon restarts.</p>

<p>THE HUFF--PUFF FILTER In scenarios where a considerable
amount of data are to be downloaded or uploaded over
telephone modems, timekeeping quality can be seriously
degraded. This occurs because the differential delays on the
two direc- tions of transmission can be quite large. In many
cases the apparent time errors are so large as to exceed the
step threshold and a step correction can occur during and
after the data transfer is in progress.</p>

<p>The huff-n-puff filter is designed to correct the
apparent time offset in these cases. It depends on knowledge
of the propagation delay when no other traffic is present.
In common scenarios this occurs during other than work
hours. The filter maintains a shift register that remembers
the minimum delay over the most recent interval measured
usu- ally in hours. Under conditions of severe delay, the
filter corrects the apparent offset using the sign of the
offset and the difference between the apparent delay and
minimum delay. The name of the filter reflects the negative
(huff) and positive (puff) correction, which depends on the
sign of the offset.</p>

<p>The filter is activated by the tinker command and
huffpuff keyword, as described in the Miscellaneous Options
page.</p>

<p>NOTES If NetInfo support is built into ntpd, then ntpd
will attempt to read its configuration from the NetInfo if
the default ntp.conf file cannot be read and no file is
specified by the -c option.</p>

<p>In contexts where a host name is expected, a -4
qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to
the IPv4 namespace, while a -6 qual- ifier forces DNS
resolution to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p>Various internal ntpd variables can be displayed and
configuration options altered while the ntpd is running
using the ntpq and ntpdc utility programs.</p>

<p>When ntpd starts it looks at the value of umask, and if
zero ntpd will set the umask to 022.</p>

<p>Unless the -n, -d or -D option is used, ntpd changes the
current work- ing directory to the root directory, so any
options or commands speci- fying paths need to use an
absolute path or a path relative to the root.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -4 Force DNS resolution of host
names to the IPv4 namespace.</p>

<p>-6 Force DNS resolution of host names to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p>-a Require cryptographic authentication for broadcast
client, mul- ticast client and symmetric passive
associations. This is the default.</p>

<p>-A Do not require cryptographic authentication for
broadcast client, multicast client and symmetric passive
associations. This is almost never a good idea.</p>

<p>-b Enable the client to synchronize to broadcast
servers.</p>

<p>-c conffile Specify the name and path of the
configuration file, default /etc/ntp.conf.</p>

<p>-d Specify debugging mode. This option may occur more
than once, with each occurrence indicating greater detail of
display.</p>

<p>-D level Specify debugging level directly.</p>

<p>-f driftfile Specify the name and path of the frequency
file. This is the same operation as the driftfile driftfile
configuration com- mand.</p>

<p>-g Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log
if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s
by default. This option allows the time to be set to any
value without restriction; however, this can happen only
once. If the thresh- old is exceeded after that, ntpd will
exit with a message to the system log. This option can be
used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for
other options.</p>

<p>-i jaildir Chroot the server to the directory jaildir.
This option also implies that the server attempts to drop
root privileges at startup (otherwise, chroot gives very
little additional secu- rity), and it is only available if
the OS supports to run the server without full root
privileges. You may need to also spec- ify a -u option.</p>

<p>-I iface Listen on interface. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p>-k keyfile Specify the name and path of the symmetric
key file. This is the same operation as the keys keyfile
configuration command.</p>

<p>-l logfile Specify the name and path of the log file.
The default is the system log file. This is the same
operation as the logfile log- file configuration
command.</p>

<p>-L Do not listen to virtual IPs. The default is to
listen.</p>

<p>-m Lock memory.</p>

<p>-n Dont fork.</p>

<p>-N To the extent permitted by the operating system, run
the ntpd at the highest priority.</p>

<p>-p pidfile Specify the name and path of the file used to
record the ntpd process ID. This is the same operation as
the pidfile pidfile configuration command.</p>

<p>-P priority To the extent permitted by the operating
system, run the ntpd at the specified priority.</p>

<p>-q Exit the ntpd just after the first time the clock is
set. This behavior mimics that of the ntpdate program, which
is to be retired. The -g and -x options can be used with
this option. Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled
with this option.</p>

<p>-r broadcastdelay Specify the default propagation delay
from the broadcast/multi- cast server to this client. This
is necessary only if the delay cannot be computed
automatically by the protocol.</p>

<p>-s statsdir Specify the directory path for files created
by the statistics facility. This is the same operation as
the statsdir statsdir configuration command.</p>

<p>-t key Add a key number to the trusted key list. This
option can occur more than once.</p>

<p>-u user[:group] Specify a user, and optionally a group,
to switch to. This option is only available if the OS
supports to run the server without full root privileges.
Currently, this option is sup- ported under NetBSD
(configure with --enable-clockctl) and Linux (configure with
--enable-linuxcaps).</p>

<p>-U interface update interval Number of seconds to wait
between interface list scans to pick up new and delete
network interface. Set to 0 to disable dynamic interface
list updating. The default is to scan every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>-v variable</p>

<p>-V variable Add a system variable listed by default.</p>

<p>-x Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less
than the step threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and
stepped if above the threshold. This option sets the
threshold to 600 s, which is well within the accuracy window
to set the clock manu- ally. Note: Since the slew rate of
typical Unix kernels is lim- ited to 0.5 ms/s, each second
of adjustment requires an amorti- zation interval of 2000 s.
Thus, an adjustment as much as 600 s will take almost 14
days to complete. This option can be used with the -g and -q
options. See the tinker command for other options. Note: The
kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.</p>

<p>THE CONFIGURATION FILE Ordinarily, ntpd reads the
ntp.conf configuration file at startup time in order to
determine the synchronization sources and operating modes.
It is also possible to specify a working, although limited,
configura- tion entirely on the command line, obviating the
need for a configura- tion file. This may be particularly
useful when the local host is to be configured as a
broadcast/multicast client, with all peers being deter-
mined by listening to broadcasts at run time.</p>

<p>Usually, the configuration file is installed in the /etc
directory, but could be installed elsewhere (see the -c
conffile command line option). The file format is similar to
other Unix configuration files - comments begin with a #
character and extend to the end of the line; blank lines are
ignored.</p>

<p>Configuration commands consist of an initial keyword
followed by a list of arguments, some of which may be
optional, separated by whitespace. Commands may not be
continued over multiple lines. Arguments may be host names,
host addresses written in numeric, dotted-quad form, inte-
gers, floating point numbers (when specifying times in
seconds) and text strings. Optional arguments are delimited
by [ ] in the following descriptions, while alternatives are
separated by |. The notation [ ... ] means an optional,
indefinite repetition of the last item before the [ ...
].</p>

<p>EXIT CODES A non-zero exit code indicates an error. Any
error messages are logged to the system log by default.</p>

<p>The exit code is 0 only when ntpd is terminated by a
signal, or when the -q option is used and ntpd successfully
sets the system clock.</p>
