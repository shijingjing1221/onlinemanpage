<p>MQ_RECEIVE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
MQ_RECEIVE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mq_receive, mq_timedreceive - receive a message
from a message queue (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr, size_t
msg_len, unsigned *msg_prio);</p>

<p>#include &lt;mqueue.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;
ssize_t mq_timedreceive(mqd_t mqdes, char *restrict msg_ptr,
size_t msg_len, unsigned *restrict msg_prio, const struct
timespec *restrict abs_timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mq_receive() function shall receive the
oldest of the highest pri- ority message(s) from the message
queue specified by mqdes. If the size of the buffer in
bytes, specified by the msg_len argument, is less than the
mq_msgsize attribute of the message queue, the function
shall fail and return an error. Otherwise, the selected
message shall be removed from the queue and copied to the
buffer pointed to by the msg_ptr argu- ment.</p>

<p>If the value of msg_len is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
result is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If the argument msg_prio is not NULL, the priority of
the selected mes- sage shall be stored in the location
referenced by msg_prio.</p>

<p>If the specified message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK
is not set in the message queue description associated with
mqdes, mq_receive() shall block until a message is enqueued
on the message queue or until mq_receive() is interrupted by
a signal. If more than one thread is waiting to receive a
message when a message arrives at an empty queue and the
Priority Scheduling option is supported, then the thread of
highest priority that has been waiting the longest shall be
selected to receive the message. Otherwise, it is
unspecified which waiting thread receives the message. If
the specified message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK is set
in the message queue description associated with mqdes, no
message shall be removed from the queue, and mq_receive()
shall return an error.</p>

<p>The mq_timedreceive() function shall receive the oldest
of the highest priority messages from the message queue
specified by mqdes as described for the mq_receive()
function. However, if O_NONBLOCK was not specified when the
message queue was opened via the mq_open() function, and no
message exists on the queue to satisfy the receive, the wait
for such a message shall be terminated when the specified
timeout expires. If O_NONBLOCK is set, this function is
equivalent to mq_receive().</p>

<p>The timeout expires when the absolute time specified by
abs_timeout passes, as measured by the clock on which
timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock
equals or exceeds abs_timeout), or if the absolute time
specified by abs_timeout has already been passed at the time
of the call.</p>

<p>If the Timers option is supported, the timeout shall be
based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock; if the Timers option is
not supported, the time- out shall be based on the system
clock as returned by the time() func- tion.</p>

<p>The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of
the clock on which it is based. The timespec argument is
defined in the &lt;time.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>Under no circumstance shall the operation fail with a
timeout if a mes- sage can be removed from the message queue
immediately. The validity of the abs_timeout parameter need
not be checked if a message can be removed from the message
queue immediately.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
mq_receive() and mq_timedreceive() functions shall return
the length of the selected message in bytes and the message
shall be removed from the queue. Otherwise, no message shall
be removed from the queue, the functions shall return a
value of -1, and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mq_receive() and mq_timedreceive() functions
shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN O_NONBLOCK was set in the message description
associated with mqdes, and the specified message queue is
empty.</p>

<p>EBADF The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue
descriptor open for reading.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The specified message buffer size, msg_len, is
less than the message size attribute of the message
queue.</p>

<p>EINTR The mq_receive() or mq_timedreceive() operation
was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The process or thread would have blocked, and the
abs_timeout parameter specified a nanoseconds field value
less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The O_NONBLOCK flag was not set when the
message queue was opened, but no message arrived on the
queue before the specified timeout expired.</p>

<p>The mq_receive() and mq_timedreceive() functions may
fail if:</p>

<p>EBADMSG The implementation has detected a data
corruption problem with the message.</p>
