<p>NAME xmbind Configures virtual key bindings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmbind [options ] [file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xmbind is an X Window System client that
configures the virtual key bindings for Motif applications.
This action is performed by mwm at its startup, so the
xmbind client is only needed when mwm is not in use, or when
you want to change bindings without restarting mwm. If a
file is specified, its contents are used as the virtual key
bindings. If a file is not specified, the file .motifbind in
the users home directory is used. If this file is not found,
xmbind loads the default virtual key bindings, as described
in VirtualBindings(3).</p>

<p>Options -display This option specifies the display to
use; see X(1).</p>
