<p>NAME curl-config - Get information about a libcurl
installation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS curl-config [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl-config displays information about the
curl and libcurl installa- tion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --ca Displays the built-in path to the CA cert
bundle this libcurl uses.</p>

<p>--cc Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.</p>

<p>--cflags Set of compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when
compiling files that use libcurl. Currently that is only the
include path to the curl include files.</p>

<p>--checkfor [version] Specify the oldest possible libcurl
version string you want, and this script will return 0 if
the current installation is new enough or it returns 1 and
outputs a text saying that the cur- rent version is not new
enough. (Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p>--feature Lists what particular main features the
installed libcurl was built with. At the time of writing,
this list may include SSL, KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume any
particular order. The keywords will be separated by
newlines. There may be none, one, or sev- eral keywords in
the list.</p>

<p>--help Displays the available options.</p>

<p>--libs Shows the complete set of libs and other linker
options you will need in order to link your application with
libcurl.</p>

<p>--prefix This is the prefix used when libcurl was
installed. Libcurl is then installed in $prefix/lib and its
header files are installed in $prefix/include and so on. The
prefix is set with &quot;configure --prefix&quot;.</p>

<p>--protocols Lists what particular protocols the
installed libcurl was built to support. At the time of
writing, this list may include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FILE,
TELNET, LDAP, DICT. Do not assume any particular order. The
protocols will be listed using uppercase and are separated
by newlines. There may be none, one, or sev- eral protocols
in the list. (Added in 7.13.0)</p>

<p>--static-libs Shows the complete set of libs and other
linker options you will need in order to link your
application with libcurl statically. (Added in 7.17.1)</p>

<p>--version Outputs version information about the
installed libcurl.</p>

<p>--vernum Outputs version information about the installed
libcurl, in numerical mode. This outputs the version number,
in hexadecimal, with 8 bits for each part; major, minor,
patch. So that libcurl 7.7.4 would appear as 070704 and
libcurl 12.13.14 would appear as 0c0d0e... Note that the
initial zero might be omitted. (This option was broken in
the 7.15.0 release.)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES What linker options do I need when I link with
libcurl?</p>

<p>$ curl-config --libs</p>

<p>What compiler options do I need when I compile using
libcurl functions?</p>

<p>$ curl-config --cflags</p>

<p>How do I know if libcurl was built with SSL support?</p>

<p>$ curl-config --feature | grep SSL</p>

<p>Whats the installed libcurl version?</p>

<p>$ curl-config --version</p>

<p>How do I build a single file with a one-line
command?</p>

<p>$ curl-config --cc --cflags --libs -o example
example.c</p>
