<p>NAME pbmtoepsi - convert a PBM image to an encapsulated
PostScript style preview bitmap</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtoepsi [-dpi=N[xN]] [-bbonly] [pbmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Reads a PBM image as input. Produces an encapsulated
Postscript style bitmap as output. The output is not a stand
alone postscript file, it is only a preview bitmap, which
can be included in an encapsulated PostScript file.</p>

<p>pbmtoepsi assumes the PBM input describes a whole output
page, with one pixel on the page corresponding to one PBM
pixel. It detects white borders in the image and generates
Postscript output that contains a Bounding Box statement to
describe the location of the principal image (the image
excluding the white borders) on the page and thus does not
include the borders in the raster part of the Postscript
output.</p>

<p>There is no epsitopbm tool - this transformation is one
way.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -dpi=N[xN]</p>

<p>This option specifies the resolution in dots per inch of
the ultimate output device. You must specify this because
the Bounding Box statement defines the bounding box in
absolute distances, not in pixels. pbmtoepsi assumes in
calculating the bounding box that each PBM pixel will become
one dot on the output device, and applies your dpi
specification to calculate the size and location on the page
of the bounding box.</p>

<p>If you specify NxN, the first number is the horizontal
resolution and the second number is the vertical resolution.
If you specify just a single number N, that is the
resolution in both directions.</p>

<p>The default is 72 dots per inch in both directions.</p>

<p>This option was new In Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002). Before
that, pbmtoepsi always assumed 72 dots per inch in both
direc- tions.</p>

<p>-bbonly Only create a boundary box, dont fill it with
the image.</p>
