IEEE1284_GET_IRQ_FD(3)</p>

<p>NAME ieee1284_get_irq_fd, ieee1284_clear_irq - interrupt
notification</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ieee1284.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ieee1284_get_irq_fd(struct parport *port);</p>

<p>int ieee1284_clear_irq(struct parport *port, unsigned
int *count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the port has a configured interrupt line
and the port type supports interrupt notification, it is
possible to obtain a file descriptor that may be used for
select(2) or poll(2). Any event (readable, writable or
exception) means that an interrupt has been triggered. No
operations other than select or poll may be performed on the
file descriptor.</p>

<p>The port must be open in order to call
ieee1284_get_irq_fd, and must be claimed when using select
or poll.</p>

<p>The caller must not close the file descriptor, and may
not use it at all when the port is not claimed.</p>

<p>When an interrupt has been detected, the caller must
call ieee1284_clear_irq to clear the interrupt condition, at
which point the number of interrupts raised can be obtained
by supplying a non-NULL count.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE For ieee1284_get_irq_fd: If the return
value is negative then it is an error code listed below.
Otherwise it is a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>E1284_NOTAVAIL No such file descriptor is available.</p>

<p>E1284_INVALIDPORT The port parameter is invalid (for
instance, perhaps the port is not open).</p>

<p>For ieee1284_clear_irq:</p>

<p>E1284_OK The interrupt has been cleared. If count was
not NULL the count of interrupts has been atomically stored
to count and reset.</p>

<p>E1284_NOTAVAIL The count parameter was not NULL but
interrupt counting is not supported on this type of port.
The interrupt has been cleared.</p>

<p>E1284_SYS There was a problem clearing the
interrupt.</p>

<p>E1284_INVALIDPORT The port parameter is invalid (for
instance, perhaps the port is not claimed).</p>
