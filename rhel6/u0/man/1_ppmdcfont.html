<p>NAME ppmdcfont - Turn a Ppmdfont file into C source for
a builtin font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmdcfont</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>(There are no arguments or options)</p>

<p>ppmdcfont creates a C source file that you can compile
into a built-in font for use with the Netpbm PPM drawing
facilities. It reads a Ppmd- font file on Standard Input and
writes the C source code to Standard Output.</p>

<p>The output C source code has the font object s name
hardcoded as ppmd_standardfont, which you will definitely
want to edit, because that is the name of the font built in
to libnetpbm. If you don t change it, it will conflict both
cognitively and in program linking. There should obviously
be an option on ppmdcfont to choose this, but the
development effort has not been justified so far.</p>

<p>See LibnetpbmPPMDrawingFunction Manual (1) for details
on Ppmdfont files.</p>
