<p>READLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual READLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME readlink - read the contents of a symbolic link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t readlink(const char *restrict path, char
*restrict buf, size_t bufsize);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The readlink() function shall place the
contents of the symbolic link referred to by path in the
buffer buf which has size bufsize. If the number of bytes in
the symbolic link is less than bufsize, the contents of the
remainder of buf are unspecified. If the buf argument is not
large enough to contain the link content, the first bufsize
bytes shall be placed in buf.</p>

<p>If the value of bufsize is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
result is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, readlink()
shall return the count of bytes placed in the buffer.
Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1, leave the buffer
unchanged, and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The readlink() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix of path.</p>

<p>EINVAL The path argument names a file that is not a
symbolic link.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>The readlink() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Read permission is denied for the directory.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Reading the Name of a Symbolic Link The
following example shows how to read the name of a symbolic
link named /modules/pass1.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char buf[1024]; ssizet_t len; ... if ((len =
readlink(&quot;/modules/pass1&quot;, buf, sizeof(buf)-1)) !=
-1) buf[len] ;</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Conforming applications should not
assume that the returned contents of the symbolic link are
null-terminated.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not require
any association of file times with symbolic links, there is
no requirement that file times be updated by readlink(). The
type associated with bufsiz is a size_t in order to be
consistent with both the ISO C standard and the definition
of read(). The behavior specified for readlink() when bufsiz
is zero represents historical practice. For this case, the
standard developers considered a change whereby readlink()
would return the number of non- null bytes contained in the
symbolic link with the buffer buf remaining unchanged;
however, since the stat structure member st_size value can
be used to determine the size of buffer necessary to contain
the con- tents of the symbolic link as returned by
readlink(), this proposal was rejected, and the historical
practice retained.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
