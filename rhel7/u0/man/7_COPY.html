<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COPY</b>
moves data between PostgreSQL tables and standard
file&minus;system files. <b>COPY TO</b> copies the contents
of a table <i>to</i> a file, while <b>COPY FROM</b> copies
data <i>from</i> a file to a table (appending the data to
whatever is in the table already). <b>COPY TO</b> can also
copy the results of a <b>SELECT</b> query.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a list of
columns is specified, <b>COPY</b> will only copy the data in
the specified columns to or from the file. If there are any
columns in the table that are not in the column list,
<b>COPY FROM</b> will insert the default values for those
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COPY</b>
with a file name instructs the PostgreSQL server to directly
read from or write to a file. The file must be accessible to
the server and the name must be specified from the viewpoint
of the server. When STDIN or STDOUT is specified, data is
transmitted via the connection between the client and the
server.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of an existing table.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>column_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An optional list of columns to
be copied. If no column list is specified, all columns of
the table will be copied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>query</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>SELECT</b>(7) or
<b>VALUES</b>(7) command whose results are to be copied.
Note that parentheses are required around the query.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The absolute path name of the
input or output file. Windows users might need to use an E''
string and double any backslashes used in the path name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">STDIN</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies that input comes from
the client application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">STDOUT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies that output goes to
the client application.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>boolean</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies whether the selected
option should be turned on or off. You can write TRUE, ON,
or 1 to enable the option, and FALSE, OFF, or 0 to disable
it. The <i>boolean</i> value can also be omitted, in which
case TRUE is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FORMAT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Selects the data format to be
read or written: text, csv (Comma Separated Values), or
binary. The default is text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OIDS</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies copying the OID for
each row. (An error is raised if OIDS is specified for a
table that does not have OIDs, or in the case of copying a
<i>query</i>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DELIMITER</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the character that
separates columns within each row (line) of the file. The
default is a tab character in text format, a comma in CSV
format. This must be a single one&minus;byte character. This
option is not allowed when using binary format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NULL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the string that
represents a null value. The default is \N
(backslash&minus;N) in text format, and an unquoted empty
string in CSV format. You might prefer an empty string even
in text format for cases where you don't want to distinguish
nulls from empty strings. This option is not allowed when
using binary format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
When using <b>COPY FROM</b>, any data item that matches this
string will be stored as a null value, so you should make
sure that you use the same string as you used with <b>COPY
TO</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>HEADER</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Specifies that the file
contains a header line with the names of each column in the
file. On output, the first line contains the column names
from the table, and on input, the first line is ignored.
This option is allowed only when using CSV format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>QUOTE</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Specifies the quoting
character to be used when a data value is quoted. The
default is double&minus;quote. This must be a single
one&minus;byte character. This option is allowed only when
using CSV format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>ESCAPE</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Specifies the character
that should appear before a data character that matches the
QUOTE value. The default is the same as the QUOTE value (so
that the quoting character is doubled if it appears in the
data). This must be a single one&minus;byte character. This
option is allowed only when using CSV format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>FORCE_QUOTE</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Forces quoting to be used
for all non&minus;NULL values in each specified column. NULL
output is never quoted. If * is specified, non&minus;NULL
values will be quoted in all columns. This option is allowed
only in <b>COPY TO</b>, and only when using CSV
format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>FORCE_NOT_NULL</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Do not match the specified
columns' values against the null string. In the default case
where the null string is empty, this means that empty values
will be read as zero&minus;length strings rather than nulls,
even when they are not quoted. This option is allowed only
in <b>COPY FROM</b>, and only when using CSV
format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>ENCODING</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Specifies that the file is
encoded in the <i>encoding_name</i>. If this option is
omitted, the current client encoding is used. See the Notes
below for more details.</big></p>

<h2>OUTPUTS
<a name="OUTPUTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>On
successful completion, a <b>COPY</b> command returns a
command tag of the form</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>COPY
<i>count</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<i>count</i> is the number of rows copied.</big></p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY</b>
can only be used with plain tables, not with views. However,
you can write COPY (SELECT * FROM <i>viewname</i>) TO
....</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY</b>
only deals with the specific table named; it does not copy
data to or from child tables. Thus for example COPY
<i>table</i> TO shows the same data as SELECT * FROM ONLY
<i>table</i>. But COPY (SELECT * FROM <i>table</i>) TO ...
can be used to dump all of the data in an inheritance
hierarchy.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>You must
have select privilege on the table whose values are read by
<b>COPY TO</b>, and insert privilege on the table into which
values are inserted by <b>COPY FROM</b>. It is sufficient to
have column privileges on the column(s) listed in the
command.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Files
named in a <b>COPY</b> command are read or written directly
by the server, not by the client application. Therefore,
they must reside on or be accessible to the database server
machine, not the client. They must be accessible to and
readable or writable by the PostgreSQL user (the user ID the
server runs as), not the client. <b>COPY</b> naming a file
is only allowed to database superusers, since it allows
reading or writing any file that the server has privileges
to access.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Do not
confuse <b>COPY</b> with the psql instruction <b>\copy</b>.
<b>\copy</b> invokes <b>COPY FROM STDIN</b> or <b>COPY TO
STDOUT</b>, and then fetches/stores the data in a file
accessible to the psql client. Thus, file accessibility and
access rights depend on the client rather than the server
when <b>\copy</b> is used.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It is
recommended that the file name used in <b>COPY</b> always be
specified as an absolute path. This is enforced by the
server in the case of <b>COPY TO</b>, but for <b>COPY
FROM</b> you do have the option of reading from a file
specified by a relative path. The path will be interpreted
relative to the working directory of the server process
(normally the cluster's data directory), not the client's
working directory.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY
FROM</b> will invoke any triggers and check constraints on
the destination table. However, it will not invoke
rules.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY</b>
input and output is affected by <i>DateStyle</i>. To ensure
portability to other PostgreSQL installations that might use
non&minus;default <i>DateStyle</i> settings,
<i>DateStyle</i> should be set to ISO before using <b>COPY
TO</b>. It is also a good idea to avoid dumping data with
<i>IntervalStyle</i> set to sql_standard, because negative
interval values might be misinterpreted by a server that has
a different setting for <i>IntervalStyle</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Input data
is interpreted according to ENCODING option or the current
client encoding, and output data is encoded in ENCODING or
the current client encoding, even if the data does not pass
through the client but is read from or written to a file
directly by the server.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY</b>
stops operation at the first error. This should not lead to
problems in the event of a <b>COPY TO</b>, but the target
table will already have received earlier rows in a <b>COPY
FROM</b>. These rows will not be visible or accessible, but
they still occupy disk space. This might amount to a
considerable amount of wasted disk space if the failure
happened well into a large copy operation. You might wish to
invoke <b>VACUUM</b> to recover the wasted space.</big></p>

<h2>FILE FORMATS
<a name="FILE FORMATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Text
Format</b> <br>
When the text format is used, the data read or written is a
text file with one line per table row. Columns in a row are
separated by the delimiter character. The column values
themselves are strings generated by the output function, or
acceptable to the input function, of each attribute's data
type. The specified null string is used in place of columns
that are null. <b>COPY FROM</b> will raise an error if any
line of the input file contains more or fewer columns than
are expected. If OIDS is specified, the OID is read or
written as the first column, preceding the user data
columns.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>End of
data can be represented by a single line containing just
backslash&minus;period (\.). An end&minus;of&minus;data
marker is not necessary when reading from a file, since the
end of file serves perfectly well; it is needed only when
copying data to or from client applications using
pre&minus;3.0 client protocol.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Backslash
characters (\) can be used in the <b>COPY</b> data to quote
data characters that might otherwise be taken as row or
column delimiters. In particular, the following characters
<i>must</i> be preceded by a backslash if they appear as
part of a column value: backslash itself, newline, carriage
return, and the current delimiter character.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
specified null string is sent by <b>COPY TO</b> without
adding any backslashes; conversely, <b>COPY FROM</b> matches
the input against the null string before removing
backslashes. Therefore, a null string such as \N cannot be
confused with the actual data value \N (which would be
represented as \\N).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
following special backslash sequences are recognized by
<b>COPY FROM</b>:</big></p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><big><img src="grohtml-172121.png" alt="Image grohtml-172121.png"></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><big>Presently, <b>COPY TO</b>
will never emit an octal or hex&minus;digits backslash
sequence, but it does use the other sequences listed above
for those control characters.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Any other
backslashed character that is not mentioned in the above
table will be taken to represent itself. However, beware of
adding backslashes unnecessarily, since that might
accidentally produce a string matching the
end&minus;of&minus;data marker (\.) or the null string (\N
by default). These strings will be recognized before any
other backslash processing is done.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It is
strongly recommended that applications generating
<b>COPY</b> data convert data newlines and carriage returns
to the \n and \r sequences respectively. At present it is
possible to represent a data carriage return by a backslash
and carriage return, and to represent a data newline by a
backslash and newline. However, these representations might
not be accepted in future releases. They are also highly
vulnerable to corruption if the <b>COPY</b> file is
transferred across different machines (for example, from
Unix to Windows or vice versa).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>COPY
TO</b> will terminate each row with a Unix&minus;style
newline (&ldquo;\n&rdquo;). Servers running on Microsoft
Windows instead output carriage return/newline
(&ldquo;\r\n&rdquo;), but only for <b>COPY</b> to a server
file; for consistency across platforms, <b>COPY TO
STDOUT</b> always sends &ldquo;\n&rdquo; regardless of
server platform. <b>COPY FROM</b> can handle lines ending
with newlines, carriage returns, or carriage
return/newlines. To reduce the risk of error due to
un&minus;backslashed newlines or carriage returns that were
meant as data, <b>COPY FROM</b> will complain if the line
endings in the input are not all alike.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>CSV
Format</b> <br>
This format option is used for importing and exporting the
Comma Separated Value (CSV) file format used by many other
programs, such as spreadsheets. Instead of the escaping
rules used by PostgreSQL's standard text format, it produces
and recognizes the common CSV escaping mechanism.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The values
in each record are separated by the DELIMITER character. If
the value contains the delimiter character, the QUOTE
character, the NULL string, a carriage return, or line feed
character, then the whole value is prefixed and suffixed by
the QUOTE character, and any occurrence within the value of
a QUOTE character or the ESCAPE character is preceded by the
escape character. You can also use FORCE_QUOTE to force
quotes when outputting non&minus;NULL values in specific
columns.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The CSV
format has no standard way to distinguish a NULL value from
an empty string. PostgreSQL's <b>COPY</b> handles this by
quoting. A NULL is output as the NULL parameter string and
is not quoted, while a non&minus;NULL value matching the
NULL parameter string is quoted. For example, with the
default settings, a NULL is written as an unquoted empty
string, while an empty string data value is written with
double quotes (&quot;&quot;). Reading values follows similar
rules. You can use FORCE_NOT_NULL to prevent NULL input
comparisons for specific columns.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Because
backslash is not a special character in the CSV format, \.,
the end&minus;of&minus;data marker, could also appear as a
data value. To avoid any misinterpretation, a \. data value
appearing as a lone entry on a line is automatically quoted
on output, and on input, if quoted, is not interpreted as
the end&minus;of&minus;data marker. If you are loading a
file created by another application that has a single
unquoted column and might have a value of \., you might need
to quote that value in the input file.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
In CSV format, all characters are significant. A quoted
value surrounded by white space, or any characters other
than DELIMITER, will include those characters. This can
cause errors if you import data from a system that pads CSV
lines with white space out to some fixed width. If such a
situation arises you might need to preprocess the CSV file
to remove the trailing white space, before importing the
data into PostgreSQL.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
CSV format will both recognize and produce CSV files with
quoted values containing embedded carriage returns and line
feeds. Thus the files are not strictly one line per table
row like text&minus;format files.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
Many programs produce strange and occasionally perverse CSV
files, so the file format is more a convention than a
standard. Thus you might encounter some files that cannot be
imported using this mechanism, and <b>COPY</b> might produce
files that other programs cannot process.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Binary
Format</b> <br>
The binary format option causes all data to be stored/read
as binary format rather than as text. It is somewhat faster
than the text and CSV formats, but a binary&minus;format
file is less portable across machine architectures and
PostgreSQL versions. Also, the binary format is very data
type specific; for example it will not work to output binary
data from a smallint column and read it into an integer
column, even though that would work fine in text
format.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The binary
file format consists of a file header, zero or more tuples
containing the row data, and a file trailer. Headers and
data are in network byte order.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
PostgreSQL releases before 7.4 used a different binary file
format.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>File
Header</big></b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>The file header consists
of 15 bytes of fixed fields, followed by a
variable&minus;length header extension area. The fixed
fields are:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Signature</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>11&minus;byte sequence
PGCOPY\n\377\r\n\0 &mdash; note that the zero byte is a
required part of the signature. (The signature is designed
to allow easy identification of files that have been munged
by a non&minus;8&minus;bit&minus;clean transfer. This
signature will be changed by
end&minus;of&minus;line&minus;translation filters, dropped
zero bytes, dropped high bits, or parity changes.)</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Flags
field</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>32&minus;bit integer bit
mask to denote important aspects of the file format. Bits
are numbered from 0 (LSB) to 31 (MSB). Note that this field
is stored in network byte order (most significant byte
first), as are all the integer fields used in the file
format. Bits 16&minus;31 are reserved to denote critical
file format issues; a reader should abort if it finds an
unexpected bit set in this range. Bits 0&minus;15 are
reserved to signal backwards&minus;compatible format issues;
a reader should simply ignore any unexpected bits set in
this range. Currently only one flag bit is defined, and the
rest must be zero:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Bit
16</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><big>if 1, OIDs are included in
the data; if 0, not</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Header
extension area length</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>32&minus;bit integer,
length in bytes of remainder of header, not including self.
Currently, this is zero, and the first tuple follows
immediately. Future changes to the format might allow
additional data to be present in the header. A reader should
silently skip over any header extension data it does not
know what to do with.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The header
extension area is envisioned to contain a sequence of
self&minus;identifying chunks. The flags field is not
intended to tell readers what is in the extension area.
Specific design of header extension contents is left for a
later release.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
design allows for both backwards&minus;compatible header
additions (add header extension chunks, or set
low&minus;order flag bits) and
non&minus;backwards&minus;compatible changes (set
high&minus;order flag bits to signal such changes, and add
supporting data to the extension area if needed).</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Tuples</big></b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Each tuple begins with a
16&minus;bit integer count of the number of fields in the
tuple. (Presently, all tuples in a table will have the same
count, but that might not always be true.) Then, repeated
for each field in the tuple, there is a 32&minus;bit length
word followed by that many bytes of field data. (The length
word does not include itself, and can be zero.) As a special
case, &minus;1 indicates a NULL field value. No value bytes
follow in the NULL case.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>There is
no alignment padding or any other extra data between
fields.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Presently,
all data values in a binary&minus;format file are assumed to
be in binary format (format code one). It is anticipated
that a future extension might add a header field that allows
per&minus;column format codes to be specified.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>To
determine the appropriate binary format for the actual tuple
data you should consult the PostgreSQL source, in particular
the <b>*send</b> and <b>*recv</b> functions for each
column's data type (typically these functions are found in
the src/backend/utils/adt/ directory of the source
distribution).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If OIDs
are included in the file, the OID field immediately follows
the field&minus;count word. It is a normal field except that
it's not included in the field&minus;count. In particular it
has a length word &mdash; this will allow handling of
4&minus;byte vs. 8&minus;byte OIDs without too much pain,
and will allow OIDs to be shown as null if that ever proves
desirable.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>File
Trailer</big></b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>The file trailer consists
of a 16&minus;bit integer word containing &minus;1. This is
easily distinguished from a tuple's field&minus;count
word.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>A reader
should report an error if a field&minus;count word is
neither &minus;1 nor the expected number of columns. This
provides an extra check against somehow getting out of sync
with the data.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>COPY
country TO STDOUT (DELIMITER '|');</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>To copy
data from a file into the country table:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>COPY
country FROM '/usr1/proj/bray/sql/country_data';</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>To copy
into a file just the countries whose names start with
'A':</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>COPY

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
following is the same data, output in binary format. The
data is shown after filtering through the Unix utility <b>od

type integer. All the rows have a null value in the third
column.</big></p>
