<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gpm &minus; a
cut and paste utility and mouse server for virtual
consoles</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpm</b> [
<i>options</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This package
tries to be a useful mouse server for applications running
on the Linux console. It is based on the
&quot;selection&quot; package, and some of its code comes
from selection itself. This package is intended as a
replacement for &quot;selection&quot; as a cut-and-paste
mechanism; it also provides additional facilities. The
&quot;selection&quot; package offered the first
cut-and-paste implementation for Linux using two mouse
buttons, and the cut buffer is still called &quot;selection
buffer&quot; or just &quot;selection&quot; throughout this
document. The information below is extracted from the
texinfo file, which is the preferred source of
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The gpm
executable is meant to act like a daemon (thus, gpmd would
be a better name for it). This section is meant to describe
the command-line options for gpm, while its internals are
outlined in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Due to
restrictions in the ioctl(TIOCLINUX) system call, gpm must
be run by the superuser. The restrictions have been added in
the last 1.1 kernels to fix a security hole related to
selection and screen dumping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The server can
be configured to match the user&rsquo;s taste, and any
application using the mouse will inherit the server&rsquo;s
attitude. From release 1.02 up to 1.19.2 is was possible for
any user logged on the system console to change the mouse
feeling using the &minus;q option. This is no longer
possible for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 0.97 the
server program puts itself in the background. To kill gpm
you can just reinvoke it with the &minus;k cmdline switch,
although killall gpm can be a better choice.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL COMMANDS
<a name="SPECIAL COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 1.10
adds the capability to execute special commands on certain
circumstances. Special commands default to rebooting and
halting the system, but the user can specify his/her
personal choice. The capability to invoke commands using the
mouse is a handy one for programmers, because it allows to
issue a clean shutdown when the keyboard is locked and no
network is available to restore the system to a sane
state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special
commands are toggled by triple-clicking the left and right
button -- an unlikely event during normal mouse usage. The
easiest way to triple-click is pressing one of the buttons
and triple-click the other one. When special processing is
toggled, a message appears on the console (and the speaker
beeps twice, if you have a speaker); if the user releases
all the buttons and presses one of them again within three
seconds, then the special command corresponding to the
button is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
special commands are: <br>
left button</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reboot the system by signalling
the init process</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">middle button (if any)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute /sbin/shutdown &minus;h
now</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">right button</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute /sbin/shutdown &minus;r
now</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;S
command line switch enables special command processing and
allows to change the three special commands. To accept the
default commands use &minus;S &quot;&quot; (i.e., specify an
empty argument). To specify your own commands, use a
colon-separated list to specify commands associated to the
left, middle and right button. If any of the commands is
empty, it is interpreted as &lsquo;send a signal to the init
process&rsquo;. This particular operation is supported, in
addition to executing external commands, because sometimes
bad bugs put the system to the impossibility to fork; in
these rare case the programmer should be able to shutdown
the system anyways, and killing init from a running process
is the only way to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
&minus;S &quot;:telinit 1:/sbin/halt&quot;, associates
killing init to the left button, going single user to the
middle one, and halting the system to the right button.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
administrators should obviously be careful about special
commands, as gpm runs with superuser permissions. Special
commands are best suited for computers whose mouse can be
physically accessed only by trusted people.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
<a name="COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Available
command line options are the following: <br>
&minus;a <b>accel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the acceleration value used
when a single motion event is longer than <b>delta</b> (see
&minus;d<b>).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A[limit]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Start up with selection pasting
disabled. This is intended as a security measure; a
plausible attack on a system seems to be to stuff a nasty
shell command into the selection buffer (rm &minus;rf /)
including the terminating line break, then all the victim
has to do is click the middle mouse button .. As of version
1.17.2, this has developed into a more general aging
mechanism; the gpm daemon can disable (age) selection
pasting automatically after a period of inactivity. To
enable this mode just give the optional <b>limit</b>
parameter (no space in between !) which is interpreted as
the time in seconds for which a selection is considered
valid and pastable. As of version 1.15.7, a trivial program
called disable-paste is provided. The following makes a good
addition to /etc/profile if you allow multiple users to work
on your console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">case $(
/usr/bin/tty ) in <br>
/dev/tty[0&minus;9]*) /usr/bin/disable-paste ;; <br>
esac <br>
&minus;b <b>baud</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the baud rate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;B <b>sequence</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the button sequence. 123 is
the normal sequence, 321 can be used by left-handed people,
and 132 can be useful with two-button mice (especially
within Emacs). All the button permutations are
allowable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;d <b>delta</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the delta value. When a
single motion event is longer than <b>delta</b>,
<b>accel</b> is used as a multiplying factor. (Must be 2 or
above)</p>

<td width="78%">


<p>Do not automatically enter background operation when
started, and log messages to the standard error stream, not
the syslog mechanism. This is useful for debugging; in
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;g <b>number</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With glidepoint devices,
emulate the specified button with tapping. <b>number</b>
must be 1<b>, 2</b>, or 3<b>, and refers to the button
number before the &minus;B button remapping is performed.
This option applies to the mman and ps2 decoding. No button
is emulated by default because the ps2 tapping is
incompatible with some normal ps2 mice</b></p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;i <b>interval</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set <b>interval</b> to be used
as an upper time limit for multiple clicks. If the interval
between button-up and button-down events is less than
<b>limit</b>, the press is considered a double or triple
click. Time is in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Kill a running gpm. This can be used by busmouse users
to kill gpm before running X (unless they use &minus;R or
the single-open limitation is removed from the kernel).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;l <b>charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Choose the inword() look up
table. The <b>charset</b> argument is a list of characters.
&minus; <b>is used to specify a range and \ is used to
escape the next character or to provide octal codes. Only
visible character can appear in charset because control
characters can&rsquo;t appear in text-mode video memory,
whence selection is cut.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m filename</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Choose the mouse file to open.
Must be before &minus;t and &minus;o.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p>Enable multiple mode. The daemon will read two different
mouse devices. Any subsequent option will refer to the
second device, while any preceding option will be used for
the first device. This option automatically forces the
repeater (&minus;R) option on.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;o
<b>list-of-extra-options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The option works similary to
the &lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;o&rsquo;&rsquo; option of mount; it
is used to specify a list of &lsquo;&lsquo;extra
options&rsquo;&rsquo; that are specific to each mouse type.
The list is comma-separated. The options dtr, rts or both
are used by the serial initialization to toggle the modem
lines like, compatibly with earlier gpm versions; note
however that using &minus;o dtr associated with
non-plain-serial mouse types may now generate an error. And
by the way, use &minus;o after &minus;m and after
&minus;t.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<p>&minus;p</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Forces the pointer to be visible while selecting. This
is the behaviour of selection-1.7, but it is sometimes
confusing. The default is not to show the pointer, which can
be confusing as well.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;r <b>number</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the responsiveness. A
higher responsiveness is used for a faster cursor
motion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;R[<b>name</b>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Causes gpm to act as a
repeater: any mouse data received while in graphic mode will
be produced on the fifo /dev/gpmdata in protocol
<b>name</b>, given as an optional argument (no space in
between !). In principle, you can use the same names as for
the &minus;t option, although repeating into some protocols
may not be implemented for a while. In addition, you can
specify raw <b>as the name, to repeat the mouse data byte by
byte, without any protocol translation. If name is omitted,
it defaults to msc. Using gpm in repeater mode, you can
configure the X server to use its fifo as a mouse device.
This option is useful for bus-mouse owners to override the
single-open limitation. It is also an easy way to manage
those stupid dual-mode mice which force you to keep the
middle button down while changing video mode. The option is
forced on by the &minus;M option.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s number</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the sample rate for the
mouse device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;S <b>commands</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable special-command
processing, and optionally specify custom commands as a
colon-separated list. See above for a detailed description
of special commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;t <b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the mouse type. Use
&minus;t help to get a list of allowable types. Since
version 1.18.1, the list also shows which protocols are
available as repeaters (see &minus;R above), by marking them
with an asterisk (&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use &minus;t
after you selected the mouse device with &minus;m.</p>

any, will be taken as it was the right one.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>

<p>&minus;3</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>

<p>Force three buttons. By default the mouse is considered
to be a 2-buttons one, until the middle button is pressed.
If three buttons are there, the right one is used to extend
the selection, and the middle one is used to paste it.
Beware: if you use the &minus;3 option with a 2-buttons
mouse, you won&rsquo;t be able to paste the selection.</p></td></tr>

<h2>OPERATION
<a name="OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To select text
press the left mouse button and drag the mouse. To paste
text in the same or another console, press the middle
button. The right button is used to extend the selection,
like in &lsquo;xterm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two-button mice
use the right button to paste text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Double and
triple clicks select whole word and whole lines. Use of the
&lsquo;&minus;p&rsquo; option is recommended for best visual
feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a trailing
space after the contents of a line is highlighted, and if
there is no other text on the remainder of the line, the
rest of the line will be selected automatically. If a number
of lines are selected, highlighted trailing spaces on each
line will be removed from the selection buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any output on
the virtual console holding the selection will clear the
highlighted selection from the screen, to maintain integrity
of the display, although the contents of the paste buffer
will be unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The selection
mechanism is disabled if the controlling virtual console is
placed in graphics mode, for example when running X11, and
is re-enabled when text mode is resumed. (But see BUGS
section below.)</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The gpm server
may have problems interacting with X: if your mouse is a
single-open device (i.e. a bus mouse), you should kill gpm
before starting X, or use the &minus;R option (see above).
To kill gpm just invoke gpm &minus;k. This problem
doesn&rsquo;t apply to serial mice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two instances
of gpm can&rsquo;t run on the same system. If you have two
mice use the &minus;M option (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the
current console is in graphic mode, gpm sleeps until text
mode is back (unless &minus;R is used). Thus, it won&rsquo;t
reply to clients. Anyways, it is unlikely that mouse-eager
clients will spur out in hidden consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The clients
shipped out with gpm are not updated, thus there are
potential security risks when using them.</p>
