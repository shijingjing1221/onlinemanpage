&minus; zsh calendar system</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shell is
supplied with a series of functions to replace and enhance
the traditional Unix <b>calendar</b> programme, which warns
the user of imminent or future events, details of which are
stored in a text file (typically <b>calendar</b> in the
user&rsquo;s home directory). The version provided here
includes a mechanism for alerting the user when an event is
due.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition a
function <b>age</b> is provided that can be used in a glob
qualifier; it allows files to be selected based on their
modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the <b>calendar</b> file and the dates used there in and in
the <b>age</b> function are described first, then the
functions that can be called to examine and modify the
<b>calendar</b> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
here depend on the availability of the <b>zsh/datetime</b>
module which is usually installed with the shell. The
library function <b>strptime()</b> must be available; it is
present on most recent operating systems.</p>

<h2>FILE AND DATE FORMATS
<a name="FILE AND DATE FORMATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Calendar
File Format</b> <br>
The calendar file is by default <b>~/calendar</b>. This can
be configured by the <b>calendar&minus;file</b> style, see
the section STYLES below. The basic format consists of a
series of separate lines, with no indentation, each
including a date and time specification followed by a
description of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
enhancements to this format are supported, based on the
syntax of Emacs calendar mode. An indented line indicates a
continuation line that continues the description of the
event from the preceding line (note the date may not be
continued in this way). An initial ampersand (<b>&amp;</b>)
is ignored for compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An indented
line on which the first non&minus;whitespace character is
<b>#</b> is not displayed with the calendar entry, but is
still scanned for information. This can be used to hide
information useful to the calendar system but not to the
user, such as the unique identifier used by
<b>calendar_add</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Emacs
extension that a date with no description may refer to a
number of succeeding events at different times is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless the
<b>done&minus;file</b> style has been altered, any events
which have been processed are appended to the file with the
same name as the calendar file with the suffix <b>.done</b>,
hence <b>~/calendar.done</b> by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example is
shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Date
Format</b> <br>
The format of the date and time is designed to allow
flexibility without admitting ambiguity. (The words
&lsquo;date&rsquo; and &lsquo;time&rsquo; are both used in
the documentation below; except where specifically noted
this implies a string that may include both a date and a
time specification.) Note that there is no localization
support; month and day names must be in English and
separator characters are fixed. Matching is case
insensitive, and only the first three letters of the names
are significant, although as a special case a form beginning
&quot;month&quot; does not match &quot;Monday&quot;.
Furthermore, time zones are not handled; all times are
assumed to be local.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended that, rather than exploring the intricacies of
the system, users find a date format that is natural to them
and stick to it. This will avoid unexpected effects. Various
key facts should be noted.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>In particular, note the confusion between
<i>month</i><b>/</b><i>day</i><b>/</b><i>year</i> and
<i>day</i><b>/</b><i>month</i><b>/</b><i>year</i> when the
month is numeric; these formats should be avoided if at all
possible. Many alternatives are available.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The year must be given in full to avoid confusion, and
only years from 1900 to 2099 inclusive are matched.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
give some obvious examples; users finding here a format they
like and not subject to vagaries of style may skip the full
description. As dates and times are matched separately (even
though the time may be embedded in the date), any date
format may be mixed with any format for the time of day
provide the separators are clear (whitespace, colons,
commas).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>2007/04/03

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More detailed
rules follow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Times are
parsed and extracted before dates. They must use colons to
separate hours and minutes, though a dot is allowed before
seconds if they are present. This limits time formats to the
following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="55%">



<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i>[<b>:</b><i>SS</i>[<b>.</b><i>FFFFF</i>]]
[<b>am</b>|<b>pm</b>|<b>a.m.</b>|<b>p.m.</b>]</p> </td>
<td width="23%">
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="55%">



<p><i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i><b>.</b><i>SS</i>[<b>.</b><i>FFFFF</i>]
[<b>am</b>|<b>pm</b>|<b>a.m.</b>|<b>p.m.</b>]</p> </td>
<td width="23%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, square
brackets indicate optional elements, possibly with
alternatives. Fractions of a second are recognised but
ignored. For absolute times (the normal format require by
the <b>calendar</b> file and the <b>age</b> function) a date
is mandatory but a time of day is not; the time returned is
at the start of the date. One variation is allowed: if
<b>a.m.</b> or <b>p.m.</b> or one of their variants is
present, an hour without a minute is allowed, e.g. <b>3
p.m.</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Time zones are
not handled, though if one is matched following a time
specification it will be removed to allow a surrounding date
to be parsed. This only happens if the format of the
timezone is not too unusual. The following are examples of
forms that are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>+0100 <br>
GMT <br>
GMT&minus;7 <br>
CET+1CDT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any part of the
timezone that is not numeric must have exactly three capital
letters in the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dates suffer
from the ambiguity between
<i>DD</i><b>/</b><i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>YYYY</i> and
<i>MM</i><b>/</b><i>DD</i><b>/</b><i>YYYY</i>. It is
recommended this form is avoided with purely numeric dates,
but use of ordinals, eg. <b>3rd/04/2007</b>, will resolve
the ambiguity as the ordinal is always parsed as the day of
the month. Years must be four digits (and the first two must
be <b>19</b> or <b>20</b>); <b>03/04/08</b> is not
recognised. Other numbers may have leading zeroes, but they
are not required. The following are handled:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here,
<i>MNM</i> is at least the first three letters of a month
name, matched case&minus;insensitively. The remainder of the
month name may appear but its contents are irrelevant, so
janissary, febrile, martial, apricot, maybe, junta, etc. are
happily handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where the year
is shown as optional, the current year is assumed. There are
only two such cases, the form <b>Jun 20</b> or <b>14
September</b> (the only two commonly occurring forms, apart
from a &quot;the&quot; in some forms of English, which
isn&rsquo;t currently supported). Such dates will of course
become ambiguous in the future, so should ideally be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Times may
follow dates with a colon, e.g. <b>1965/07/12:09:45</b>;
this is in order to provide a format with no whitespace. A
comma and whitespace are allowed, e.g. <b>1965/07/12,
09:45</b>. Currently the order of these separators is not
checked, so illogical formats such as <b>1965/07/12, :
,09:45</b> will also be matched. For simplicity such
variations are not shown in the list above. Otherwise, a
time is only recognised as being associated with a date if
there is only whitespace in between, or if the time was
embedded in the date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Days of the
week are not normally scanned, but will be ignored if they
occur at the start of the date pattern only. However, in
contexts where it is useful to specify dates relative to
today, days of the week with no other date specification may
be given. The day is assumed to be either today or within
the past week. Likewise, the words <b>yesterday</b>,
<b>today</b> and <b>tomorrow</b> are handled. All matches
are case&minus;insensitive. Hence if today is Monday, then
<b>Sunday</b> is equivalent to <b>yesterday</b>,
<b>Monday</b> is equivalent to <b>today</b>, but
<b>Tuesday</b> gives a date six days ago. This is not
generally useful within the calendar file. Dates in this
format may be combined with a time specification; for
example <b>Tomorrow, 8 p.m.</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the standard date format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Fri Aug 18
17:00:48 BST 2006</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is handled by
matching <i>HH</i><b>:</b><i>MM</i><b>:</b><i>SS</i> and
removing it together with the matched (but unused) time
zone. This leaves the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Fri Aug 18
2006</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Fri</b> is
ignored and the rest is matched according to the standard
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Relative
Time Format</b> <br>
In certain places relative times are handled. Here, a date
is not allowed; instead a combination of various supported
periods are allowed, together with an optional time. The
periods must be in order from most to least significant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases,
a more accurate calculation is possible when there is an
anchor date: offsets of months or years pick the correct
day, rather than being rounded, and it is possible to pick a
particular day in a month as &lsquo;(1st Friday)&rsquo;,
etc., as described in more detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anchors are
available in the following cases. If one or two times are
passed to the function <b>calendar</b>, the start time acts
an anchor for the end time when the end time is relative
(even if the start time is implicit). When examining
calendar files, the scheduled event being examined anchors
the warning time when it is given explicitly by means of the
<b>WARN</b> keyword; likewise, the scheduled event anchors a
repetition period when given by the <b>RPT</b> keyword, so
that specifications such as <b>RPT 2 months, 3rd
Thursday</b> are handled properly. Finally, the
<b>&minus;R</b> argument to <b>calendar_scandate</b>
directly provides an anchor for relative calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The periods
handled, with possible abbreviations are:</p>

the numbers are optional, but are required between items,
although a comma may be used (with or without spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The forms
<b>yearly</b> to <b>hourly</b> allow the number to be
omitted; it is assumed to be 1. For example, <b>1 d</b> and
<b>daily</b> are equivalent. Note that using those forms
with plurals is confusing; <b>2 yearly</b> is the same as
<b>2 years</b>, <i>not</i> twice yearly, so it is
recommended they only be used without numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an anchor
time is present, there is an extension to handle regular
events in the form of the <i>n</i>th <i>some</i>day of the
month. Such a specification must occur immediately after any
year and month specification, but before any time of day,
and must be in the form <i>n</i><b>(th|st|rd)</b>
<i>day</i>, for example <b>1st Tuesday</b> or <b>3rd
Monday</b>. As in other places, days are matched case
insensitively, must be in English, and only the first three
letters are significant except that a form beginning
&lsquo;month&rsquo; does not match &lsquo;Monday&rsquo;. No
attempt is made to sanitize the resulting date; attempts to
squeeze too many occurrences into a month will push the day
into the next month (but in the obvious fashion, retaining
the correct day of the week).</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">The timed event
usually runs the programme <b>calendar_show</b> to show the
event, as described in the section UTILITY FUNCTIONS
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">By default, a
warning of the event is shown five minutes before it is due.
The warning period can be configured by the style
<b>warn&minus;time</b> or for a single calendar entry by
including <b>WARN</b> <i>reltime</i> in the first line of
the entry, where <i>reltime</i> is one of the usual relative
time formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">A repeated
event may be indicated by including <b>RPT</b>
<i>reldate</i> in the first line of the entry. After the
scheduled event has been displayed it will be
re&minus;entered into the calendar file at a time
<i>reldate</i> after the existing event. Note that this is
currently the only use made of the repeat count, so that it
is not possible to query the schedule for a recurrence of an
event in the calendar until the previous event has
passed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>RPT</b>
is used, it is also possible to specify that certain
recurrences of an event are rescheduled or cancelled. This
is done with the <b>OCCURRENCE</b> keyword, followed by
whitespace and the date and time of the occurrence in the
regular sequence, followed by whitespace and either the date
and time of the rescheduled event or the exact string
<b>CANCELLED</b>. In this case the date and time must be in
exactly the &quot;date with local time&quot; format used by
the <b>text/calendar</b> MIME type (RFC 2445),
<i>&lt;YYYY&gt;&lt;MM&gt;&lt;DD&gt;</i><b>T</b><i>&lt;hh&gt;&lt;mm&gt;&lt;ss&gt;</i>
(note the presence of the literal character <b>T</b>). The
first word (the regular recurrence) may be something other
than a proper date/time to indicate that the event is
additional to the normal sequence; a convention that retains
the formatting appearance is <b>XXXXXXXXTXXXXXX</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, it
is useful to record the next regular recurrence (as then the
displayed date may be for a rescheduled event so cannot be
used for calculating the regular sequence). This is
specified by <b>RECURRENCE</b> and a time or date in the
same format. <b>calendar_add</b> adds such an indication
when it encounters a recurring event that does not include
one, based on the headline date/time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>calendar_add</b> is used to update occurrences the
<b>UID</b> keyword described there should be present in both
the existing entry and the added occurrence in order to
identify recurring event sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">The event that
occurs at 11:00 on 13th May 2010 is rescheduled an hour
later. The event that occurs a week later is cancelled. The
occurrences are given on a continuation line starting with a
<b>#</b> character so will not usually be displayed as part
of the event. As elsewhere, no account of time zones is
taken with the times. After the next event occurs the
headline date/time will be &lsquo;<b>Thu May 13, 2010
12:00</b>&rsquo; while the <b>RECURRENCE</b> date/time will
be &lsquo;<b>20100513T110000</b>&rsquo; (note that cancelled
and moved events are not taken account of in the
<b>RECURRENCE</b>, which records what the next regular
recurrence is, but they are accounted for in the headline
date/time).</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">It is safe to
run <b>calendar &minus;s</b> to reschedule an existing event
(if the calendar file has changed, for example), and also to

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>calendar_add</b> [
<b>&minus;BL</b> ] <i>event ...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adds a single event to the
calendar in the appropriate location. The event can contain
multiple lines, as described in the section Calendar File
Format above. Using this function ensures that the calendar
file is sorted in date and time order. It also makes special
arrangements for locking the file while it is altered. The
old calendar is left in a file with the suffix
<b>.old</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option
<b>&minus;B</b> indicates that backing up the calendar file
will be handled by the caller and should not be performed by
<b>calendar_add</b>. The option <b>&minus;L</b> indicates
that <b>calendar_add</b> does not need to lock the calendar
file as it is already locked. These options will not usually
be needed by users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the style
<b>reformat&minus;date</b> is true, the date and time of the
new entry will be rewritten into the standard date format:
see the descriptions of this style and the style
<b>date&minus;format</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The function
can use a unique identifier stored with each event to ensure
that updates to existing events are treated correctly. The
entry should contain the word <b>UID</b>, followed by
whitespace, followed by a word consisting entirely of
hexadecimal digits of arbitrary length (all digits are
significant, including leading zeroes). As the UID is not
directly useful to the user, it is convenient to hide it on
an indented continuation line starting with a <b>#</b>, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Aug 31, 2007
09:30 Celebrate the end of the holidays <br>
# UID 045B78A0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The second line
will not be shown by the <b>calendar</b> function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify the <b>RPT</b> keyword followed by
<b>CANCELLED</b> instead of a relative time. This causes any
matched event or series of events to be cancelled (the
original event does not have to be marked as recurring in
order to be cancelled by this method). A <b>UID</b> is
required in order to match an existing event in the
calendar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>calendar_add</b>
will attempt to manage recurrences and occurrences of
repeating events as described for event scheduling by
<b>calendar &minus;s</b> above. To reschedule or cancel a
single event <b>calendar_add</b> should be called with an
entry that includes the correct <b>UID</b> but does
<i>not</i> include the <b>RPT</b> keyword as this is taken
to mean the entry applies to a series of repeating events
and hence replaces all existing information. Each
rescheduled or cancelled occurrence must have an
<b>OCCURRENCE</b> keyword in the entry passed to
<b>calendar_add</b> which will be merged into the calendar
file. Any existing reference to the occurrence is replaced.
An occurrence that does not refer to a valid existing event
is added as a one&minus;off occurrence to the same calendar
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>calendar_edit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This calls the user&rsquo;s
editor to edit the calendar file. If there are arguments,
they are taken as the editor to use (the file name is
appended to the commands); otherwise, the editor is given by
the variable <b>VISUAL</b>, if set, else the variable
<b>EDITOR</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the calendar
scheduler was running, then after editing the file
<b>calendar &minus;s</b> is called to update it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This function
locks out the calendar system during the edit. Hence it
should be used to edit the calendar file if there is any
possibility of a calendar event occurring meanwhile. Note
this can lead to another shell with calendar functions
enabled hanging waiting for a lock, so it is necessary to
quit the editor as soon as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>calendar_parse</b>
<i>calendar&minus;entry</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the internal function
that analyses the parts of a calendar entry, which is passed
as the only argument. The function returns status 1 if the
argument could not be parsed as a calendar entry and status
2 if the wrong number of arguments were passed; it also sets
the parameter <b>reply</b> to an empty associative array.
Otherwise, it returns status 0 and sets elements of the

far and a leading <b>+</b> is optional in that case. This
allows one to use the system as a date calculator. For
example, <b>calendar_showdate &rsquo;+1 month, 1st

in the argument. To prevent problems with network file
locking this is done in an ad hoc fashion by attempting to
create a symbolic link to the file with the name
<i>file</i><b>.lockfile</b>. No other system level functions
are used for locking, i.e. the file can be accessed and
modified by any utility that does not use this mechanism. In
particular, the user is not prevented from editing the
calendar file at the same time unless <b>calendar_edit</b>
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Three attempts
are made to lock the file before giving up. If the module
<b>zsh/zselect</b> is available, the times of the attempts
are jittered so that multiple instances of the calling
function are unlikely to retry at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The files
locked are appended to the array <b>lockfiles</b>, which
should be local to the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If all files

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>calendar_read</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a backend used by
various other functions to parse the calendar file, which is
passed as the only argument. The array
<b>calendar_entries</b> is set to the list of events in the
file; no pruning is done except that ampersands are removed
from the start of the line. Each entry may contain multiple
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>calendar_scandate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a generic function to
parse dates and times that may be used separately from the
calendar system. The argument is a date or time
specification as described in the section FILE AND DATE
FORMATS above. The parameter <b>REPLY</b> is set to the
number of seconds since the epoch corresponding to that date
or time. By default, the date and time may occur anywhere
within the given argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The argument passed is to be
parsed as a relative time. The time is relative to
<i>anchor_time</i>, a time in seconds since the epoch, and
the returned value is the absolute time corresponding to
advancing <i>anchor_time</i> by the relative time given.
This allows lengths of months to be correctly taken into
account. If the final day does not exist in the given month,
the last day of the final month is given. For example, if
the anchor time is during 31st January 2007 and the relative
time is 1 month, the final time is the same time of day
during 28th February 2007.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The function used by default to
display events. It accepts a start time and end time for
events, both in epoch seconds, and an event description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The event is
always printed to standard output. If the command line
editor is active (which will usually be the case) the
command line will be redisplayed after the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
parameter <b>DISPLAY</b> is set and the start and end times
are the same (indicating a scheduled event), the function
uses the command <b>xmessage</b> to display a window with
the event details.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As the system
is based entirely on shell functions (with a little support
from the <b>zsh/datetime</b> module) the mechanisms used are
not as robust as those provided by a dedicated calendar
utility. Consequently the user should not rely on the shell
for vital alerts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
<b>calendar_delete</b> function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
localization support for dates and times, nor any support
for the use of time zones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Relative
periods of months and years do not take into account the
variable number of days.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>calendar_show</b> function is currently hardwired to use
<b>xmessage</b> for displaying alerts on X Window System
displays. This should be configurable and ideally integrate
better with the desktop.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>calendar_lockfiles</b>
hangs the shell while waiting for a lock on a file. If
called from a scheduled task, it should instead reschedule
the event that caused it.</p>
