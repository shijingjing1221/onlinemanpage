<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PPM - Netpbm
color image format</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PPM format
is a lowest common denominator color image file format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should be
noted that this format is egregiously inefficient. It is
highly redundant, while containing a lot of information that
the human eye can&rsquo;t even discern. Furthermore, the
format allows very little information about the image
besides basic color, which means you may have to couple a
file in this format with other independent information to
get any decent use out of it. However, it is very easy to
write and analyze programs to process this format, and that
is the point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should also
be noted that files often conform to this format in every
respect except the precise semantics of the sample values.
These files are useful because of the way PPM is used as an
intermediary format. They are informally called PPM files,
but to be absolutely precise, you should indicate the
variation from true PPM. For example, &rsquo;PPM using the
red, green, and blue colors that the scanner in question
uses.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name
&quot;PPM&quot; is an acronym derived from &quot;Portable
Pixel Map.&quot; Images in this format (or a precursor of
it) were once also called &quot;portable pixmaps.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format
definition is as follows. You can use the
<b>libnetpbm</b>(1) <br>
C subroutine library to read and interpret the format
conveniently and accurately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PPM file
consists of a sequence of one or more PPM images. There are
no data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between
images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each PPM image
consists of the following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A &rsquo;magic number&rsquo; for identifying the file
type. A ppm image&rsquo;s magic number is the two characters
&rsquo;P6&rsquo;.</p> </td></tr>

<p>A raster of Height rows, in order from top to bottom.
Each row consists of Width pixels, in order from left to
right. Each pixel is a triplet of red, green, and blue
samples, in that order. Each sample is represented in pure
binary by either 1 or 2 bytes. If the Maxval is less than
256, it is 1 byte. Otherwise, it is 2 bytes. The most
significant byte is first.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A row of an
image is horizontal. A column is vertical. The pixels in the
image are square and contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the raster,
the sample values are &rsquo;nonlinear.&rsquo; They are
proportional to the intensity of the ITU-R Recommendation
BT.709 red, green, and blue in the pixel, adjusted by the
BT.709 gamma transfer function. (That transfer function
specifies a gamma number of 2.2 and has a linear section for
small intensities). A value of Maxval for all three samples
represents CIE D65 white and the most intense color in the
color universe of which the image is part (the color
universe is all the colors in all images to which this image
might be compared).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">ITU-R
Recommendation BT.709 is a renaming of the former CCIR
Recommendation 709. When CCIR was absorbed into its parent
organization, the ITU, ca. 2000, the standard was renamed.
This document once referred to the standard as CIE Rec. 709,
but it isn&rsquo;t clear now that CIE ever sponsored such a
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
another popular color space is the newer sRGB. A common
variation on PPM is to substitute this color space for the
one specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
common variation on the PPM format is to have the sample
values be &rsquo;linear,&rsquo; i.e. as specified above
except without the gamma adjustment. <b>pnmgamma</b> takes
such a PPM variant as input and produces a true PPM as
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strings
starting with &rsquo;#&rsquo; may be comments, the same as
with <b>PBM</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can use <b>pamdepth</b> to convert between a the format with
1 byte per sample and the one with 2 bytes per sample.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
actually another version of the PPM format that is fairly
rare: &rsquo;plain&rsquo; PPM format. The format above,
which generally considered the normal one, is known as the
&rsquo;raw&rsquo; PPM format. See <b>pbm</b>(1) <br>
for some commentary on how plain and raw formats relate to
one another and how to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The difference
in the plain format is:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is exactly one image in a
file.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The magic number is P3 instead of P6.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Each sample in the raster is represented as an ASCII
decimal number (of arbitrary size).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Each sample in the raster has white space before and
after it. There must be at least one character of white
space between any two samples, but there is no maximum.
There is no particular separation of one pixel from another
-- just the required separation between the blue sample of
one pixel from the red sample of the next pixel.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>-</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>No line should be longer than 70 characters.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example of a small image in this format. <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
newline character at the end of each of these lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs that
read this format should be as lenient as possible, accepting
anything that looks remotely like a PPM image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All characters
referred to herein are encoded in ASCII.
&rsquo;newline&rsquo; refers the character known in ASCII as
Line Feed or LF. A &rsquo;white space&rsquo; character is
space, CR, LF, TAB, VT, or FF (I.e. what the ANSI standard C
isspace() function calls white space).</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before April
2000, a raw format PPM file could not have a maxval greater
than 255. Hence, it could not have more than one byte per
sample. Old programs may depend on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before July
2000, there could be at most one image in a PPM file. As a
result, most tools to process PPM files ignore (and
don&rsquo;t read) any data after the first image.</p>
