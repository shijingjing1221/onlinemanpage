iSNS configuration file</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/etc/isns/isnsadm.conf

/etc/isns/isnsdd.conf</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All Open-iSNS
utilities read their configuration from a file in
<b>/etc/isns</b>. There is a separate configuration file for
each application, <b>isnsd</b>, <b>isnsadm</b>, and
<b>isnsdd</b>. The syntax and the set of supported options
is identical, even though some options are specific to e.g.
the server. Unless indicated, options are applicable to all
utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An Open-iSNS
configuration file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per
line. All keywords are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>#</b>
character introduces a comment, which extends until the end
of the line. Empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are no
line continuations, and you cannot use quotes around
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some options
specify timeout values, which are given in units of seconds
by default. You can specify an explicit unit, however, such
as <b>d</b> (days), <b>h</b> (hours), <b>m</b> (minutes), or
<b>s</b> (seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Generic
Options <br>
HostName</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, Open-iSNS
applications will retrieve the machine&rsquo;s hostname
using the <b>gethostname</b>(3) system call, and use a DNS
lookup to look up the canonical name. Using the
<b>HostName</b> option, you can overried this. This option
is rarely needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SourceName</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is mandatory for
all Open-iSNS applications. This should be a name which
identifies the client uniquely. There are two readings of
RFC 4171; one requires that this is an iSCSI qualified name
such as <b>iqn.2001-04.com.example.host</b>, whereas other
language in the RFC suggests that this is pretty much a
free-format string that just has to be unique (using e.g.
the client&rsquo;s fully qualified domain name).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When using DSA
authentication, Open-iSNS currently requires the source name
to match the key identifier (SPI) of the client&rsquo;s
public key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If left empty,
the source name is derived from the client&rsquo;s
hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ServerAddress</b>
(client):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options specifies the host
name or address of the iSNS server to talk to. It can
optionally be followed by a colon, and a port number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of a
hostname, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can be used. In order to
avoid ambiguities, literal IPv6 addresses must be surrounded
by square brackets, as in <b>[2001:4e5f::1]</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When specifying
a port number, you can use either the numeric port, or a
string name to be looked up in <b>/etc/services</b>. When
the port is omitted, it defaults to 3205, the IANA assigned
port number of iSNS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the special
string <b>SLP:</b> is used, the client will try to locate
the iSNS server through SLP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SLPRegister</b>
(server):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to 1, the iSNS daemon
will register itself will the SLP service. This allows
clients to contact the server without having to configure
its address statically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PIDFile</b> (server):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This specifies the name of the
server&rsquo;s PID file, which is <b>/var/run/isnsd.pid</b>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Database
Related Options</b> <br>
These options apply to the iSNS server only, and control
operation of the iSNS database. <b><br>
Database</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is used to specify
how the database is stored. Setting this to an absolute path
name will make <b>isnsd</b> keep its database in the
specified directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you leave
this empty, <b>isnsd</b> will keep its database in memory.
This is also the default setting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DefaultDiscoveryDomain</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">iSNS scopes visibility of other
nodes using so-called Discovery Domains. A storage node A
will only &quot;see&quot; storage node B, if both are
members of the same discovery domain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">So if a storage
node is registered which is not part of any discovery
domain, it will not see any other nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By setting
<b>DefaultDiscoveryDomain=1</b>, you can tell isnsd to
create a virtual &quot;default discovery domain&quot;, which
holds all nodes that are not part of any administratively
configured discovery domain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
there is no default discovery domain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RegistrationPeriod</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The iSNS server can purge
registered entities after a certain period of inactivity.
This is called the registration period. Clients who register
objects are supposed to refresh their registration within
this period.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 1 hour. Setting it to 0 disables expiry of entities
from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ESIRetries</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open-iSNS is able to monitor
the reachability of storage nodes and their portals by using
a protocol feature called ESI (Entity status inquiry).
Clients request ESI monitoring by registering an ESI port
along with each portal. The server will send ESI messages to
these portals at regular intervals. If the portal fails to
reply several times in a row, it is considered dead, and
will be removed from the database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ESIRetries</b>
specifies the maximum number of attempts the server will
make at contacting the portal before pronouncing it dead. If
set to 0, the server will disable ESI and reject any
registrations that specify an ESI port with an error code of
&quot;ESI not supported&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ESIMinInterval</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This timeout value specifies
the minimum ESI interval. If a client requests an ESI
interval less than this value, it is silently rounded
up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ESIMaxInterval</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This timeout value specifies
the maximum ESI interval. If a client requests an ESI
interval greater than this value, it is silently rounded
down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The maximum ESI
interval must not exceed half the value of the registration
period.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SCNRetries</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">iSNS clients can register to
receive State Change Notification (SCN) messages to learn
about changes in the iSNS database. This value specifies how
often the server will try to retransmit an SCN message until
giving up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SCNCallout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the path name of a
helper program that <b>isnsdd</b> will invoke whenever it
processes a state change notification from the server. The
helper program will be invoked with an argument indicating
the type of event, being one of <b>add</b>, <b>update</b>,
or <b>remove</b>. This is followed by a list of attributes
in <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> notation, using the names
and conventions described in <b>isnsadm</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Security
Related Options</b> <br>
The iSNS standard defines an authentication method based on
the DSA algorithm. Participants in a message exchange
authenticate messages by adding an &quot;authentication
block&quot; containing a time stamp, a string identifying
the key used, and a digital signature of the message. The
same method is also used by SLP, the Service Location
Protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The string
contained in the authentication block is referred to as the
<i>Security Policy Index</i>(SPI). This string can be used
by the server to look up the client&rsquo;s public key by
whatever mechanism; so the string could be used as the name
of a public key file in a directory, or to retrieve an X509
certificate from LDAP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the
perspective of Open-iSNS client applications, there are only
two keys: the client&rsquo;s own (private) key, used to sign
the messages it sends to the server, and the server&rsquo;s
public key, used to verify the signatures of incoming server
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The iSNS server
needs, in addition to its own private key, access to all
public keys of clients that will communicate to it. The
latter are kept in what is called a key store. Key stores
and their operation will be discussed in section <b>Key
Stores and Policy</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
configuration options control authentication: <b><br>
Security</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This enables or disables DSA
authentication. When set to 1, the client will sign all
messages, and expect all server messages to be signed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When enabling
security in the server, incoming messages are checked for
the presence of an auth block. If none is present, or if the
server cannot find a public key corresponding to the SPI,
the message is treated as originating from an anonymous
source. If the SPI is known but the signature is incorrect,
the message is dropped silently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Messages from
an anonymous source will be assigned a very restrictive
policy that allows database queries only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Setting this
option to 0 will turn off authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is -1, which tells iSNS to use authentication if the
required keys are installed, and use unauthenticated iSNS
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AuthName</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the string that will be
used as the SPI in all outgoing messages that have an auth
block. It defaults to the host name (please refer to option
<b>HostName</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AuthKeyFile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the path name of a file
containing a PEM encoded DSA key. This key is used to sign
outgoing messages. The default is
<b>/etc/isns/auth_key</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ServerKeyFile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is used by client
applications only, and specifies the path name of a file
containing a PEM encoded DSA key. This key is used to
authenticate the server&rsquo;s replies. The default is
<b>/etc/isns/server_key.pub</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>KeyStore</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This server-side option
specifies the key store to use, described in the next
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
two options control how iSNS will verify the time stamp
contained in the authentication block, which is supposed to
prevent replay attacks. <b><br>
Auth.ReplayWindow</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In order to compensate for
clock drift between two hosts exchanging iSNS messages,
Open-iSNS will apply a little fuzz when comparing the time
stamp contained in the message to the local system time. If
the difference between time stamp and local system time is
less than the number of seconds given by this option, the
message is acceptable. Otherwise, it is rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is <b>5m</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Auth.TimestampJitter</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When verifying incoming
messages, Open-iSNS checks that the time stamps sent by the
peer are increasing monotonically. In order to compensate
for the reordering of messages by the network (eg when using
UDP as transport), a certain time stamp jitter is accepted.
If the time stamp of an incoming messages is no earlier than
<b>TimestampJitter</b> seconds before the last time stamp
received, then the message is acceptable. Otherwise, it is
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is <b>1s</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Key Stores
and Policy</b> <br>
The current implementation supports two types of key
stores.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simple key
store uses a flat directory to store public keys, each key
in a file of its own. The file is expected to hold the
client&rsquo;s PEM-encoded public key, and it must use the
client&rsquo;s SPI as the name. This type of key store is
not really recommended, as it does not store any policy
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A simple key
store can be configured by setting the <b>KeyStore</b>
option to the path name of the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The recommended
approach is to use the database as key store. This uses
vendor-specific policy objects to tie SPI string, public
key, entity name, source name and other bits of policy
together, and store them in a persistent way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The database
key store is configured by setting the <b>KeyStore</b>
option to the reserved value <b>DB:</b>, which is also the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
Open-iSNS policy objects have the following attributes,
besides the SPI: <br>
Source:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the source node name
the client must use. It defaults to the SPI string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Functions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a bitmap detailing
which functions the client is permitted to invoke. The bit
names correspond to the shorthand names used in RFC 4711,
such as <b>DevAttrReg</b>, <b>DevAttrQry</b>, etc. The
default is to allow registration, query and deregistration,
as well as SCNRegister.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Entity name:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the entity name
assigned to the client. If set, a registration by the client
is not permitted to use a different entity name. If the
client sends a registration without Entity identifier, the
server will assign the entity name given in the policy. The
default is to not restrict the entity name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Object access:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a bitfield describing
access permissions for each object type. For each object
type, you can grant Read and/or Write permissions. Read
access applies to the Query and GetNext calls; all other
operations require write permission. The default grants read
and write access to objects of type Entity, Storage Node,
Portal and Portal Group; and read access to Discovery
Domains.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Node types:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This bitfield describes which
types of storage nodes a client is allowed to register; the
valid bit names are <b>target</b>, <b>initiator</b> and
<b>control</b>. The default is to restrict nodes to register
initiators only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Network
Related Options <br>
Network.MaxSockets</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the number of incoming
connections accepted, and defaults to 1024. This usually
applies to server side only, but is relevant if you create a
passive TCP socket for ESI or SCN.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Network.ConnectTimeout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a timeout value, which
specifies the time to wait for a TCP connection to be
established. It defaults to <b>60s</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Network.ReconnectTimeout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a connection attempt
failed, we wait for a short time before we try connecting
again. This is intended to take the pressure off overloaded
servers. The default value is <b>10s</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Network.CallTimeout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Total amount of time to wait
before timing out a call to the iSNS server. The default
value is <b>60s</b>.</p>
