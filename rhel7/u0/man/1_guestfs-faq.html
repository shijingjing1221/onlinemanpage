&minus; libguestfs Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</p>

<h2>ABOUT LIBGUESTFS
<a name="ABOUT LIBGUESTFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
libguestfs?</b> <br>
libguestfs is a way to create, access and modify disk
images. You can look inside disk images, modify the files
they contain, create them from scratch, resize them, and
much more. It&rsquo;s especially useful from scripts and
programs and from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libguestfs is a
C library (hence &quot;lib&minus;&quot;), and a set of tools
built on this library, and bindings for many common
programming languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information about what libguestfs can do read the
introduction on the home page (http://libguestfs.org).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What are the
virt tools?</b> <br>
Virt tools (website: http://virt&minus;tools.org) are a
whole set of virtualization management tools aimed at system
administrators. Some of them come from libguestfs, some from
libvirt and many others from other open source projects. So
virt tools is a superset of libguestfs. However libguestfs
comes with many important tools. See http://libguestfs.org
for a full list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Does
libguestfs need { libvirt / <small>KVM /</small> Red Hat /
Fedora }?</b> <br>
No!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libvirt is not
a requirement for libguestfs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libguestfs
works with any disk image, including ones created in VMware,
<small>KVM,</small> qemu, VirtualBox, Xen, and many other
hypervisors, and ones which you have created from
scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Red&nbsp;Hat
sponsors (ie. pays for) development of libguestfs and a huge
number of other open source projects. But you can run
libguestfs and the virt tools on many different Linux
distros and Mac <small>OS X.</small> We try our best to
support all Linux distros as first-class citizens. Some virt
tools have been ported to Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does
libguestfs compare to other tools?</b> <i><br>
vs. kpartx</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Libguestfs takes a different
approach from kpartx. kpartx needs root, and mounts
filesystems on the host kernel (which can be insecure
&minus; see &quot; <small>SECURITY&quot;</small> in
<i>guestfs</i>(3)). Libguestfs isolates your host kernel
from guests, is more flexible, scriptable, supports
<small>LVM,</small> doesn&rsquo;t require root, is isolated
from other processes, and cleans up after itself. Libguestfs
is more than just file access because you can use it to
create images from scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>vs. vdfuse</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">vdfuse is like kpartx but for
VirtualBox images. See the kpartx comparison above. You can
use libguestfs on the partition files exposed by vdfuse,
although it&rsquo;s not necessary since libguestfs can
access VirtualBox images directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>vs. qemu-nbd</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NBD</small> (Network
Block Device) is a protocol for exporting block devices over
the network. qemu-nbd is an <small>NBD</small> server which
can handle any disk format supported by qemu (eg. raw,
qcow2). You can use libguestfs and qemu-nbd together to
access block devices over the network, for example:
<tt>&quot;guestfish &minus;a nbd://remote&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>vs. mounting filesystems in
the host</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mounting guest filesystems in
the host is insecure and should be avoided completely for
untrusted guests. Use libguestfs to provide a layer of
protection against filesystem exploits. See also
<i>guestmount</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>vs. parted</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Libguestfs supports
<small>LVM.</small> Libguestfs uses parted and provides most
parted features through the libguestfs
<small>API.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
know what version I&rsquo;m using?</b> <br>
The simplest method is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> guestfish &minus;&minus;version</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libguestfs
development happens along an unstable branch and we
periodically create a stable branch which we backport stable
patches to. To find out more, read &quot; <small>LIBGUESTFS
VERSION NUMBERS&quot;</small> in <i>guestfs</i>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
get help? <br>
What mailing lists or chat rooms are available?</b> <br>
If you are a Red&nbsp;Hat customer using Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, please contact Red&nbsp;Hat&nbsp;Support:
http://redhat.com/support</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
mailing list, mainly for development, but users are also
welcome to ask questions about libguestfs and the virt
tools:
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
talk to us on <small>IRC</small> channel
<tt>&quot;#libguestfs&quot;</tt> on FreeNode. We&rsquo;re
not always around, so please stay in the channel after
asking your question and someone will get back to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For other virt
tools (not ones supplied with libguestfs) there is a general
virt tools mailing list:
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/virt&minus;tools&minus;list</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I

[This error message was changed in libguestfs 1.21.18 to
something more explanatory.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This error
indicates that qemu failed or the host kernel could not
boot. To get further information about the failure, you have
to run:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> libguestfs&minus;test&minus;tool</pre>

If you see this error on Debian/Ubuntu, you need to run the
following command as root:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> update&minus;guestfs&minus;appliance</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Non-ASCII
characters don&rsquo;t appear on <small>VFAT</small>
filesystems.</b> <br>
Typical symptoms of this problem:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>You get an error when you create a file where the
filename contains non-ASCII characters, particularly non
8&minus;bit characters from Asian languages (Chinese,
Japanese, etc). The filesystem is <small>VFAT.</small></p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>When you list a directory from a <small>VFAT</small>
filesystem, filenames appear as question marks.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
design flaw of the GNU/Linux system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>VFAT</small>
stores long filenames as <small>UTF&minus;16</small>
characters. When opening or returning filenames, the Linux
kernel has to translate these to some form of 8 bit string.
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> would be the obvious choice,
except for Linux users who persist in using
non&minus;UTF&minus;8 locales (the user&rsquo;s locale is
not known to the kernel because it&rsquo;s a function of
libc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore you
have to tell the kernel what translation you want done when
you mount the filesystem. The two methods are the
<tt>&quot;iocharset&quot;</tt> parameter (which is not
relevant to libguestfs) and the <tt>&quot;utf8&quot;</tt>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So to use a
<small>VFAT</small> filesystem you must add the
<tt>&quot;utf8&quot;</tt> flag when mounting. From
guestfish, use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &gt;&lt;fs&gt; mount&minus;options utf8 /dev/sda1 /</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or on the
guestfish command line:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> guestfish [...] &minus;m /dev/sda1:/:utf8</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or from the
<small>API:</small></p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> guestfs_mount_options (g, &quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;/dev/sda1&quot;, &quot;/&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The kernel will
then translate filenames to and from
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We considered
adding this mount option transparently, but unfortunately
there are several problems with doing that:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some Linux systems, the
<tt>&quot;utf8&quot;</tt> mount option doesn&rsquo;t work.
We don&rsquo;t precisely understand what systems or why, but
this was reliably reported by one user.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It would prevent you from using the
<tt>&quot;iocharset&quot;</tt> parameter because it is
incompatible with <tt>&quot;utf8&quot;</tt>. It is probably
not a good idea to use this parameter, but we don&rsquo;t
want to prevent it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Non-ASCII
characters appear as underscore (_) on
<small>ISO9660</small> filesystems.</b> <br>
The filesystem was not prepared correctly with mkisofs or
genisoimage. Make sure the filesystem was created using
Joliet and/or Rock Ridge extensions. libguestfs does not
require any special mount options to handle the
filesystem.</p>

Fedora &ge; 11</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> yum install '*guestf*'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For the latest
builds, see:
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8391</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>RHEL 5</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The version shipped in official
<small>RHEL 5</small> is very old and should not be used
except in conjunction with virt&minus;v2v. Use the
up-to-date libguestfs 1.20 package in <small>EPEL 5:</small>
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>RHEL 6</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">It is part of the default
install. On <small>RHEL 6</small> and 7 (only) you have to
install <tt>&quot;libguestfs&minus;winsupport&quot;</tt> to
get Windows guest support. <small><br>
RHEL 6.5</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">There is a preview repository
available for people who want to see what packages will be
in <small>RHEL 6.5.</small> Follow the instructions
here:</p>


<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2013&minus;May/msg00100.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>RHEL 7</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">It will be part of the default
install, and based on libguestfs&nbsp;1.22. You will need to
install <tt>&quot;libguestfs&minus;winsupport&quot;</tt>
separately to get Windows guest support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Debian and Ubuntu</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Debian Squeeze (6)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Hilko Bengen has built
libguestfs in squeeze backports:
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=guestfs&amp;searchon=names&amp;section=all&amp;suite=squeeze&minus;backports</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Debian Wheezy and later
(7+)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Hilko Bengen supports
libguestfs on Debian. Official Debian packages are
available:
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libguestfs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ubuntu</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">We don&rsquo;t have a full time
Ubuntu maintainer, and the packages supplied by Canonical
(which are outside our control) are sometimes broken.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Canonical
decided to change the permissions on the kernel so that
it&rsquo;s not readable except by root. This is completely
stupid, but they won&rsquo;t change it
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/759725).
So every user should do this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"> sudo chmod 0644 /boot/vmlinuz*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%;">Ubuntu 12.04</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">libguestfs in this version of
Ubuntu works, but you need to update febootstrap and seabios
to the latest versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">You need
febootstrap &ge; 3.14&minus;2 from:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/febootstrap</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">After
installing or updating febootstrap, rebuild the
appliance:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em"> sudo update&minus;guestfs&minus;appliance</pre>


<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">You need
seabios &ge; 0.6.2&minus;0ubuntu2.1 or &ge;
0.6.2&minus;0ubuntu3 from:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise&minus;updates/seabios or
http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/seabios</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Also you need
to do (see above):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em"> sudo chmod 0644 /boot/vmlinuz*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Gentoo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Libguestfs was added to Gentoo
in 2012&minus;07 by Andreis Vinogradovs (libguestfs) and
Maxim Koltsov (mainly hivex). Do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> emerge libguestfs</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">SuSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Libguestfs was added to SuSE in
2012 by Olaf Hering.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ArchLinux</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Libguestfs was added to the
<small>AUR</small> in 2010.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Other Linux distro</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Compile from source (next
section).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Other non-Linux distro</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You&rsquo;ll have to compile
from source, and port it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
compile and install libguestfs from source?</b> <br>
If your Linux distro has a working port of supermin (that
is, Fedora,
Red&nbsp;Hat&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;6.3,
Debian, Ubuntu and ArchLinux) then you should just be able
to compile from source in the usual way. Download the latest
tarball from http://libguestfs.org/download, unpack it, and
start by reading the <small>README</small> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> have supermin, you will need to use the
&quot;fixed appliance method&quot;. See:
http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/appliance/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patches to port
supermin to more Linux distros are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do I get
an error when I try to rebuild from the source RPMs supplied
by Red Hat / Fedora? <br>
Note:</b> This issue is fixed in Fedora&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;19
and <small>RHEL</small> &nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;6.5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of the
complexity of building the libguestfs appliance, the source
RPMs provided cannot be rebuilt directly using
<tt>&quot;rpmbuild&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;mock&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use Koji
(which is open source software and may be installed
locally), then the SRPMs can be rebuilt in Koji.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t have or want to use Koji, then you have to give
libguestfs access to the network so it can download the RPMs
for building the appliance. You also need to set an
<small>RPM</small> macro to tell libguestfs to use the
network. Put the following line into a file called
<tt>&quot;$HOME/.rpmmacros&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> %libguestfs_buildnet   1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using mock, do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> mock &minus;D '%libguestfs_buildnet 1' [etc]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
add support for sVirt? <br>
Note for Fedora/RHEL users:</b> This configuration is the
default starting with Fedora&nbsp;18 and
<small>RHEL&nbsp;7.</small> If you find any problems, please
let us know or file a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SVirt provides
a hardened appliance using SELinux, making it very hard for
a rogue disk image to &quot;escape&quot; from the
confinement of libguestfs and damage the host (it&rsquo;s
fair to say that even in standard libguestfs this would be
hard, but sVirt provides an extra layer of protection for
the host and more importantly protects virtual machines on
the same host from each other).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently to
enable sVirt you will need libvirt &ge; 0.10.2 (1.0 or later
preferred), libguestfs &ge; 1.20, and the SELinux policies
from recent Fedora. If you are not running Fedora&nbsp;18+,
you will need to make changes to your SELinux policy &minus;
contact us on the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you have
the requirements, do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> ./configure &minus;&minus;with&minus;default&minus;backend=libvirt       # libguestfs &gt;= 1.22
 ./configure &minus;&minus;with&minus;default&minus;attach&minus;method=libvirt # libguestfs &lt;= 1.20
 make</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set SELinux to
Enforcing mode, and sVirt should be used automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All, or almost
all, features of libguestfs should work under sVirt. There
is one known shortcoming: <i>virt&minus;rescue</i>(1) will
not use libvirt (hence sVirt), but falls back to direct
launch of qemu. So you won&rsquo;t currently get the benefit
of sVirt protection when using virt-rescue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can check
if sVirt is being used by enabling libvirtd logging (see
<tt>&quot;/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.log&quot;</tt>), killing and
restarting libvirtd, and checking the log files for
&quot;Setting&nbsp;SELinux&nbsp;context&nbsp;on&nbsp;...&quot;
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In theory sVirt
should support AppArmor, but we have not tried it. It will
almost certainly require patching libvirt and writing an
AppArmor policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Libguestfs
has a really long list of dependencies!</b> <br>
That&rsquo;s because it does a lot of things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libguestfs --
<i>as it is packaged for Fedora</i> -- satisfies the
following conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
drop any one of those conditions, then you can package
libguestfs differently and make it have fewer dependencies,
fewer features or a faster start up time: <br>
1. (full featured)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Take
<tt>&quot;appliance/packagelist.in&quot;</tt> in the source,
and comment out any features you don&rsquo;t actually care
about. For example if you never anticipate editing a Windows
guest, remove all the ntfs-related packages. You can get
away with fewer dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">2. (download size) / 3.

dependencies are needed, and <i>supermin&minus;helper</i>(1)
is not used.</p>

appliance once during package install. The Debian packaging
currently works like this, but requires network access

less likely to work correctly.</p>

running the tests in <tt>&quot;tests/qemu&quot;</tt> is
probably a good idea, since those are sanity tests. Also you

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b>
Most of the information in this section has moved:
<i>guestfs&minus;performance</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Upload or
write seem very slow.</b> <br>
In libguestfs &lt; 1.13.16, the mount command
(&quot;guestfs_mount&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3)) enabled
option <tt>&quot;&minus;o sync&quot;</tt> implicitly. This
causes very poor write performance, and was one of the main
gotchas for new libguestfs users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For libguestfs
&lt; 1.13.16, replace mount with
<tt>&quot;mount&minus;options&quot;</tt>, leaving the first
parameter as an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also do
this with more recent versions of libguestfs, but if you
know that you are using libguestfs &ge; 1.13.16 then
it&rsquo;s safe to use plain mount.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
underlying disk is not fully allocated (eg. sparse raw or
qcow2) then writes can be slow because the host operating
system has to do costly disk allocations while you are
writing. The solution is to use a fully allocated format
instead, ie. non-sparse raw, or qcow2 with the
<tt>&quot;preallocation=metadata&quot;</tt> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Libguestfs
uses too much disk space!</b> <br>
libguestfs caches a large-ish appliance in:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /var/tmp/.guestfs&minus;&lt;UID&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable <tt>&quot;TMPDIR&quot;</tt> is defined,
then <tt>&quot;$TMPDIR/.guestfs&minus;&lt;UID&gt;&quot;</tt>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is safe to
delete this directory when you are not using libguestfs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>virt-sparsify
seems to make the image grow to the full size of the virtual

If the input to <i>virt&minus;sparsify</i>(1) is raw, then
the output will be raw sparse. Make sure you are measuring
the output with a tool which understands sparseness such as
<tt>&quot;du &minus;sh&quot;</tt>. It can make a huge
difference:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> $ ls &minus;lh test1.img
 &minus;rw&minus;rw&minus;r&minus;&minus;. 1 rjones rjones 100M Aug  8 08:08 test1.img

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Compare the
apparent size <b>100M</b> vs the actual size
<b>3.6M</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all this
confuses you, use a non-sparse output format by specifying
the <i>&minus;&minus;convert</i> option, eg:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> virt&minus;sparsify &minus;&minus;convert qcow2 disk.raw disk.qcow2</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
doesn&rsquo;t virt-resize work on the disk image
in-place?</b> <br>
Resizing a disk image is very tricky -- especially making
sure that you don&rsquo;t lose data or break the bootloader.
The current method effectively creates a new disk image and
copies the data plus bootloader from the old one. If
something goes wrong, you can always go back to the
original.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we were to
make virt-resize work in-place then there would have to be
limitations: for example, you wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to
move existing partitions (because moving data across the
same disk is most likely to corrupt data in the event of a
power failure or crash), and <small>LVM</small> would be
very difficult to support (because of the almost arbitrary
mapping between <small>LV</small> content and underlying
disk blocks).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another method
we have considered is to place a snapshot over the original
disk image, so that the original data is untouched and only
differences are recorded in the snapshot. You can do this
today using <tt>&quot;qemu&minus;img create&quot;</tt> +
<tt>&quot;virt&minus;resize&quot;</tt>, but qemu currently
isn&rsquo;t smart enough to recognize when the same block is
written back to the snapshot as already exists in the
backing disk, so you will find that this doesn&rsquo;t save
you any space or time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In summary,
this is a hard problem, and what we have now mostly works so
we are reluctant to change it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
doesn&rsquo;t virt-sparsify work on the disk image
in-place?</b> <br>
Eventually we plan to make virt-sparsify work on disk images
in-place, instead of copying the disk image. However it
requires several changes to both the Linux kernel and qemu
which are slowly making their way upstream (thanks to the
tireless efforts of Paolo Bonzini). Then we will have to
modify virt-sparsify to support this. Finally there will be
some integration work required to make sure all the pieces
work together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even with this
implemented there may be some limitations: For example, it
requires completely different steps (and is probably harder)
to sparsify a disk image that is stored on a <small>SAN
LUN,</small> compared to one which is stored in a local raw
image file, so you can expect that different storage and
backing formats will become supported at different times.
Some backing filesystems / formats may never support
sparsification (eg. disk images stored on
<small>VFAT,</small> old-style non-thin LVs).</p>

<h2>DESIGN/INTERNALS OF LIBGUESTFS
<a name="DESIGN/INTERNALS OF LIBGUESTFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
don&rsquo;t you do everything through the <small>FUSE
/</small> filesystem interface?</b> <br>
We offer a command called <i>guestmount</i>(1) which lets
you mount guest filesystems on the host. This is implemented
as a <small>FUSE</small> module. Why don&rsquo;t we just
implement the whole of libguestfs using this mechanism,
instead of having the large and rather complicated
<small>API</small> ?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reasons are
twofold. Firstly, libguestfs offers <small>API</small> calls
for doing things like creating and deleting partitions and
logical volumes, which don&rsquo;t fit into a filesystem
model very easily. Or rather, you could fit them in: for
example, creating a partition could be mapped to
<tt>&quot;mkdir /fs/hda1&quot;</tt> but then you&rsquo;d
have to specify some method to choose the size of the
partition (maybe <tt>&quot;echo 100M &gt;
/fs/hda1/.size&quot;</tt>), and the partition type, start
and end sectors etc., but once you&rsquo;ve done that the
filesystem-based <small>API</small> starts to look more
complicated than the call-based <small>API</small> we
currently have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
reason is for efficiency. <small>FUSE</small> itself is
reasonably efficient, but it does make lots of small,
independent calls into the <small>FUSE</small> module. In
guestmount these have to be translated into messages to the
libguestfs appliance which has a big overhead (in time and
round trips). For example, reading a file in 64
<small>KB</small> chunks is inefficient because each chunk
would turn into a single round trip. In the libguestfs
<small>API</small> it is much more efficient to download an
entire file or directory through one of the streaming calls
like <tt>&quot;guestfs_download&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;guestfs_tar_out&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
don&rsquo;t you do everything through <small>GVFS</small>
?</b> <br>
The problems are similar to the problems with
<small>FUSE.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>GVFS</small>
is a better abstraction than <small>POSIX/FUSE.</small>
There is an <small>FTP</small> backend for
<small>GVFS,</small> which is encouraging because
<small>FTP</small> is conceptually similar to the libguestfs
<small>API.</small> However the <small>GVFS FTP</small>
backend makes multiple simultaneous connections in order to
keep interactivity, which we can&rsquo;t easily do with
libguestfs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why can I
write to the disk, even though I added it read-only? <br>
Why does &quot;&minus;&minus;ro&quot; appear to have no
effect?</b> <br>
When you add a disk read-only, libguestfs places a writable
overlay on top of the underlying disk. Writes go into this
overlay, and are discarded when the handle is closed (or
<tt>&quot;guestfish&quot;</tt> etc. exits).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
reasons for doing it this way: Firstly read-only disks
aren&rsquo;t possible in many cases (eg. <small>IDE</small>
simply doesn&rsquo;t support them, so you couldn&rsquo;t
have an IDE-emulated read-only disk, although this is not
common in real libguestfs installations).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Secondly and
more importantly, even if read-only disks were possible, you
wouldn&rsquo;t want them. Mounting any filesystem that has a
journal, even <tt>&quot;mount &minus;o ro&quot;</tt>, causes
writes to the filesystem because the journal has to be
replayed and metadata updated. If the disk was truly
read-only, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to mount a dirty
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make it
usable, we create the overlay as a place to temporarily
store these writes, and then we discard it afterwards. This
ensures that the underlying disk is always untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
there is a regression test for this when building libguestfs
(in <tt>&quot;tests/qemu&quot;</tt>). This is one reason why
it&rsquo;s important for packagers to run the test
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Does
&quot;&minus;&minus;ro&quot; make all disks read-only?</b>
<i><br>
No!</i> The <tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;ro&quot;</tt> option
only affects disks added on the command line, ie. using
<tt>&quot;&minus;a&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;&minus;d&quot;</tt> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In guestfish,
if you use the <tt>&quot;add&quot;</tt> command, then disk
is added read-write (unless you specify the
<tt>&quot;readonly:true&quot;</tt> flag explicitly with the
command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I use
&quot;guestfish &minus;&minus;ro&quot; as a way to backup my
virtual machines?</b> <br>
Usually this is <i>not</i> a good idea. The question is
answered in more detail in this mailing list posting:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010&minus;August/msg00024.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
next question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
can&rsquo;t I run fsck on a live filesystem using
&quot;guestfish &minus;&minus;ro&quot;?</b> <br>
This command will usually <i>not</i> work:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> guestfish &minus;&minus;ro &minus;a /dev/vg/my_root_fs run : fsck /dev/sda</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
this is that qemu creates a snapshot over the original
filesystem, but it doesn&rsquo;t create a strict
point-in-time snapshot. Blocks of data on the underlying
filesystem are read by qemu at different times as the fsck
operation progresses, with host writes in between. The
result is that fsck sees massive corruption (imaginary, not
real!) and fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What you have
to do is to create a point-in-time snapshot. If it&rsquo;s a
logical volume, use an <small>LVM2</small> snapshot. If the
filesystem is located inside something like a btrfs/ZFS
file, use a btrfs/ZFS snapshot, and then run the fsck on the
snapshot. In practice you don&rsquo;t need to use libguestfs
for this -- just run <tt>&quot;/sbin/fsck&quot;</tt>
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Creating
point-in-time snapshots of host devices and files is outside
the scope of libguestfs, although libguestfs can operate on
them once they are created.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What&rsquo;s
the difference between guestfish and virt-rescue?</b> <br>
A lot of people are confused by the two superficially
similar tools we provide:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> $ guestfish &minus;&minus;ro &minus;a guest.img
 &gt;&lt;fs&gt; run
 &gt;&lt;fs&gt; fsck /dev/sda1
 $ virt&minus;rescue &minus;&minus;ro guest.img
 &gt;&lt;rescue&gt; /sbin/fsck /dev/sda1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And the related
question which then arises is why you can&rsquo;t type in
full shell commands with all the &minus;&minus;options in
guestfish (but you can in <i>virt&minus;rescue</i>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>guestfish</i>(1)
is a program providing structured access to the
<i>guestfs</i>(3) <small>API.</small> It happens to be a
nice interactive shell too, but its primary purpose is
structured access from shell scripts. Think of it more like
a language binding, like Python and other bindings, but for
shell. The key differentiating factor of guestfish (and the
libguestfs <small>API</small> in general) is the ability to
automate changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>virt&minus;rescue</i>(1)
is a free-for-all freeform way to boot the libguestfs
appliance and make arbitrary changes to your
<small>VM.</small> It&rsquo;s not structured, you
can&rsquo;t automate it, but for making quick ad-hoc fixes
to your guests, it can be quite useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But, libguestfs
also has a &quot;backdoor&quot; into the appliance allowing
you to send arbitrary shell commands. It&rsquo;s not as
flexible as virt-rescue, because you can&rsquo;t interact
with the shell commands, but here it is anyway:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &gt;&lt;fs&gt; debug sh &quot;cmd arg1 arg2 ...&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
should <b>not</b> rely on this. It could be removed or
changed in future. If your program needs some operation,
please add it to the libguestfs <small>API</small>
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What&rsquo;s
the deal with &quot;guestfish &minus;i&quot;? <br>
Why does virt-cat only work on a real <small>VM</small>
image, but virt-df works on any disk image? <br>
What does &quot;no root device found in this operating
system image&quot; mean?</b> <br>
These questions are all related at a fundamental level which
may not be immediately obvious.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the
<i>guestfs</i>(3) <small>API</small> level, a &quot;disk
image&quot; is just a pile of partitions and
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast,
when the virtual machine boots, it mounts those filesystems
into a consistent hierarchy such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /          (/dev/sda2)
 |
 +&minus;&minus; /boot  (/dev/sda1)
 |
 +&minus;&minus; /home  (/dev/vg_external/Homes)
 |
 +&minus;&minus; /usr   (/dev/vg_os/lv_usr)
 |
 +&minus;&minus; /var   (/dev/vg_os/lv_var)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(or drive
letters on Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>API</small> first of all sees the disk image at the
&quot;pile of filesystems&quot; level. But it also has a way
to inspect the disk image to see if it contains an operating
system, and how the disks are mounted when the operating
system boots: &quot; <small>INSPECTION&quot;</small> in
<i>guestfs</i>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users expect
some tools (like <i>virt&minus;cat</i>(1)) to work with
<small>VM</small> paths:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> virt&minus;cat fedora.img /var/log/messages</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How does
virt-cat know that <tt>&quot;/var&quot;</tt> is a separate
partition? The trick is that virt-cat performs inspection on
the disk image, and uses that to translate the path
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some tools
(including <i>virt&minus;cat</i>(1),
<i>virt&minus;edit</i>(1), <i>virt&minus;ls</i>(1)) use
inspection to map <small>VM</small> paths. Other tools, such
as <i>virt&minus;df</i>(1) and
<i>virt&minus;filesystems</i>(1) operate entirely at the raw
&quot;big pile of filesystems&quot; level of the libguestfs
<small>API,</small> and don&rsquo;t use inspection.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>guestfish</i>(1)
is in an interesting middle ground. If you use the
<i>&minus;a</i> and <i>&minus;m</i> command line options,
then you have to tell guestfish exactly how to add disk
images and where to mount partitions. This is the raw
<small>API</small> level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
<i>&minus;i</i> option, libguestfs performs inspection and
mounts the filesystems for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The error
<tt>&quot;no root device found in this operating system
image&quot;</tt> is related to this. It means inspection was
unable to locate an operating system within the disk image
you gave it. You might see this from programs like virt-cat
if you try to run them on something which is just a disk
image, not a virtual machine disk image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What do
these &quot;debug*&quot; and &quot;internal&minus;*&quot;
functions do?</b> <br>
There are some functions which are used for debugging and
internal purposes which are <i>not</i> part of the stable
<small>API.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;debug*&quot;</tt> (or
<tt>&quot;guestfs_debug*&quot;</tt>) functions, primarily
&quot;guestfs_debug&quot; in <i>guestfs</i>(3) and a handful
of others, are used for debugging libguestfs. Although they
are not part of the stable <small>API</small> and thus may
change or be removed at any time, some programs may want to
call these while waiting for features to be added to
libguestfs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;internal&minus;*&quot;</tt> (or
<tt>&quot;guestfs_internal_*&quot;</tt>) functions are
purely to be used by libguestfs itself. There is no reason
for programs to call them, and programs should not try to
use them. Using them will often cause bad things to happen,
as well as not being part of the documented stable
<small>API.</small></p>

<h2>DEVELOPERS
<a name="DEVELOPERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where do I
send patches?</b> <br>
Please send patches to the libguestfs mailing list
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs. You
don&rsquo;t have to be subscribed, but there will be a delay
until your posting is manually approved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Please
don&rsquo;t use github pull requests &minus; they will be
ignored</b>. The reasons are (a) we want to discuss and
dissect patches on the mailing list, and (b) github pull
requests turn into merge commits but we prefer to have a
linear history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
propose a feature?</b> <br>
Large new features that you intend to contribute should be
discussed on the mailing list first
(https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs). This
avoids disappointment and wasted work if we don&rsquo;t
think the feature would fit into the libguestfs project.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
suggest a useful feature but don&rsquo;t want to write the
code, you can file a bug (see &quot; <small>GETTING HELP AND
REPORTING BUGS&quot;</small> ) with <tt>&quot;RFE:
&quot;</tt> at the beginning of the Summary line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Who can
commit to libguestfs git?</b> <br>
About 5 people have commit access to github. Patches should
be posted on the list first and ACKed. The policy for ACKing
and pushing patches is outlined here:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2012&minus;January/msg00023.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I fork
libguestfs?</b> <br>
Of course you can. Git makes it easy to fork libguestfs.
Github makes it even easier. It&rsquo;s nice if you tell us
on the mailing list about forks and the reasons for
them.</p>
