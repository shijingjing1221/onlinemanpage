<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sane&minus;apple
&minus; SANE backend for Apple flatbed scanners</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sane&minus;apple</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Apple
flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners are
supported from this backend:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">---------------
----- ------------------ ------ <br>
AppleScanner 4bit 16 Shades of Gray <br>
OneScanner 8bit 256 Shades of Gray <br>
ColorOneScanner 24bit RGB color 3-pass</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you own a
Apple scanner other than the ones listed above that works
with this backend, please let us know by sending the
scanner&rsquo;s model name, SCSI id, and firmware revision
to <i>sane&minus;devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</i>. See
http://www.sane&minus;project.org/mailing&minus;lists.html
for details on how to subscribe to sane&minus;devel.</p>

<h2>DEVICE NAMES
<a name="DEVICE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
expects device names of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>special</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>special</i> is either the path-name for the special
device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a
device name could be <i>/dev/sga</i> or <i>/dev/sge</i>, for
example. See sane&minus;scsi(5) for details.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>apple.conf</i> file is a list of options and device names
that correspond to Apple scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See
sane&minus;scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
device name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options come in
two flavors: global and positional ones. Global options
apply to all devices managed by the backend, whereas
positional options apply just to the most recently mentioned
device. Note that this means that the order in which the
options appear matters!</p>

<h2>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
<a name="SCSI ADAPTER TIPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI scanners
are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.
Unfortunately, that adapter is not worth much since it is
not interrupt driven. It is sometimes possible to get the
supplied card to work, but without an interrupt line,
scanning will put so much load on the system that it becomes
almost unusable for other tasks.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/etc/sane.d/apple.conf</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The backend configuration file
(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;apple.a</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The static library implementing
this backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;apple.so</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This environment variable is
list of directories where SANE looks for the configuration
file. Under UNIX directory names are separated by a colon
(&lsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2 by a semi-colon
(&lsquo;;&rsquo;). If SANE_CONFIG_DIR is not set, SANE
defaults to searching the current working directory
(&quot;.&quot;) and then /etc/sane.d. If the value of
$SANE_CONFIG_DIR ends with the separator character, the
default directories are searched after the directory list.
For example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in that order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_DEBUG_APPLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Controls the debug level. A
value of 255 prints all debug output. Smaller values reduce
verbosity. Requires a library compiled with debug
support.</p>

<h2>CURRENT STATUS
<a name="CURRENT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The apple
backend is now in version 0.3 (Tue Jul 21 1998). Since I
only have the AppleScanner and not the other models
(OneScanner, ColorOneScanner) I can only develop/test for
the AppleScanner effectively. However with this release I
almost completed the gui part of all scanners. Most of the
functionality is there. At least OneScanner should scan at
the AppleScanner&rsquo;s compatible modes (LineArt,
HalfTone, Gray16). My personal belief is that with a slight
touch of debugging the OneScanner could be actually usable.
The ColorOneScanner needs more work. AppleScanner is of
course almost fully supported.</p>

<h2>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
<a name="MISSING FUNCTIONALITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently all
three models lack upload/download support. <b><br>
AppleScanner</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cannot up/download a halftone
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>OneScanner</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cannot up/download halftone
patterns or calibration vectors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ColorOneScanner</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cannot up/download halftone
patterns, calibration vectors, custom Color Correction
Tables (CCT) and of course custom gamma tables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Park/UnPark (OneScanner,
ColorOneScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
functionalities are missing because I don&rsquo;t have the
hardware to experiment on. Another reason is my lack of
understanding as to how or if the SANE API provide means to
describe any array type besides gamma.</p>

<h2>UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
<a name="UNSUPPORTED FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
&quot;features&quot; will never be supported, at least while
I maintain the sane&minus;apple backend. <b><br>
NoHome (AppleScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The scanner lamp stays on and
the carriage assembly remains where it stops at the end of
the scan. After two minutes, if the scanner does not receive
another SCAN command, the lamp goes off and the carriage
returns to the home position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Compression
(AppleScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The Scanner can compress data
with CCITT Group III one dimensional algorithm (fax) and the
Skip White Line algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Multiple Windows
(AppleScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">AppleScanner may support
multiple windows. It would be a cool feature and a challenge
for me to code if it could intermix different options for
different windows (scan areas). This way it could scan a
document in LineArt mode but the figures in it in Gray and
at a different resolution. Unfortunately this is
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scan Direction
(OneScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It controls the scan direction.
(?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Status/Reset Button
(OneScanner)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls the status
of the button on the OneScanner model. You can also reset
the button status by software.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SANE backend
bugs are divided in two classes. We have <b>GUI</b> bugs and
<b>scanner specific</b> bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We know we have
a GUI bug when a parameter is not showing up when it should
(active) or vice versa. Finding out which parameters are
active across various Apple modes and models from the
documentation
<b>ftp://ftpdev.info.apple.com/devworld/Technical_Documentation/Peripherals_Documentation/</b>
is an interesting exercise. I may have missed some
dependencies. For example of the threshold parameter the
Apple Scanners Programming Guide says nothing. I had to
assume it is valid only in LineArt mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scanner
specific bugs are mostly due to mandatory round-offs in
order to scan. In the documentation in one place states that
the width of the scan area should be a byte multiple. In
another place it says that the width of the scan area should
be an even byte multiple. Go figure...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other sources
of bugs are due to scsi communication, scsi connects and
disconnects. However the classical bugs are still there. So
you may encounter buffer overruns, null pointers, memory
corruption and <b>SANE</b> API violations. <b><br>
SIGSEGV on SliceBars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When you try to modify the scan
area from the slice bar you have a nice little cute core
dump. I don&rsquo;t know why. If you select the scan area
from the preview window or by hand typing the numbers
everything is fine. The SIGSEGV happens deep in gtk library
(gdk). I really cannot debug it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Options too much</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is possible, especially for
the ColorOneScanner, for the backend&rsquo;s options panel
to extend beyond your screen. It happens with mine and I am
running my X Server at 1024x768. What can I say? Try smaller
fonts in the X server, or virtual screens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Weird SCSI behaviour</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">I am quoting David Myers
Here...</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&gt;&gt; OS:
FreeBSD 2.2.6 <br>
&gt;&gt; CC: egcs-1.02 <br>
Just wanted to follow up on this... I recently changed my
SCSI card from the Adaptec 2940UW to a dual-channel Symbios
786 chipset. When I started up SANE with your driver, I
managed to scan line art drawings okay, but Gray16 scans led
to a stream of SCSI error messages on the console,
ultimately hanging with a message saying the scanner
wasn&rsquo;t releasing the SCSI bus. This may be that the
Symbios is simply less tolerant of ancient hardware, or may
be bugs in your driver or in SANE itself...</p>

<h2>DEBUG
<a name="DEBUG"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
encounter a GUI bug please set the environmental variable
SANE_DEBUG_APPLE to 255 and rerun the exact sequence of
keystrokes and menu selections to reproduce it. Then send me
a report with the log attached.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have an
Apple Macintosh with the AppleScanners driver installed,
reporting to me which options are grayed out (inactive) in
what modes would be very helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
offer some help but you don&rsquo;t have a scanner, or you
don&rsquo;t have the model you would like to help with, or
you are a SANE developer and you just want to take a look at
how the apple backend looks like, goto to apple.h and
#define the NEUTRALIZE_BACKEND macro. You can select the
scanner model through the APPLE_MODEL_SELECT macro.
Available options are APPLESCANNER, ONESCANNER,
COLORONESCANNER.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or displaced
images please set the environment variable
SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 255 before sending me the
report.</p>
