<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PFM - PFM
graphic image file format</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the PFM graphic image file format as understood by
the Netpbm converters <b>pamtopfm</b>(1) <br>
and <b>pfmtopam</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
multiple similar formats known as PFM in the world, none of
them authoritatively documented. The format described here
is one that Bryan Henderson deduced from a program he found
somewhere that dealt with a &rsquo;PFM&rsquo; format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PFM format
is inspired by the Netpbm formats, and you will see lots of
similarity. It is not, however, an official Netpbm format.
Its goal is not consistent with those of Netpbm formats.</p>

<h2>The format
<a name="The format"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PFM image is
a stream of bytes. The stream consists of a header followed
immediately by a raster. These two components are described
below. There are no delimeters before or after the sections
as described.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PFM
header</b> <br>
The PFM header is 3 consecutive &rsquo;lines&rsquo; of ASCII
text. After each line is a white space character. That
character is typically a newline character, hence the term
&rsquo;line,&rsquo; but doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtopfm</b>
uses a newline in the PFM it generates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Identifier
Line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The identifier
line contains the characters &rsquo;PF&rsquo; or
&rsquo;Pf&rsquo;. PF means it&rsquo;s a color PFM. Pf means
it&rsquo;s a grayscale PFM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dimensions
Line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dimensions
line contains two positive decimal integers, separated by a
blank. The first is the width of the image; the second is
the height. Both are in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scale Factor
/ Endianness</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Scale
Factor / Endianness line is a queer line that jams
endianness information into an otherwise sane description of
a scale. The line consists of a nonzero decimal number, not
necessarily an integer. If the number is negative, that
means the PFM raster is little endian. Otherwise, it is big
endian. The absolute value of the number is the scale factor
for the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scale
factor tells the units of the samples in the raster. You use
somehow it along with some separately understood unit
information to turn a sample value into something
meaningful, such as watts per square meter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PFM
raster</b> <br>
The raster is a sequence of pixels, packed one after
another, with no delimiters of any kind. They are grouped by
row, with the pixels in each row ordered left to right and
the rows ordered bottom to top.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each pixel
consists of 1 or 3 samples, packed one after another, with
no delimiters of any kind. 1 sample for a grayscale PFM and
3 for a color PFM (see the Identifier Line of the PFM
header).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each sample
consists of 4 consecutive bytes. The bytes represent a 32
bit string, in either big endian or little endian format, as
determined by the Scale Factor / Endianness line of the PFM
header. That string is an IEEE 32 bit floating point number
code. Since that&rsquo;s the same format that most CPUs and
compiler use, you can usually just make a program use the
bytes directly as a floating point number, after taking care
of the endianness variation.</p>
