<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">smbpasswd
&minus; The Samba encrypted password file</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">smbpasswd</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This tool is
part of the <b>samba</b>(7) suite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">smbpasswd is
the Samba encrypted password file. It contains the username,
Unix user id and the SMB hashed passwords of the user, as
well as account flag information and the time the password
was last changed. This file format has been evolving with
Samba and has had several different formats in the past.</p>

<h2>FILE FORMAT
<a name="FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the smbpasswd file used by Samba 2.2 is very similar to the
familiar Unix passwd(5) file. It is an ASCII file containing
one line for each user. Each field within each line is
separated from the next by a colon. Any entry beginning with
'#' is ignored. The smbpasswd file contains the following
information for each user:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the user name. It must
be a name that already exists in the standard UNIX passwd
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">uid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the UNIX uid. It must
match the uid field for the same user entry in the standard
UNIX passwd file. If this does not match then Samba will
refuse to recognize this smbpasswd file entry as being valid
for a user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lanman Password
Hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the LANMAN hash of the
user's password, encoded as 32 hex digits. The LANMAN hash
is created by DES encrypting a well known string with the
user's password as the DES key. This is the same password
used by Windows 95/98 machines. Note that this password hash
is regarded as weak as it is vulnerable to dictionary
attacks and if two users choose the same password this entry
will be identical (i.e. the password is not
&quot;salted&quot; as the UNIX password is). If the user has
a null password this field will contain the characters
&quot;NO PASSWORD&quot; as the start of the hex string. If
the hex string is equal to 32 'X' characters then the user's
account is marked as <b>disabled</b> and the user will not
be able to log onto the Samba server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>WARNING
!!</i> Note that, due to the challenge&minus;response nature
of the SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, anyone with a
knowledge of this password hash will be able to impersonate
the user on the network. For this reason these hashes are
known as <i>plain text equivalents</i> and must <i>NOT</i>
be made available to anyone but the root user. To protect
these passwords the smbpasswd file is placed in a directory
with read and traverse access only to the root user and the
smbpasswd file itself must be set to be read/write only by
root, with no other access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NT Password
Hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the Windows NT hash of
the user's password, encoded as 32 hex digits. The Windows
NT hash is created by taking the user's password as
represented in 16&minus;bit, little&minus;endian UNICODE and
then applying the MD4 (internet rfc1321) hashing algorithm
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This password
hash is considered more secure than the LANMAN Password Hash
as it preserves the case of the password and uses a much
higher quality hashing algorithm. However, it is still the
case that if two users choose the same password this entry
will be identical (i.e. the password is not
&quot;salted&quot; as the UNIX password is).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>WARNING
!!</i>. Note that, due to the challenge&minus;response
nature of the SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, anyone with
a knowledge of this password hash will be able to
impersonate the user on the network. For this reason these
hashes are known as <i>plain text equivalents</i> and must
<i>NOT</i> be made available to anyone but the root user. To
protect these passwords the smbpasswd file is placed in a
directory with read and traverse access only to the root
user and the smbpasswd file itself must be set to be
read/write only by root, with no other access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Account
Flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This section contains flags
that describe the attributes of the users account. This
field is bracketed by '[' and ']' characters and is always
13 characters in length (including the '[' and ']'
characters). The contents of this field may be any of the
following characters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>U</i>
&minus; This means this is a &quot;User&quot; account, i.e.
an ordinary user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>N</i>
&minus; This means the account has no password (the
passwords in the fields LANMAN Password Hash and NT Password
Hash are ignored). Note that this will only allow users to
log on with no password if the <i><br>
null passwords</i> parameter is set in the
<b>smb.conf</b>(5) config file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>D</i>
&minus; This means the account is disabled and no SMB/CIFS
logins will be allowed for this user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>X</i>
&minus; This means the password does not expire.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>W</i>
&minus; This means this account is a &quot;Workstation
Trust&quot; account. This kind of account is used in the
Samba PDC code stream to allow Windows NT Workstations and
Servers to join a Domain hosted by a Samba PDC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other flags may
be added as the code is extended in future. The rest of this
field space is filled in with spaces. For further
information regarding the flags that are supported please
refer to the man page for the pdbedit command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Last Change
Time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This field consists of the time
the account was last modified. It consists of the characters
'LCT&minus;' (standing for &quot;Last Change Time&quot;)
followed by a numeric encoding of the UNIX time in seconds
since the epoch (1970) that the last change was made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other colon
separated fields are ignored at this time.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew
Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an
Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is
developed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent
piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
