<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unbound.conf</b>
is used to configure <i>unbound</i>(8). The file format has
attributes and values. Some attributes have attributes
inside them. The notation is: attribute: value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments start
with # and last to the end of line. Empty lines are ignored
as is whitespace at the beginning of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The utility
<i>unbound&minus;checkconf</i>(8) can be used to check
unbound.conf prior to usage.</p>

<h2>FILE FORMAT
<a name="FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There must be
whitespace between keywords. Attribute keywords end with a
colon &rsquo;:&rsquo;. An attribute is followed by its
containing attributes, or a value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files can be
included using the <b>include:</b> directive. It can appear
anywhere, it accepts a single file name as argument.
Processing continues as if the text from the included file
was copied into the config file at that point. If also using
chroot, using full path names for the included files works,
relative pathnames for the included names work if the
directory where the daemon is started equals its
chroot/working directory. Wildcards can be used to include
multiple files, see <i>glob</i>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Server
Options</b> <br>
These options are part of the <b>server:</b> clause. <b><br>
verbosity:</b> <i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The verbosity number, level 0
means no verbosity, only errors. Level 1 gives operational
information. Level 2 gives detailed operational information.
Level 3 gives query level information, output per query.
Level 4 gives algorithm level information. Level 5 logs
client identification for cache misses. Default is level 1.
The verbosity can also be increased from the commandline,
see <i>unbound</i>(8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>statistics&minus;interval:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of seconds between
printing statistics to the log for every thread. Disable
with value 0 or &quot;&quot;. Default is disabled. The
histogram statistics are only printed if replies were sent
during the statistics interval, requestlist statistics are
printed for every interval (but can be 0). This is because
the median calculation requires data to be present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>statistics&minus;cumulative:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, statistics are
cumulative since starting unbound, without clearing the
statistics counters after logging the statistics. Default is
no.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>extended&minus;statistics:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, extended statistics
are printed from <i>unbound&minus;control</i>(8). Default is
off, because keeping track of more statistics takes time.
The counters are listed in
<i>unbound&minus;control</i>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>num&minus;threads:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of threads to create
to serve clients. Use 1 for no threading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>port:</b> <i>&lt;port
number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The port number, default 53, on
which the server responds to queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>interface:</b> <i>&lt;ip
address[@port]&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Interface to use to connect to
the network. This interface is listened to for queries from
clients, and answers to clients are given from it. Can be
given multiple times to work on several interfaces. If none
are given the default is to listen to localhost. The
interfaces are not changed on a reload (kill &minus;HUP) but
only on restart. A port number can be specified with @port
(without spaces between interface and port number), if not
specified the default port (from <b>port</b>) is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>interface&minus;automatic:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Detect source interface on UDP
queries and copy them to replies. This feature is
experimental, and needs support in your OS for particular
socket options. Default value is no.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outgoing&minus;interface:</b>
<i>&lt;ip address&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Interface to use to connect to
the network. This interface is used to send queries to
authoritative servers and receive their replies. Can be
given multiple times to work on several interfaces. If none
are given the default (all) is used. You can specify the
same interfaces in <b>interface:</b> and
<b>outgoing&minus;interface:</b> lines, the interfaces are
then used for both purposes. Outgoing queries are sent via a
random outgoing interface to counter spoofing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outgoing&minus;range:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of ports to open. This
number of file descriptors can be opened per thread. Must be
at least 1. Default depends on compile options. Larger
numbers need extra resources from the operating system. For
performance a a very large value is best, use libevent to
make this possible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outgoing&minus;port&minus;permit:</b>
<i>&lt;port number or range&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Permit unbound to open this
port or range of ports for use to send queries. A larger
number of permitted outgoing ports increases resilience
against spoofing attempts. Make sure these ports are not
needed by other daemons. By default only ports above 1024
that have not been assigned by IANA are used. Give a port
number or a range of the form &quot;low&minus;high&quot;,
without spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>outgoing&minus;port&minus;permit</b> and
<b>outgoing&minus;port&minus;avoid</b> statements are
processed in the line order of the config file, adding the
permitted ports and subtracting the avoided ports from the
set of allowed ports. The processing starts with the non
IANA allocated ports above 1024 in the set of allowed
ports.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outgoing&minus;port&minus;avoid:</b>
<i>&lt;port number or range&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not permit unbound to open
this port or range of ports for use to send queries. Use
this to make sure unbound does not grab a port that another
daemon needs. The port is avoided on all outgoing
interfaces, both IP4 and IP6. By default only ports above
1024 that have not been assigned by IANA are used. Give a
port number or a range of the form
&quot;low&minus;high&quot;, without spaces.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outgoing&minus;num&minus;tcp:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of outgoing TCP buffers
to allocate per thread. Default is 10. If set to 0, or if
do_tcp is &quot;no&quot;, no TCP queries to authoritative
servers are done.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>incoming&minus;num&minus;tcp:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of incoming TCP buffers
to allocate per thread. Default is 10. If set to 0, or if
do_tcp is &quot;no&quot;, no TCP queries from clients are
accepted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>edns&minus;buffer&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size to
advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer size. This is the
value put into datagrams over UDP towards peers. The actual
buffer size is determined by msg&minus;buffer&minus;size
(both for TCP and UDP). Do not set higher than that value.
Default is 4096 which is RFC recommended. If you have
fragmentation reassembly problems, usually seen as timeouts,
then a value of 1480 can fix it. Setting to 512 bypasses
even the most stringent path MTU problems, but is seen as
extreme, since the amount of TCP fallback generated is
excessive (probably also for this resolver, consider tuning
the outgoing tcp number).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>msg&minus;buffer&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size of the
message buffers. Default is 65552 bytes, enough for 64 Kb
packets, the maximum DNS message size. No message larger
than this can be sent or received. Can be reduced to use
less memory, but some requests for DNS data, such as for
huge resource records, will result in a SERVFAIL reply to
the client.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>msg&minus;cache&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size of the
message cache. Default is 4 megabytes. A plain number is in
bytes, append &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo; or
&rsquo;g&rsquo; for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes
(1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>msg&minus;cache&minus;slabs:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of slabs in the message
cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads. Must be set
to a power of 2. Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a
reasonable guess.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>num&minus;queries&minus;per&minus;thread:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of queries that
every thread will service simultaneously. If more queries
arrive that need servicing, and no queries can be jostled
out (see <i>jostle&minus;timeout</i>), then the queries are
dropped. This forces the client to resend after a timeout;
allowing the server time to work on the existing queries.
Default depends on compile options, 512 or 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>jostle&minus;timeout:</b>
<i>&lt;msec&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Timeout used when the server is
very busy. Set to a value that usually results in one
roundtrip to the authority servers. If too many queries
arrive, then 50% of the queries are allowed to run to
completion, and the other 50% are replaced with the new
incoming query if they have already spent more than their
allowed time. This protects against denial of service by
slow queries or high query rates. Default 200 milliseconds.
The effect is that the qps for long-lasting queries is about
(numqueriesperthread / 2) / (average time for such long
queries) qps. The qps for short queries can be about
(numqueriesperthread / 2) / (jostletimeout in whole seconds)
qps per thread, about (1024/2)*5 = 2560 qps by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>so&minus;rcvbuf:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If not 0, then set the
SO_RCVBUF socket option to get more buffer space on UDP port
53 incoming queries. So that short spikes on busy servers do
not drop packets (see counter in netstat &minus;su). Default
is 0 (use system value). Otherwise, the number of bytes to
ask for, try &quot;4m&quot; on a busy server. The OS caps it
at a maximum, on linux unbound needs root permission to
bypass the limit, or the admin can use sysctl
net.core.rmem_max. On BSD change kern.ipc.maxsockbuf in
/etc/sysctl.conf. On OpenBSD change header and recompile
kernel. On Solaris ndd &minus;set /dev/udp udp_max_buf
8388608.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>so&minus;sndbuf:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If not 0, then set the
SO_SNDBUF socket option to get more buffer space on UDP port
53 outgoing queries. This for very busy servers handles
spikes in answer traffic, otherwise &rsquo;send: resource
temporarily unavailable&rsquo; can get logged, the buffer
overrun is also visible by netstat &minus;su. Default is 0
(use system value). Specify the number of bytes to ask for,
try &quot;4m&quot; on a very busy server. The OS caps it at
a maximum, on linux unbound needs root permission to bypass
the limit, or the admin can use sysctl net.core.wmem_max. On
BSD, Solaris changes are similar to so&minus;rcvbuf.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>rrset&minus;cache&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size of the
RRset cache. Default is 4 megabytes. A plain number is in
bytes, append &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo; or
&rsquo;g&rsquo; for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes
(1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>rrset&minus;cache&minus;slabs:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of slabs in the RRset
cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads. Must be set
to a power of 2.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>cache&minus;max&minus;ttl:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Time to live maximum for RRsets
and messages in the cache. Default is 86400 seconds (1 day).
If the maximum kicks in, responses to clients still get
decrementing TTLs based on the original (larger) values.
When the internal TTL expires, the cache item has expired.
Can be set lower to force the resolver to query for data
often, and not trust (very large) TTL values.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>cache&minus;min&minus;ttl:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Time to live minimum for RRsets
and messages in the cache. Default is 0. If the the minimum
kicks in, the data is cached for longer than the domain
owner intended, and thus less queries are made to look up
the data. Zero makes sure the data in the cache is as the
domain owner intended, higher values, especially more than
an hour or so, can lead to trouble as the data in the cache
does not match up with the actual data any more.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>infra&minus;host&minus;ttl:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Time to live for entries in the
host cache. The host cache contains roundtrip timing,
lameness and EDNS support information. Default is 900.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>infra&minus;cache&minus;slabs:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of slabs in the
infrastructure cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by
threads. Must be set to a power of 2.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>infra&minus;cache&minus;numhosts:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of hosts for which
information is cached. Default is 10000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;ip4:</b> <i>&lt;yes
or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether ip4
queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;ip6:</b> <i>&lt;yes
or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether ip6
queries are answered or issued. Default is yes. If disabled,
queries are not answered on IPv6, and queries are not sent
on IPv6 to the internet nameservers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;udp:</b> <i>&lt;yes
or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether UDP
queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;tcp:</b> <i>&lt;yes
or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether TCP
queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcp&minus;upstream:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether the
upstream queries use TCP only for transport. Default is no.
Useful in tunneling scenarios.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ssl&minus;upstream:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enabled or disable whether the
upstream queries use SSL only for transport. Default is no.
Useful in tunneling scenarios. The SSL contains plain DNS in
TCP wireformat. The other server must support this (see
<b>ssl&minus;service&minus;key</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ssl&minus;service-key:</b>
<i>&lt;file&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, the server provider
SSL service on its TCP sockets. The clients have to use
ssl&minus;upstream: yes. The file is the private key for the
TLS session. The public certificate is in the
ssl&minus;service&minus;pem file. Default is &quot;&quot;,
turned off. Requires a restart (a reload is not enough) if
changed, because the private key is read while root
permissions are held and before chroot (if any). Normal DNS
TCP service is not provided and gives errors, this service
is best run with a different <b>port:</b> config or
<i>@port</i> suffixes in the <b>interface</b> config.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ssl&minus;service&minus;pem:</b>
<i>&lt;file&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The public key certificate pem
file for the ssl service. Default is &quot;&quot;, turned
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ssl&minus;port:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The port number on which to
provide TCP SSL service, default 443, only interfaces
configured with that port number as @number get the SSL
service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;daemonize:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable whether the
unbound server forks into the background as a daemon.
Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>access&minus;control:</b>
<i>&lt;IP netblock&gt; &lt;action&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The netblock is given as an IP4
or IP6 address with /size appended for a classless network
block. The action can be <i>deny</i>, <i>refuse</i>,
<i>allow</i> or <i>allow_snoop</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The action
<i>deny</i> stops queries from hosts from that netblock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The action
<i>refuse</i> stops queries too, but sends a DNS rcode
REFUSED error message back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The action
<i>allow</i> gives access to clients from that netblock. It
gives only access for recursion clients (which is what
almost all clients need). Nonrecursive queries are
refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>allow</i> action does allow nonrecursive queries to
access the local&minus;data that is configured. The reason
is that this does not involve the unbound server recursive
lookup algorithm, and static data is served in the reply.
This supports normal operations where nonrecursive queries
are made for the authoritative data. For nonrecursive
queries any replies from the dynamic cache are refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The action
<i>allow_snoop</i> gives nonrecursive access too. This give
both recursive and non recursive access. The name
<i>allow_snoop</i> refers to cache snooping, a technique to
use nonrecursive queries to examine the cache contents (for
malicious acts). However, nonrecursive queries can also be a
valuable debugging tool (when you want to examine the cache
contents). In that case use <i>allow_snoop</i> for your
administration host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default only
localhost is <i>allow</i>ed, the rest is <i>refuse</i>d. The
default is <i>refuse</i>d, because that is
protocol&minus;friendly. The DNS protocol is not designed to
handle dropped packets due to policy, and dropping may
result in (possibly excessive) retried queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chroot:</b>
<i>&lt;directory&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If chroot is enabled, you
should pass the configfile (from the commandline) as a full
path from the original root. After the chroot has been
performed the now defunct portion of the config file path is
removed to be able to reread the config after a reload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">All other file
paths (working dir, logfile, roothints, and key files) can
be specified in several ways: as an absolute path relative
to the new root, as a relative path to the working
directory, or as an absolute path relative to the original
root. In the last case the path is adjusted to remove the
unused portion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The pidfile can
be either a relative path to the working directory, or an
absolute path relative to the original root. It is written
just prior to chroot and dropping permissions. This allows
the pidfile to be /var/run/unbound.pid and the chroot to be
/var/unbound, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
unbound may need to access /dev/random (for entropy) from
inside the chroot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If given a
chroot is done to the given directory. The default is
&quot;/etc/unbound&quot;. If you give &quot;&quot; no chroot
is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>username:</b>
<i>&lt;name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If given, after binding the
port the user privileges are dropped. Default is
&quot;unbound&quot;. If you give username: &quot;&quot; no
user change is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If this user is
not capable of binding the port, reloads (by signal HUP)
will still retain the opened ports. If you change the port
number in the config file, and that new port number requires
privileges, then a reload will fail; a restart is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>directory:</b>
<i>&lt;directory&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the working directory for
the program. Default is &quot;/etc/unbound&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>logfile:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If &quot;&quot; is given,
logging goes to stderr, or nowhere once daemonized. The
logfile is appended to, in the following format: <br>
[seconds since 1970] unbound[pid:tid]: type: message. <br>
If this option is given, the use&minus;syslog is option is
set to &quot;no&quot;. The logfile is reopened (for append)
when the config file is reread, on SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>use&minus;syslog:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets unbound to send log
messages to the syslogd, using <i>syslog</i>(3). The log
facility LOG_DAEMON is used, with identity
&quot;unbound&quot;. The logfile setting is overridden when
use&minus;syslog is turned on. The default is to log to
syslog.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>log&minus;time&minus;ascii:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets logfile lines to use a
timestamp in UTC ascii. Default is no, which prints the
seconds since 1970 in brackets. No effect if using syslog,
in that case syslog formats the timestamp printed into the
log files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>log&minus;queries:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints one line per query to
the log, with the log timestamp and IP address, name, type
and class. Default is no. Note that it takes time to print
these lines which makes the server (significantly) slower.
Odd (nonprintable) characters in names are printed as
&rsquo;?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pidfile:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The process id is written to
the file. Default is
&quot;/var/run/unbound/unbound.pid&quot;. So, <br>
kill &minus;HUP &lsquo;cat
/var/run/unbound/unbound.pid&lsquo; <br>
triggers a reload, <br>
kill &minus;QUIT &lsquo;cat
/var/run/unbound/unbound.pid&lsquo; <br>
gracefully terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>root&minus;hints:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read the root hints from this
file. Default is nothing, using builtin hints for the IN
class. The file has the format of zone files, with root
nameserver names and addresses only. The default may become
outdated, when servers change, therefore it is good practice
to use a root&minus;hints file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hide&minus;identity:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled id.server and
hostname.bind queries are refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>identity:</b>
<i>&lt;string&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the identity to report. If
set to &quot;&quot;, the default, then the hostname of the
server is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hide&minus;version:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled version.server and
version.bind queries are refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>version:</b>
<i>&lt;string&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the version to report. If
set to &quot;&quot;, the default, then the package version
is returned.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>target&minus;fetch&minus;policy:</b>
<i>&lt;&quot;list of numbers&quot;&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the target fetch policy
used by unbound to determine if it should fetch nameserver
target addresses opportunistically. The policy is described
per dependency depth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
values determines the maximum dependency depth that unbound
will pursue in answering a query. A value of &minus;1 means
to fetch all targets opportunistically for that dependency
depth. A value of 0 means to fetch on demand only. A
positive value fetches that many targets
opportunistically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Enclose the
list between quotes (&quot;&quot;) and put spaces between
numbers. The default is &quot;3 2 1 0 0&quot;. Setting all
zeroes, &quot;0 0 0 0 0&quot; gives behaviour closer to that
of BIND 9, while setting &quot;&minus;1 &minus;1 &minus;1
&minus;1 &minus;1&quot; gives behaviour rumoured to be
closer to that of BIND 8.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;short&minus;bufsize:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Very small EDNS buffer sizes
from queries are ignored. Default is off, since it is legal
protocol wise to send these, and unbound tries to give very
small answers to these queries, where possible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;large&minus;queries:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Very large queries are ignored.
Default is off, since it is legal protocol wise to send
these, and could be necessary for operation if TSIG or EDNS
payload is very large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;glue:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Will trust glue only if it is
within the servers authority. Default is on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;dnssec&minus;stripped:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Require DNSSEC data for
trust&minus;anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone
becomes bogus. If turned off, and no DNSSEC data is received
(or the DNSKEY data fails to validate), then the zone is
made insecure, this behaves like there is no trust anchor.
You could turn this off if you are sometimes behind an
intrusive firewall (of some sort) that removes DNSSEC data
from packets, or a zone changes from signed to unsigned to
badly signed often. If turned off you run the risk of a
downgrade attack that disables security for a zone. Default
is on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;below&minus;nxdomain:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">From
draft-vixie-dnsext-resimprove, returns nxdomain to queries
for a name below another name that is already known to be
nxdomain. DNSSEC mandates noerror for empty nonterminals,
hence this is possible. Very old software might return
nxdomain for empty nonterminals (that usually happen for
reverse IP address lookups), and thus may be incompatible
with this. To try to avoid this only DNSSEC-secure nxdomains
are used, because the old software does not have DNSSEC.
Default is off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>harden&minus;referral&minus;path:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Harden the referral path by
performing additional queries for infrastructure data.
Validates the replies if trust anchors are configured and
the zones are signed. This enforces DNSSEC validation on
nameserver NS sets and the nameserver addresses that are
encountered on the referral path to the answer. Default off,
because it burdens the authority servers, and it is not RFC
standard, and could lead to performance problems because of
the extra query load that is generated. Experimental option.
If you enable it consider adding more numbers after the
target&minus;fetch&minus;policy to increase the max depth
that is checked to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>use&minus;caps&minus;for&minus;id:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use 0x20&minus;encoded random
bits in the query to foil spoof attempts. This perturbs the
lowercase and uppercase of query names sent to authority
servers and checks if the reply still has the correct
casing. Disabled by default. This feature is an experimental
implementation of draft dns&minus;0x20.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>private&minus;address:</b>
<i>&lt;IP address or subnet&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Give IPv4 of IPv6 addresses or
classless subnets. These are addresses on your private
network, and are not allowed to be returned for public
internet names. Any occurence of such addresses are removed
from DNS answers. Additionally, the DNSSEC validator may
mark the answers bogus. This protects against
so&minus;called DNS Rebinding, where a user browser is
turned into a network proxy, allowing remote access through
the browser to other parts of your private network. Some
names can be allowed to contain your private addresses, by
default all the <b>local&minus;data</b> that you configured
is allowed to, and you can specify additional names using
<b>private&minus;domain</b>. No private addresses are
enabled by default. We consider to enable this for the
RFC1918 private IP address space by default in later
releases. That would enable private addresses for 10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 169.254.0.0/16 fd00::/8 and
fe80::/10, since the RFC standards say these addresses
should not be visible on the public internet. Turning on
127.0.0.0/8 would hinder many spamblocklists as they use
that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>private&minus;domain:</b>
<i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow this domain, and all its
subdomains to contain private addresses. Give multiple times
to allow multiple domain names to contain private addresses.
Default is none.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>unwanted&minus;reply&minus;threshold:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, a total number of
unwanted replies is kept track of in every thread. When it
reaches the threshold, a defensive action is taken and a
warning is printed to the log. The defensive action is to
clear the rrset and message caches, hopefully flushing away
any poison. A value of 10 million is suggested. Default is 0
(turned off).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;not&minus;query&minus;address:</b>
<i>&lt;IP address&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not query the given IP
address. Can be IP4 or IP6. Append /num to indicate a
classless delegation netblock, for example like 10.2.3.4/24
or 2001::11/64.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>do&minus;not&minus;query&minus;localhost:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If yes, localhost is added to
the do&minus;not&minus;query&minus;address entries, both IP6
::1 and IP4 127.0.0.1/8. If no, then localhost can be used
to send queries to. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>prefetch:</b> <i>&lt;yes or
no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If yes, message cache elements
are prefetched before they expire to keep the cache up to
date. Default is no. Turning it on gives about 10 percent
more traffic and load on the machine, but popular items do
not expire from the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>prefetch-key:</b> <i>&lt;yes
or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If yes, fetch the DNSKEYs
earlier in the validation process, when a DS record is
encountered. This lowers the latency of requests. It does
use a little more CPU. Also if the cache is set to 0, it is
no use. Default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>rrset-roundrobin:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If yes, Unbound rotates RRSet
order in response (the random number is taken from the query
ID, for speed and thread safety). Default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>minimal-responses:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If yes, Unbound doesn&rsquo;t
insert authority/additional sections into response messages
when those sections are not required. This reduces response
size significantly, and may avoid TCP fallback for some
responses. This may cause a slight speedup. The default is
no, because the DNS protocol RFCs mandate these sections,
and the additional content could be of use and save
roundtrips for clients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>module&minus;config:</b>
<i>&lt;&quot;module names&quot;&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Module configuration, a list of
module names separated by spaces, surround the string with
quotes (&quot;&quot;). The modules can be validator,
iterator. Setting this to &quot;iterator&quot; will result
in a non&minus;validating server. Setting this to
&quot;validator iterator&quot; will turn on DNSSEC
validation. The ordering of the modules is important. You
must also set trust&minus;anchors for validation to be
useful.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trust&minus;anchor&minus;file:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File with trusted keys for
validation. Both DS and DNSKEY entries can appear in the
file. The format of the file is the standard DNS Zone file
format. Default is &quot;&quot;, or no trust anchor
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto&minus;trust&minus;anchor&minus;file:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File with trust anchor for one
zone, which is tracked with RFC5011 probes. The probes are
several times per month, thus the machine must be online
frequently. The initial file can be one with contents as
described in <b>trust&minus;anchor&minus;file</b>. The file
is written to when the anchor is updated, so the unbound
user must have write permission.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trust&minus;anchor:</b>
<i>&lt;&quot;Resource Record&quot;&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A DS or DNSKEY RR for a key to
use for validation. Multiple entries can be given to specify
multiple trusted keys, in addition to the
trust&minus;anchor&minus;files. The resource record is
entered in the same format as &rsquo;dig&rsquo; or
&rsquo;drill&rsquo; prints them, the same format as in the
zone file. Has to be on a single line, with &quot;&quot;
around it. A TTL can be specified for ease of cut and paste,
but is ignored. A class can be specified, but class IN is
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trusted&minus;keys&minus;file:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File with trusted keys for
validation. Specify more than one file with several entries,
one file per entry. Like
<b>trust&minus;anchor&minus;file</b> but has a different
file format. Format is BIND&minus;9 style format, the
trusted&minus;keys { name flag proto algo &quot;key&quot;;
}; clauses are read. It is possible to use wildcards with
this statement, the wildcard is expanded on start and on
reload.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dlv&minus;anchor&minus;file:</b>
<i>&lt;filename&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File with trusted keys for DLV
(DNSSEC Lookaside Validation). Both DS and DNSKEY entries
can be used in the file, in the same format as for
<i>trust&minus;anchor&minus;file:</i> statements. Only one
DLV can be configured, more would be slow. The DLV
configured is used as a root trusted DLV, this means that it
is a lookaside for the root. Default is &quot;&quot;, or no
dlv anchor file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dlv&minus;anchor:</b>
<i>&lt;&quot;Resource Record&quot;&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Much like trust&minus;anchor,
this is a DLV anchor with the DS or DNSKEY inline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>domain&minus;insecure:</b>
<i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets domain name to be
insecure, DNSSEC chain of trust is ignored towards the
domain name. So a trust anchor above the domain name can not
make the domain secure with a DS record, such a DS record is
then ignored. Also keys from DLV are ignored for the domain.
Can be given multiple times to specify multiple domains that
are treated as if unsigned. If you set trust anchors for the
domain they override this setting (and the domain is
secured).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful if you want to make sure a trust anchor for external
lookups does not affect an (unsigned) internal domain. A DS
record externally can create validation failures for that
internal domain.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;override&minus;date:</b>
<i>&lt;rrsig&minus;style date spec&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default is &quot;&quot; or
&quot;0&quot;, which disables this debugging feature. If
enabled by giving a RRSIG style date, that date is used for
verifying RRSIG inception and expiration dates, instead of
the current date. Do not set this unless you are debugging
signature inception and expiration. The value &minus;1
ignores the date altogether, useful for some special
applications.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;sig&minus;skew&minus;min:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Minimum number of seconds of
clock skew to apply to validated signatures. A value of 10%
of the signature lifetime (expiration &minus; inception) is
used, capped by this setting. Default is 3600 (1 hour) which
allows for daylight savings differences. Lower this value
for more strict checking of short lived signatures.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;sig&minus;skew&minus;max:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum number of seconds of
clock skew to apply to validated signatures. A value of 10%
of the signature lifetime (expiration &minus; inception) is
used, capped by this setting. Default is 86400 (24 hours)
which allows for timezone setting problems in stable
domains. Setting both min and max very low disables the
clock skew allowances. Setting both min and max very high
makes the validator check the signature timestamps less
strictly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;bogus&minus;ttl:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The time to live for bogus
data. This is data that has failed validation; due to
invalid signatures or other checks. The TTL from that data
cannot be trusted, and this value is used instead. The value
is in seconds, default 60. The time interval prevents
repeated revalidation of bogus data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;clean&minus;additional:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct the validator to
remove data from the additional section of secure messages
that are not signed properly. Messages that are insecure,
bogus, indeterminate or unchecked are not affected. Default
is yes. Use this setting to protect the users that rely on
this validator for authentication from protentially bad data
in the additional section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;log&minus;level:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Have the validator print
validation failures to the log. Regardless of the verbosity
setting. Default is 0, off. At 1, for every user query that
fails a line is printed to the logs. This way you can
monitor what happens with validation. Use a diagnosis tool,
such as dig or drill, to find out why validation is failing
for these queries. At 2, not only the query that failed is
printed but also the reason why unbound thought it was wrong
and which server sent the faulty data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;permissive&minus;mode:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct the validator to mark
bogus messages as indeterminate. The security checks are
performed, but if the result is bogus (failed security), the
reply is not withheld from the client with SERVFAIL as
usual. The client receives the bogus data. For messages that
are found to be secure the AD bit is set in replies. Also
logging is performed as for full validation. The default
value is &quot;no&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ignore&minus;cd&minus;flag:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct unbound to ignore the
CD flag from clients and refuse to return bogus answers to
them. Thus, the CD (Checking Disabled) flag does not disable
checking any more. This is useful if legacy (w2008) servers
that set the CD flag but cannot validate DNSSEC themselves
are the clients, and then unbound provides them with DNSSEC
protection. The default value is &quot;no&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>val&minus;nsec3&minus;keysize&minus;iterations:</b>
<i>&lt;&quot;list of values&quot;&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List of keysize and iteration
count values, separated by spaces, surrounded by quotes.
Default is &quot;1024 150 2048 500 4096 2500&quot;. This
determines the maximum allowed NSEC3 iteration count before
a message is simply marked insecure instead of performing
the many hashing iterations. The list must be in ascending
order and have at least one entry. If you set it to
&quot;1024 65535&quot; there is no restriction to NSEC3
iteration values. This table must be kept short; a very long
list could cause slower operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>add&minus;holddown:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct the
<b>auto&minus;trust&minus;anchor&minus;file</b> probe
mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust updates to add new trust
anchors only after they have been visible for this time.
Default is 30 days as per the RFC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>del&minus;holddown:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct the
<b>auto&minus;trust&minus;anchor&minus;file</b> probe
mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust updates to remove revoked
trust anchors after they have been kept in the revoked list
for this long. Default is 30 days as per the RFC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>keep&minus;missing:</b>
<i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instruct the
<b>auto&minus;trust&minus;anchor&minus;file</b> probe
mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust updates to remove missing
trust anchors after they have been unseen for this long.
This cleans up the state file if the target zone does not
perform trust anchor revocation, so this makes the auto
probe mechanism work with zones that perform regular
(non&minus;5011) rollovers. The default is 366 days. The
value 0 does not remove missing anchors, as per the RFC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>key&minus;cache&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size of the key
cache. Default is 4 megabytes. A plain number is in bytes,
append &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;g&rsquo;
for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a
megabyte).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>key&minus;cache&minus;slabs:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of slabs in the key
cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads. Must be set
to a power of 2. Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a
reasonable guess.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>neg&minus;cache&minus;size:</b>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of bytes size of the
aggressive negative cache. Default is 1 megabyte. A plain
number is in bytes, append &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo;
or &rsquo;g&rsquo; for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes
(1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local&minus;zone:</b>
<i>&lt;zone&gt; &lt;type&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Configure a local zone. The
type determines the answer to give if there is no match from
local&minus;data. The types are deny, refuse, static,
transparent, redirect, nodefault, typetransparent, and are
explained below. After that the default settings are listed.
Use local&minus;data: to enter data into the local zone.
Answers for local zones are authoritative DNS answers. By
default the zones are class IN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
more complicated authoritative data, with referrals,

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>refuse</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Send an error message reply,
with rcode REFUSED. If there is a match from local data, the
query is answered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>static</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">If there is a match from local
data, the query is answered. Otherwise, the query is
answered with nodata or nxdomain. For a negative answer a
SOA is included in the answer if present as local&minus;data
for the zone apex domain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>transparent</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">If there is a match from local
data, the query is answered. Otherwise if the query has a
different name, the query is resolved normally. If the query
is for a name given in localdata but no such type of data is
given in localdata, then a noerror nodata answer is
returned. If no local&minus;zone is given local&minus;data
causes a transparent zone to be created by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>typetransparent</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">If there is a match from local
data, the query is answered. If the query is for a different
name, or for the same name but for a different type, the
query is resolved normally. So, similar to transparent but
types that are not listed in local data are resolved
normally, so if an A record is in the local data that does
not cause a nodata reply for AAAA queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>redirect</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">The query is answered from the
local data for the zone name. There may be no local data
beneath the zone name. This answers queries for the zone,
and all subdomains of the zone with the local data for the
zone. It can be used to redirect a domain to return a
different address record to the end user, with
local&minus;zone: &quot;example.com.&quot; redirect and
local&minus;data: &quot;example.com. A 127.0.0.1&quot;
queries for www.example.com and www.foo.example.com are
redirected, so that users with web browsers cannot access
sites with suffix example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>nodefault</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Used to turn off default
contents for AS112 zones. The other types also turn off
default contents for the zone. The &rsquo;nodefault&rsquo;
option has no other effect than turning off default contents
for the given zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
zones are localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and the
AS112 zones. The AS112 zones are reverse DNS zones for
private use and reserved IP addresses for which the servers
on the internet cannot provide correct answers. They are
configured by default to give nxdomain (no reverse

You can also selectively unblock a part of the zone by

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local&minus;data:</b>
<i>&quot;&lt;resource record string&gt;&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Configure local data, which is
served in reply to queries for it. The query has to match
exactly unless you configure the local&minus;zone as
redirect. If not matched exactly, the local&minus;zone type
determines further processing. If local&minus;data is
configured that is not a subdomain of a local&minus;zone, a
transparent local&minus;zone is configured. For record types
such as TXT, use single quotes, as in local&minus;data:
&rsquo;example. TXT &quot;text&quot;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
more complicated authoritative data, with referrals,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Remote
Control Options</b> <br>
In the <b>remote&minus;control:</b> clause are the
declarations for the remote control facility. If this is
enabled, the <i>unbound&minus;control</i>(8) utility can be
used to send commands to the running unbound server. The
server uses these clauses to setup SSLv3 / TLSv1 security
for the connection. The <i>unbound&minus;control</i>(8)
utility also reads the <b>remote&minus;control</b> section
for options. To setup the correct self&minus;signed
certificates use the
<i>unbound&minus;control&minus;setup</i>(8) utility. <b><br>
control&minus;enable:</b> <i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The option is used to enable
remote control, default is &quot;no&quot;. If turned off,
the server does not listen for control commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>control&minus;interface:
&lt;ip address&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Give IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to
listen on for control commands. By default localhost
(127.0.0.1 and ::1) is listened to. Use 0.0.0.0 and ::0 to
listen to all interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>control&minus;port: &lt;port
number&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The port number to listen on
for control commands, default is 8953. If you change this
port number, and permissions have been dropped, a reload is
not sufficient to open the port again, you must then
restart.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>server&minus;key&minus;file:
&lt;private key file&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Path to the server private key,
by default unbound_server.key. This file is generated by the
<i>unbound&minus;control&minus;setup</i> utility. This file
is used by the unbound server, but not by
<i>unbound&minus;control</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>server&minus;cert&minus;file:
&lt;certificate file.pem&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Path to the server self signed

by <i>unbound&minus;control</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>control&minus;key&minus;file:
&lt;private key file&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Path to the control client

is used by <i>unbound&minus;control</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Stub Zone
Options</b> <br>
There may be multiple <b>stub&minus;zone:</b> clauses. Each
with a name: and zero or more hostnames or IP addresses. For
the stub zone this list of nameservers is used. Class IN is
assumed. The servers should be authority servers, not
recursors; unbound performs the recursive processing itself
for stub zones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The stub zone
can be used to configure authoritative data to be used by
the resolver that cannot be accessed using the public
internet servers. This is useful for company&minus;local
data or private zones. Setup an authoritative server on a
different host (or different port). Enter a config entry for
unbound with <b>stub&minus;addr:</b> &lt;ip address of
host[@port]&gt;. The unbound resolver can then access the
data, without referring to the public internet for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This setup
allows DNSSEC signed zones to be served by that
authoritative server, in which case a trusted key entry with
the public key can be put in config, so that unbound can
validate the data and set the AD bit on replies for the
private zone (authoritative servers do not set the AD bit).
This setup makes unbound capable of answering queries for
the private zone, and can even set the AD bit
(&rsquo;authentic&rsquo;), but the AA
(&rsquo;authoritative&rsquo;) bit is not set on these
replies. <b><br>
name:</b> <i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Name of the stub zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub&minus;host:</b>
<i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Name of stub zone nameserver.
Is itself resolved before it is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub&minus;addr:</b>
<i>&lt;IP address&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">IP address of stub zone
nameserver. Can be IP 4 or IP 6. To use a nondefault port
for DNS communication append &rsquo;@&rsquo; with the port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub&minus;prime:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is by default off.
If enabled it performs NS set priming, which is similar to
root hints, where it starts using the list of nameservers
currently published by the zone. Thus, if the hint list is
slightly outdated, the resolver picks up a correct list
online.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub&minus;first:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, a query is
attempted without the stub clause if it fails. The data
could not be retrieved and would have caused SERVFAIL
because the servers are unreachable, instead it is tried
without this clause. The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Forward Zone
Options</b> <br>
There may be multiple <b>forward&minus;zone:</b> clauses.
Each with a <b>name:</b> and zero or more hostnames or IP
addresses. For the forward zone this list of nameservers is
used to forward the queries to. The servers listed as
<b>forward&minus;host:</b> and <b>forward&minus;addr:</b>
have to handle further recursion for the query. Thus, those
servers are not authority servers, but are (just like
unbound is) recursive servers too; unbound does not perform
recursion itself for the forward zone, it lets the remote
server do it. Class IN is assumed. A forward&minus;zone
entry with name &quot;.&quot; and a forward&minus;addr
target will forward all queries to that other server (unless
it can answer from the cache). <b><br>
name:</b> <i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Name of the forward zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward&minus;host:</b>
<i>&lt;domain name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Name of server to forward to.
Is itself resolved before it is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward&minus;addr:</b>
<i>&lt;IP address&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">IP address of server to forward
to. Can be IP 4 or IP 6. To use a nondefault port for DNS
communication append &rsquo;@&rsquo; with the port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward&minus;first:</b>
<i>&lt;yes or no&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, a query is
attempted without the forward clause if it fails. The data
could not be retrieved and would have caused SERVFAIL
because the servers are unreachable, instead it is tried
without this clause. The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Python
Module Options</b> <br>
The <b>python:</b> clause gives the settings for the
<i>python</i>(1) script module. This module acts like the
iterator and validator modules do, on queries and answers.
To enable the script module it has to be compiled into the
daemon, and the word &quot;python&quot; has to be put in the
<b>module&minus;config:</b> option (usually first, or
between the validator and iterator). <b><br>
python&minus;script:</b> <i>&lt;python file&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The script file to load.</p>
