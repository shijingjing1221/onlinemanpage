<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The more you
think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you&rsquo;ll realize that the majority of programmer effort
has to go into converting between the data structures that
are native to either of the languages involved. This trumps
other matter such as differing calling conventions because
the problem space is so much greater. There are simply more
ways to shove data into memory than there are ways to
implement a function call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl
<small>XS</small> &rsquo; attempt at a solution to this is
the concept of typemaps. At an abstract level, a Perl
<small>XS</small> typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C
data structure and vice versa. Since there can be C types
that are sufficiently similar to warrant converting with the
same logic, <small>XS</small> typemaps are represented by a
unique identifier, henceforth called an &lt;
<small>XS</small> type&gt; in this document. You can then
tell the <small>XS</small> compiler that multiple C types
are to be mapped with the same <small>XS</small>
typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In your
<small>XS</small> code, when you define an argument with a C
type or when you are using a <tt>&quot;CODE:&quot;</tt> and
an <tt>&quot;OUTPUT:&quot;</tt> section together with a C
return type of your <small>XSUB</small> , it&rsquo;ll be the
typemapping mechanism that makes this easy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Anatomy of a
typemap</b> <br>
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler to
map C function parameters and values to Perl values. The
typemap file may consist of three sections labelled
<tt>&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt>,
and <tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt>. An unlabelled initial
section is assumed to be a <tt>&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</tt>
section. The <small>INPUT</small> section tells the compiler
how to translate Perl values into variables of certain C
types. The <small>OUTPUT</small> section tells the compiler
how to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand. The <small>TYPEMAP</small> section
tells the compiler which of the <small>INPUT</small> and
<small>OUTPUT</small> code fragments should be used to map a
given C type to a Perl value. The section labels
<tt>&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt> must begin in the first column
on a line by themselves, and must be in uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each type of
section can appear an arbitrary number of times and does not
have to appear at all. For example, a typemap may commonly
lack <tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt> sections if all it needs to do
is associate additional C types with core <small>XS</small>
types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that start with a hash
<tt>&quot;#&quot;</tt> are considered comments and ignored
in the <tt>&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</tt> section, but are
considered significant in <tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt>. Blank lines are generally
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Traditionally,
typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
conventionally called <tt>&quot;typemap&quot;</tt> in a
<small>CPAN</small> distribution. With ExtUtils::ParseXS
(the <small>XS</small> compiler) version 3.12 or better
which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded
directly into <small>XS</small> code using a HERE-doc like
syntax:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  TYPEMAP: &lt;&lt;HERE
  ...
  HERE</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<tt>&quot;HERE&quot;</tt> can be replaced by other
identifiers like with normal Perl HERE-docs. All details
below about the typemap textual format remain valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</tt> section should contain one pair
of C type and <small>XS</small> type per line as follows. An
example from the core typemap file:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  TYPEMAP
  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
  char *          T_PV
  const char *    T_PV
  unsigned char * T_PV
  ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt>
sections have identical formats, that is, each unindented
line starts a new in&minus; or output map respectively. A
new in&minus; or output map must start with the name of the
<small>XS</small> type to map on a line by itself, followed
by the code that implements it indented on the following
lines. Example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
  T_PTR
    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll get
to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a
little bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
here&rsquo;s an example of the full typemap file for mapping
C strings of the <tt>&quot;char *&quot;</tt> type to Perl
scalars/strings:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  TYPEMAP
  char *  T_PV
  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
  OUTPUT
  T_PV
    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
<tt>&quot;struct netconfig&quot;</tt> to be blessed into the
class <tt>&quot;Net::Config&quot;</tt>. One way to do this
is to use underscores (_) to separate package names, as
follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then
provide a typemap entry
<tt>&quot;T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL&quot;</tt> that maps underscores
to double-colons (::), and declare
<tt>&quot;Net_Config&quot;</tt> to be of that type:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  TYPEMAP
  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
  INPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)){
      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
    }
    else
      croak(\&quot;$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)
  OUTPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    sv_setref_pv($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;,
                 (void*)$var);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>INPUT</small> and <small>OUTPUT</small> sections
substitute underscores for double-colons on the fly, giving
the desired effect. This example demonstrates some of the
power and versatility of the typemap facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;INT2PTR&quot;</tt> macro (defined in perl.h) casts
an integer to a pointer of a given type, taking care of the
possible different size of integers and pointers. There are
also <tt>&quot;PTR2IV&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;PTR2UV&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;PTR2NV&quot;</tt>
macros, to map the other way, which may be useful in
<small>OUTPUT</small> sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Role of
the typemap File in Your Distribution</b> <br>
The default typemap in the <i>lib/ExtUtils</i> directory of
the Perl source contains many useful types which can be used
by Perl extensions. Some extensions define additional
typemaps which they keep in their own directory. These
additional typemaps may reference <small>INPUT</small> and
<small>OUTPUT</small> maps in the main typemap. The
<b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension&rsquo;s own
typemap to override any mappings which are in the default
typemap. Instead of using an additional <i>typemap</i> file,
typemaps may be embedded verbatim in <small>XS</small> with
a heredoc-like syntax. See the documentation on the
<tt>&quot;TYPEMAP:&quot;</tt> <small>XS</small> keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<small>CPAN</small> distributions, you can assume that the
<small>XS</small> types defined by the perl core are already
available. Additionally, the core typemap has default
<small>XS</small> types for a large number of C types. For
example, if you simply return a <tt>&quot;char *&quot;</tt>
from your <small>XSUB</small> , the core typemap will have
this C type associated with the T_PV <small>XS</small> type.
That means your C string will be copied into the
<small>PV</small> (pointer value) slot of a new scalar that
will be returned from your <small>XSUB</small> to to
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
developing a <small>CPAN</small> distribution using
<small>XS</small> , you may add your own file called
<i>typemap</i> to the distribution. That file may contain
typemaps that either map types that are specific to your
code or that override the core typemap file&rsquo;s mappings
for common C types.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sharing
typemaps Between <small>CPAN</small> Distributions</b> <br>
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with
perl 5.16 and better), it is rather easy to share typemap
code between multiple <small>CPAN</small> distributions. The
general idea is to share it as a module that offers a
certain <small>API</small> and have the dependent modules
declare that as a built-time requirement and import the
typemap into the <small>XS</small> . An example of such a
typemap-sharing module on <small>CPAN</small> is
<tt>&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;</tt>. Two steps to
getting that module&rsquo;s typemaps available in your
code:</p>

<p>Declare <tt>&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;</tt>
as a build-time dependency in

<tt>&quot;BUILD_REQUIRES&quot;</tt>), or in your
<tt>&quot;Build.PL&quot;</tt> (use

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Writing
typemap Entries</b> <br>
Each <small>INPUT</small> or <small>OUTPUT</small> typemap
entry is a double-quoted Perl string that will be evaluated
in the presence of certain variables to get the final C code
for mapping a certain C type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as <tt>&quot;${ perl code that evaluates to
scalar reference here }&quot;</tt>. A common use case is to
generate error messages that refer to the true function name
even when using the <small>ALIAS XS</small> feature:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  ${ $ALIAS ? \q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \qq[\&quot;$pname\&quot;] }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For many
typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be
found in the perl source tree at
<i>lib/ExtUtils/typemap</i>.</p>

variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Full Listing
of Core Typemaps</b> <br>
Each C type is represented by an entry in the typemap file
that is responsible for converting perl variables (
<small>SV</small> , <small>AV</small> , <small>HV</small> ,
<small>CV</small> , etc.) to and from that type. The
following sections list all <small>XS</small> types that
come with perl by default. <br>
T_SV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This simply passes the C
representation of the Perl variable (an SV*) in and out of
the <small>XS</small> layer. This can be used if the C code
wants to deal directly with the Perl variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_SVREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used to pass in and return a
reference to an <small>SV</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning the reference to an SV*. See also:
T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_SVREF_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used to pass in and return a
reference to an <small>SV</small> . This is a fixed variant
of T_SVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately when
returning a reference to an SV*. Introduced in perl
5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_AVREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl array. From the C level this is a
pointer to an <small>AV</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an AV*. See also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl array. From the C level this is a
pointer to an <small>AV</small> . This is a fixed variant of
T_AVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately when
returning an AV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_HVREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl hash. From the C level this is a pointer
to an <small>HV</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl hash. From the C level this is a pointer
to an <small>HV</small> . This is a fixed variant of T_HVREF
that decrements the refcount appropriately when returning an
HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_CVREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl subroutine (e.g. <tt>$sub</tt> = sub { 1
};). From the C level this is a pointer to a
<small>CV</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl subroutine (e.g. <tt>$sub</tt> = sub { 1
};). From the C level this is a pointer to a

variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount
appropriately when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl
5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_SYSRET</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The T_SYSRET typemap is used to
process return values from system calls. It is only
meaningful when passing values from C to perl (there is no
concept of passing a system return value from Perl to
C).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">System calls
return &minus;1 on error (setting <small>ERRNO</small> with
the reason) and (usually) 0 on success. If the return value
is &minus;1 this typemap returns <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>.
If the return value is not &minus;1, this typemap translates
a 0 (perl false) to &quot;0 but true&quot; (which is perl
true) or returns the value itself, to indicate that the
command succeeded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>POSIX</small> module makes extensive use of this
type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_UV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unsigned integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_IV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A signed integer. This is cast
to the required integer type when passed to C and converted
to an <small>IV</small> when passed back to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_INT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A signed integer. This typemap
converts the Perl value to a native integer type (the
<tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt> type on the current platform). When
returning the value to perl it is processed in the same way
as for T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Its behaviour
is identical to using an <tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt> type in
<small>XS</small> with T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_ENUM</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An enum value. Used to transfer
an enum component from C. There is no reason to pass an enum
value to C since it is stored as an <small>IV</small> inside
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_BOOL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A boolean type. This can be
used to pass true and false values to and from C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_U_INT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is for unsigned integers.
It is equivalent to using T_UV but explicitly casts the
variable to type <tt>&quot;unsigned int&quot;</tt>. The
default type for <tt>&quot;unsigned int&quot;</tt> is
T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_SHORT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Short integers. This is
equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts the return to type
<tt>&quot;short&quot;</tt>. The default typemap for
<tt>&quot;short&quot;</tt> is T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_U_SHORT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unsigned short integers. This
is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly casts the return to
type <tt>&quot;unsigned short&quot;</tt>. The default
typemap for <tt>&quot;unsigned short&quot;</tt> is T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">T_U_SHORT is
used for type <tt>&quot;U16&quot;</tt> in the standard
typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_LONG</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Long integers. This is
equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts the return to type
<tt>&quot;long&quot;</tt>. The default typemap for
<tt>&quot;long&quot;</tt> is T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_U_LONG</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unsigned long integers. This is
equivalent to T_UV but explicitly casts the return to type
<tt>&quot;unsigned long&quot;</tt>. The default typemap for
<tt>&quot;unsigned long&quot;</tt> is T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">T_U_LONG is
used for type <tt>&quot;U32&quot;</tt> in the standard
typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_CHAR</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Single 8&minus;bit
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_U_CHAR</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unsigned byte.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_FLOAT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A floating point number. This
typemap guarantees to return a variable cast to a
<tt>&quot;float&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_NV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Perl floating point number.
Similar to T_IV and T_UV in that the return type is cast to
the requested numeric type rather than to a specific
type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_DOUBLE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A double precision floating
point number. This typemap guarantees to return a variable
cast to a <tt>&quot;double&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A string (char *).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PTR</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A memory address (pointer).
Typically associated with a <tt>&quot;void *&quot;</tt>
type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PTRREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to T_PTR except that
the pointer is stored in a scalar and the reference to that
scalar is returned to the caller. This can be used to hide
the actual pointer value from the programmer since it is
usually not required directly from within perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The typemap
checks that a scalar reference is passed from perl to
<small>XS</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PTROBJ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to T_PTRREF except that
the reference is blessed into a class. This allows the
pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to deal
with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object
passed into the <small>XS</small> routine is of the correct
class (or part of a subclass).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The pointer is
blessed into a class that is derived from the name of type
of the pointer but with all &rsquo;*&rsquo; in the name
replaced with &rsquo;Ptr&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_REF_IV_REF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOT YET</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_REF_IV_PTR</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the
pointer is blessed into a scalar object. The difference is
that when the object is passed back into <small>XS</small>
it must be of the correct type (inheritance is not
supported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The pointer is
blessed into a class that is derived from the name of type
of the pointer but with all &rsquo;*&rsquo; in the name
replaced with &rsquo;Ptr&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PTRDESC</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOT YET</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_REFREF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to T_PTRREF, except the
pointer stored in the referenced scalar is dereferenced and
copied to the output variable. This means that T_REFREF is
to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Only the
<small>INPUT</small> part of this is implemented (Perl to
<small>XSUB</small> ) and there are no known users in core
or on <small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_REFOBJ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOT YET</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_OPAQUEPTR</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can be used to store bytes
in the string component of the <small>SV</small> . Here the
representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the
bytes themselves are just stored in the <small>SV</small> .
It is assumed that the C variable is a pointer (the bytes
are copied from that memory location). If the pointer is
pointing to something that is represented by 8 bytes then
those 8 bytes are stored in the <small>SV</small> (and
<i>length()</i> will report a value of 8). This entry is
similar to T_OPAQUE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In principle
the <i>unpack()</i> command can be used to convert the bytes
back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a
number).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This entry can
be used to store a C structure (the number of bytes to be
copied is calculated using the C <tt>&quot;sizeof&quot;</tt>
function) and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF
without having to worry about a memory leak (since Perl will
clean up the <small>SV</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_OPAQUE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can be used to store data
from non-pointer types in the string part of an
<small>SV</small> . It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that
the typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather than
assuming it is being supplied. For example, if an integer is
imported into Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the
underlying bytes representing the integer will be stored in
the <small>SV</small> but the actual integer value will not
be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The data may be
retrieved using the <tt>&quot;unpack&quot;</tt> function if
the underlying type of the byte stream is known.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">T_OPAQUE
supports input and output of simple types. T_OPAQUEPTR can
be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer is
acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Implicit array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">xsubpp supports a special
syntax for returning packed C arrays to perl. If the
<small>XS</small> return type is given as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  array(type, nelem)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">xsubpp will
copy the contents of <tt>&quot;nelem *
sizeof(type)&quot;</tt> bytes from <small>RETVAL</small> to
an <small>SV</small> and push it onto the stack. This is
only really useful if the number of items to be returned is
known at compile time and you don&rsquo;t mind having a
string of bytes in your <small>SV</small> . Use T_ARRAY to
push a variable number of arguments onto the return stack
(they won&rsquo;t be packed as a single string though).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is similar
to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more than
one element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PACKED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Calls user-supplied functions
for conversion. For <tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt> (
<small>XSUB</small> to Perl), a function named
<tt>&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot;</tt> is called with the
output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from.
<tt>$ntype</tt> is the normalized C type that is to be
mapped to Perl. Normalized means that all
<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> are replaced by the string
<tt>&quot;Ptr&quot;</tt>. The return value of the function
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely for
<tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt> (Perl to <small>XSUB</small> )
mapping, the function named
<tt>&quot;XS_unpack_$ntype&quot;</tt> is called with the
input Perl scalar as argument and the return value is cast
to the mapped C type and assigned to the output C
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An example
conversion function for a typemapped struct <tt>&quot;foo_t
*&quot;</tt> might be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
  {
    dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */
    HV* hash = newHV();
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;int_member&quot;, newSViv(in&minus;&gt;int_member));
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;float_member&quot;, newSVnv(in&minus;&gt;float_member));
    /* ... */
    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The conversion
from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader, but the
prototype would be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  static foo_t *
  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of an
actual C function that has to fetch the thread context using
<tt>&quot;dTHX&quot;</tt>, you can define macros of the same
name and avoid the overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly
free the memory allocated by
<tt>&quot;XS_unpack_foo_tPtr&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_PACKEDARRAY</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to
T_PACKED. In fact, the <tt>&quot;INPUT&quot;</tt> (Perl to
<small>XSUB</small> ) typemap is indentical, but the
<tt>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</tt> typemap passes an additional
argument to the <tt>&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot;</tt>
function. This third parameter indicates the number of
elements in the output so that the function can handle C
arrays sanely. The variable needs to be declared by the user
and must have the name <tt>&quot;count_$ntype&quot;</tt>
where <tt>$ntype</tt> is the normalized C type name as
explained above. The signature of the function would be for
the example above and <tt>&quot;foo_t **&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The type of the
third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap is
concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Of course,
unless you know the number of elements in the
<tt>&quot;sometype **&quot;</tt> C array, within your
<small>XSUB</small> , the return value from <tt>&quot;foo_t
** XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)&quot;</tt> will be hard to
decypher. Since the details are all up to the
<small>XS</small> author (the typemap user), there are
several solutions, none of which particularly elegant. The
most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for
N+1 pointers and assign <tt>&quot;NULL&quot;</tt> to the
(N+1)th to facilitate iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
using a customized typemap for your purposes in the first
place is probably preferrable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_DATAUNIT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOT YET</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_CALLBACK</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOT YET</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_ARRAY</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used to convert the
perl argument list to a C array and for pushing the contents
of a C array onto the perl argument stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The usual
calling signature is</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  @out = array_func( @in );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
arguments can occur in the list before the array but the
input and output arrays must be the last elements in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used to
pass a perl list to C the <small>XS</small> writer must
provide a function (named after the array type but with
&rsquo;Ptr&rsquo; substituted for &rsquo;*&rsquo;) to
allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer
should be returned. It is up to the <small>XS</small> writer
to free the memory on exit from the function. The variable
<tt>&quot;ix_$var&quot;</tt> is set to the number of
elements in the new array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When returning
a C array to Perl the <small>XS</small> writer must provide
an integer variable called <tt>&quot;size_$var&quot;</tt>
containing the number of elements in the array. This is used
to determine how many elements should be pushed onto the
return argument stack. This is not required on input since
Perl knows how many arguments are on the stack when the
routine is called. Ordinarily this variable would be called
<tt>&quot;size_RETVAL&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
the type of each element is determined from the type of the
array. If the array uses type <tt>&quot;intArray
*&quot;</tt> xsubpp will automatically work out that it
contains variables of type <tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt> and use
that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element. All
pointer &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;Array&rsquo; tags are
removed from the name to determine the subtype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_STDIO</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used for passing perl
filehandles to and from C using <tt>&quot;FILE *&quot;</tt>
structures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_INOUT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used for passing perl
filehandles to and from C using <tt>&quot;PerlIO
*&quot;</tt> structures. The file handle can used for
reading and writing. This corresponds to the
<tt>&quot;+&lt;&quot;</tt> mode, see also T_IN and
T_OUT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See perliol for
more information on the Perl <small>IO</small> abstraction
layer. Perl must have been built with
<tt>&quot;&minus;Duseperlio&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
check to assert that the filehandle passed from Perl to C
was created with the right <tt>&quot;open()&quot;</tt>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Hint: The
perlxstut tutorial covers the T_INOUT, T_IN, and T_OUT
<small>XS</small> types nicely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_IN</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as T_INOUT, but the
filehandle that is returned from C to Perl can only be used
for reading (mode <tt>&quot;&lt;&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">T_OUT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as T_INOUT, but the
filehandle that is returned from C to Perl is set to use the
open mode <tt>&quot;+&gt;&quot;</tt>.</p>
