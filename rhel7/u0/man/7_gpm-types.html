<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gpm-types
&minus; pointer types (mice, tablets, etc.) managed by gpm.
<br>
The information below is extracted from the texinfo file,
which is the preferred source of information.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manpage
describes the various pointer types currently available in
gpm. If you look at the source code, you&rsquo;ll find that
pointer-specific code is confined to mice.c (while it used
to only include mouse decoders, gpm now supports tablets and
touchscreens as well).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mouse type
is specified on command line with the &minus;t option. The
option takes an argument, which represents the name of a
mouse type. Each type can be associated to different names.
For old mouse types, one name is the old
selection-compatible name, and another is the XFree name.
After version 1.18.1 of gpm, the number of synonyms was made
arbitrary and the actual name being used is made available
to the function responsible for mouse initialization.
Therefore it is possible for a mouse decoder to behave
slightly differently according to the name being used for
the device (if this feature was already present, we
wouldn&rsquo;t have for example ms+ and ms+lr as different
mouse types).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
initialization procedure of each mouse type can also receive
extra option, by means of the &minus;o command line option.
Since interpretation of the option string is
decoder-specific, the allowed options are described in
association to each mouse type. When no description of
option strings is provided, that means the option string is
unused for that mouse type and specifying one generates an
error. When the document refer to &lsquo;&lsquo;standard
serial options&rsquo;&rsquo; it means that one of &minus;o
dtr, &minus;o rts, &minus;o both can be specified to toggle
the control lines of the serial port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
mouse type are currently recognized: <br>
bare Microsoft</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The Microsoft protocol, without
any extension. It only reports two buttons. If your device
has three, you should either try running the mman decoder or
msc. In the latter case, you need to tell the mouse to talk
msc protocol by toggling the DTR and RTS lines (with one of
&minus;o drt, &minus;o rts or &minus;o both) or invoking gpm
&minus;t msc while keeping the middle button pressed. Very
annoying, indeed. This mouse decoder accepts standard serial
options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>ms</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the original Microsoft protocol, with a
middle-button extension. Some old two-button devices send
some spurious packets which can be misunderstood as
middle-button events. If this is your case, use the bare
mouse type. Some new two-button devices are
&lsquo;&lsquo;plug and play&rsquo;&rsquo;, and they
don&rsquo;t play fair at all; in this case try &minus;t pnp.
Many (most) three-button devices that use the Microsoft
protocol fail to report some middle-button events during
mouse motion. Since the protocol does not distinguish
between the middle button going up and the middle button
going down it would be liable to get out of step, so this
decoder declares the middle button to be up whenever the
mouse moves. This prevents dragging with the middle button,
so you should probably use &minus;t ms+lr instead of this
decoder, especially if you want to use X. This mouse decoder
accepts standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>ms+</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the same as &minus;t ms except that the middle
button is not reset during mouse motion. So you can drag
with the middle button. However, if your mouse exhibits the
usual buggy behaviour the decoder is likely to get out of
step with reality, thinking the middle button is up when
it&rsquo;s down and vice versa. You should probably use
&minus;t ms+lr instead of this decoder. This mouse decoder
accepts standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>ms+lr</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the same as &minus;t ms+ except that there is an
additional facility to reset the state of the middle button
by pressing the other two buttons together. Do this when the
decoder gets into a confused state where it thinks the
middle button is up when it&rsquo;s down and vice versa. (If
you get sick of having to do this, please don&rsquo;t blame
gpm; blame your buggy mouse! Note that most three-button
mice that do the Microsoft protocol can be made to do the
MouseSystems protocol instead. The &lsquo;&lsquo;3 Button
Serial Mouse mini-HOWTO&rsquo;&rsquo; has information about
this.) This mouse decoder accepts standard serial options,
although they should not be needed.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">msc MouseSystems</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the standard protocol
for three-button serial devices. Some of such devices only
enter MouseSystem mode if the RTS, DTR or both lines are
pushed low. Thus, you may try &minus;t msc associated with
&minus;o rts, &minus;o dtr or &minus;o both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mman Mouseman</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The protocol used by the new
Logitech devices with three buttons. It is backward
compatible with the Microsoft protocol, so if your mouse has
three buttons and works with &minus;t ms or similar decoders
you may try &minus;t mman instead to use the middle button.
This mouse decoder accepts standard serial options, although
they should not be needed.</p>

protocol is hardwired at 1200 baud and is upset by normal

back to this documentation the content of that file. The
decoder accepts the following options: smooth=, debounce=.
An higher smoothness results in slower motion as well; a
smaller smoothness gives faster motion but, obviously, less
smooth. The default smoothness is 9. The debounce time is
express in milliseconds and is the minimum duration of an
up-down event to be taken as a tap. Smaller bounces are
ignored.</p> </td></tr>
