&minus; How to get help if you have problems with MRTG</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>MRTG</small>
seems to raise a lot of questions. There are a number of
resources apart from the documentation where you can find
help for mrtg.</p>

<h2>FAQ
<a name="FAQ"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
following sections you&rsquo;ll find some additonal
Frequently Asked Questions, with Answers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why is there
no &quot;@#$%&quot; (my native language) version of
<small>MRTG</small> ?</b> <br>
Nobody has contributed a <i>@#$%.pmd</i> file yet. Go into
the <i>mrtg&minus;2.17.4/translate</i> directory and create
your own translation file. When you are happy with it send
it to me for inclusion with the next mrtg release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I need a
script to make mrtg work with my xyz device.</b> <br>
Probably this has already been done. Check the stuff in the
<i>mrtg&minus;2.17.4/contrib</i> directory. There is a file
called <i>00INDEX</i> in that directory which tells what you
can find in there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does
this <small>SNMP</small> thing work</b> <br>
There are many resources on the net that explain
<small>SNMP</small> . Take a look at this article from the
Linux Journal by David Guerrero</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> http://www.david&minus;guerrero.com/papers/snmp/</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And at this
rather long document from <small>CISCO</small> .</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/snmp.htm</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The images
created by <small>MRTG</small> look very strange.</b> <br>
Remove the *&minus;{week,day,month,year}.png files and start
<small>MRTG</small> again. Using <small>MRTG</small> for the
first time, you might have to do this twice. This will also
help when you introduce new routers into the cfg file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is my
Community Name?</b> <br>
Ask the person in charge of your Router or try
&rsquo;public&rsquo;, as this is the default Community
Name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>My graphs
show a flat line during an outage. Why ?</b> <br>
Well, the short answer is that when an <small>SNMP</small>
query goes out and a response doesn&rsquo;t come back,
<small>MRTG</small> has to assume something to put in the
graph, and by default it assumes that the last answer we got
back is probably closer to the truth than zero. This
assumption is not perfect (as you have noticed). It&rsquo;s
a trade-off that happens to fail during a total outage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this is an
unacceptable trade-off, use the <b>unknaszero</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may want to
know what you&rsquo;re trading off, so in the spirit of
trade-offs, here&rsquo;s the long answer:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problem is
that <small>MRTG</small> doesn&rsquo;t know *why* the data
didn&rsquo;t come back, all it knows is that it didn&rsquo;t
come back. It has to do something, and it assumes it&rsquo;s
a stray lost packet rather than an outage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why don&rsquo;t
we always assume the circuit is down and use zero, which
will (we think) be more nearly right? Well, it turns out
that you may be taking advantage of <small>MRTG</small>
&rsquo;s &quot;assume last&quot; behaviour without being
aware of it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>MRTG</small>
uses <small>SNMP</small> (Simple Network Management
Protocol) to collect data, and <small>SNMP</small> uses
<small>UDP</small> (User Datagram Protocol) to ship packets
around. <small>UDP</small> is connectionless (not
guaranteed) unlike <small>TCP</small> where packets are
tracked and acknowledged and, if needed, retransmitted.
<small>UDP</small> just throws packets at the network and
hopes they arrive. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One likely
cause of lost <small>SNMP</small> data is congestion;
another is busy routers. Other possibilities include
transient telecommunications problems, router buffer
overflows (which may or may not be congestion-related),
&quot;dirty lines&quot; (links with high error rates), and
acts of God. These things happen all the time; we just
don&rsquo;t notice because many interactive services are
TCP-based and the lost packets get retransmitted
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the above
cases where some <small>SNMP</small> packets are lost but
traffic is flowing, assuming zero is the wrong thing to do
&minus; you end up with a graph that looks like it&rsquo;s
missing teeth whenever the link fills up.
<small>MRTG</small> interpolates the lost data to produce a
smoother graph which is more accurate in cases of
intermittent packet loss. But with V2.8.4 and above, you can
use the &quot;unknaszero&quot; option to produce whichever
graph is best under the conditions typical for your
network.</p>
