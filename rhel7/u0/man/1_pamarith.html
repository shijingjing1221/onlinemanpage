<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
reads two PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM images as input. It performs
the specified binary arithmetic operation on their sample
values and produces an output of a format which is the more
general of the two input formats. The two input images must
be of the same width and height. The arithmetic is performed
on each pair of identically located tuples to generate the
identically located tuple of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of the calculation, it assumes any PBM, PGM, or PPM input
image is the equivalent PAM image of tuple type
<b>BLACKANDWHITE</b>, <b>GRAYSCALE</b>, or <b>RGB</b>,
respectively, and if it produces a PBM, PGM, or PPM output,
produces the equivalent of the PAM image which is the result
of the calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
<i>pamfile</i> argument identifies the &rsquo;left&rsquo;
argument image; the second <i>pamfile</i> argument
identifies the &rsquo;right&rsquo; one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the output
is PAM, the tuple type is the same as the tuple type of the
left input image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
performs the arithmetic on each pair of identically located
tuples in the two input images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The arithmetic
operation is in all cases fundamentally a function from two
integers to an integer. The operation is performed on two
tuples as follows. The two input images must have the same
depth, or one of them must have depth one. <b>pamarith</b>
fails if one of these is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If they have
the same depth, <b>pamarith</b> simply carries out the
arithmetic one sample at a time. I.e. if at a particular
position the left input image contains the tuple
(s1,s2,...,sN) and the right input image contains the tuple
(t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the output image
contains the tuple (f(s1,t1),f(s2,t2),...,f(sN,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one of the
images has depth 1, the arithmetic is performed between the
one sample in that image and each of the samples in the
other. I.e. if at a particular position the left input image
contains the tuple (s) and the right input image contains
the tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the
output image contains the tuple
(f(s,t1),f(s,t2),...,f(s,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Maxval</b>
<br>
The meanings of the samples with respect to the maxval
varies according to the function you select.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In PAM images
in general, the most usual meaning of a sample (the one that
applies when a PAM image represents a visual image), is that
it represents a fraction of some maximum. The maxval of the
image corresponds to some maximum value (in the case of a
visual image, it corresponds to &rsquo;full
intensity.&rsquo;), and a sample value divided by the maxval
gives the fraction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>pamarith</b>, this interpretation applies to the regular
arithmetic functions: <b>-add</b>, <b>-subtract</b>,
<b>-multiply</b>, <b>-divide</b>, <b>-difference</b>,
<b>-minimum</b>, <b>-maximum</b>, <b>-mean</b>, and
<b>-compare</b>. For those, you should think of the
arguments and result as numbers in the range [0,1). For
example, if the maxval of the left argument image is 100 and
the maxval of the right argument image is 200 and the maxval
of the output image is 200, and the left sample value in an
<b>-add</b> calculation is 50 and the right sample is 60,
the actual calculation is 50/100 + 60/200 = 160/200, and the
output sample value is 160.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these
functions, <b>pamarith</b> makes the output image&rsquo;s
maxval the maximum of the two input maxvals, except with
<b>-compare</b>, where <b>pamarith</b> uses an output maxval
of 2. (Before Netpbm 10.14 (February 2003), there was no
exception for <b>-compare</b>; in 10.14, the exception was
just that the maxval was <i>at least</i> 2, and sometime
between 10.18 and 10.26 (January 2005), it changed to being
exactly 2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the result
of a calculation falls outside the range [0, 1),
<b>pamarith</b> clips it -- i.e. considers it to be zero or
1-.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In many cases,
where both your input maxvals are the same, you can just
think of the operation as taking place between the sample
values directly, with no consideration of the maxval except
for the clipping. E.g. an <b>-add</b> of sample value 5 to
sample value 8 yields sample value 13.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But with
<b>-multiply</b>, this doesn&rsquo;t work. Say your two
input images have maxval 255, which means the output image
also has maxval 255. Consider a location in the image where
the input sample values are 5 and 10. You might think the
multiplicative product of those would yield 50 in the
output. But <b>pamarith</b> carries out the arithmetic on
the fractions 5/255 and 10/255. It multiplies those together
and then rescales to the output maxval, giving a sample
value in the output PAM of 50/255 rounded to the nearest
integer: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the bit
string operations, the maxval has a whole different meaning.
The operations in question are: <b>-and</b>, <b>-or</b>,
<b>-nand</b>, <b>-nor</b>, <b>-xor</b>, and
<b>-shiftleft</b>, <b>-shiftright</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With these,
each sample value in one or both input images, and in the
output image, represents a bit string, not a number. The
maxval tells how wide the bit string is. The maxval must be
a full binary count (a power of two minus one, such as 0xff)
and the number of ones in it is the width of the bit string.
For the dyadic bit string operations (that&rsquo;s
everything but the shift functions), the maxvals of the
input images must be the same and <b>pamarith</b> makes the
maxval of the output image the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the bit
shift operations, the output maxval is the same as the left
input maxval. The right input image (which contains the
shift counts) can have any maxval and the maxval is
irrelevant to the interpretation of the samples. The sample
value is the actual shift count. But it&rsquo;s still
required that no sample value exceed the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Operations</b> <br>
Most of the operations are obvious from the option name. The
following paragraphs cover those that aren&rsquo;t.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-subtract</b>
subtracts a value in the right input image from a value in
the left input image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-difference</b>
calculates the absolute value of the difference.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-multiply</b>
does an ordinary arithmetic multiplication, but tends to
produce nonobvious results because of the way
<b>pamarith</b> interprets sample values. See
<a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-divide</b>
divides a value in the left input image by the value in the
left input image. But like <b>-multiply</b>, it tends to
produce nonobvious results. Note that <b>pamarith</b>
clipping behavior makes this of little use when the left
argument (dividend) is greater than the right argument
(divisor) -- the result in that case is always the maxval.
If the divisor is 0, the result is the maxval. This option
was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-compare</b>
produces the value <b>0</b> when the value in the left input
image is less than the value in the right input image,
<b>1</b> when the values are equal, and <b>2</b> when the
left is greater than the right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the maxvals
of the input images are not identical, <b>pamarith</b> may
claim two values are not equal when in fact they are, due to
the precision with which it does the arithmetic. However, it
will never say A is greater than B if A is less than B.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-compare</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-and</b>,
<b>-nand</b>, <b>-or</b>, <b>-nor</b>, and <b>-xor</b>
consider the input and output images to contain bit strings;
they compute bitwise logic operations. Note that if the
maxval is 1, you can also look at these as logic operations
on boolean input values. See section
<a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> for the special meaning of
maxval with respect to bit string operations such as
these.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-shiftleft</b>
and <b>-shiftright</b> consider the left input image and
output image to contain bit strings. They compute a bit
shift operation, with bits falling off the left or right end
and zeroes shifting in, as opposed to bits off one end to
the other. The right input image sample value is the number
of bit positions to shift.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
maxval (see <a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> ) determines the
width of the frame within which you are shifting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Notes</b>
<br>
If you want to apply a unary function, e.g.
&quot;halve&quot;, to a single image, use
<b>pamfunc</b>.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
replaced <b>pnmarith</b> in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm 10.3
through 10.8, though, <b>pamarith</b> was not backward
compatible because it required the input images to be of the
same depth, so you could not multiply a PBM by a PPM as is
often done for masking. (It was not intended at the time
that <b>pnmarith</b> would be removed from Netpbm -- the
plan was just to rewrite it to use <b>pamarith</b>; it was
removed by mistake).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But starting
with Netpbm 10.9 (September 2002), <b>pamarith</b> allows
the images to have different depths as long as one of them
has depth 1, and that made it backward compatible with
<b>pnmarith</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
<b>pnmarith</b> did not have the <b>-mean</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-compare</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.13 (December
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The bit string
operations were added in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-divide</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>
