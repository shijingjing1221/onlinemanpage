<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mailcap -
metamail capabilities file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mailcap</i> file is read by the <i>metamail</i> program
to determine how to display non-text at the local site.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of a
mailcap file is quite simple, at least compared to termcap
files. Any line that starts with &quot;#&quot; is a comment.
Blank lines are ignored. Otherwise, each line defines a
single mailcap entry for a single content type. Long lines
may be continued by ending them with a backslash character,
\.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each individual
mailcap entry consists of a content-type specification, a
command to execute, and (possibly) a set of optional
&quot;flag&quot; values. For example, a very simple mailcap
entry (which is actually a built-in default behavior for
metamail) would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">text/plain; cat
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
flags can be used to specify additional information about
the mail-handling command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">text/plain; cat
%s; copiousoutput</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">can be used to
indicate that the output of the &rsquo;cat&rsquo; command
may be voluminous, requiring either a scrolling window, a
pager, or some other appropriate coping mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;type&quot; field (text/plain, in the above example) is
simply any legal content type name, as defined by RFC 822.
In practice, this is almost any string. It is the string
that will be matched against the &quot;Content-type&quot;
header (or the value passed in with -c) to decide if this is
the mailcap entry that matches the current message.
Additionally, the type field may specify a subtype (e.g.
&quot;text/ISO-8859-1&quot;) or a wildcard to match all
subtypes (e.g. &quot;image/*&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;command&quot; field is any UNIX command (&quot;cat
%s&quot; in the above example), and is used to specify the
interpreter for the given type of message. It will be passed
to the shell via the system(3) facility. Semicolons and
backslashes within the command must be quoted with
backslashes. If the command contains &quot;%s&quot;, those
two characters will be replaced by the name of a file that
contains the body of the message. If it contains
&quot;%t&rsquo;, those two characters will be replaced by
the content-type field, including the subtype, if any. (That
is, if the content-type was &quot;image/pbm;
opt1=something-else&quot;, then &quot;%t&quot; would be
replaced by &quot;image/pbm&quot;.) If the command field
contains &quot;%{&quot; followed by a parameter name and a
closing &quot;}&quot;, then all those characters will be
replaced by the value of the named parameter, if any, from
the Content-type header. Thus, in the previous example,
&quot;%{opt1}&quot; will be replaced by
&quot;something-else&quot;. Finally, if the command contains
&quot;\%&quot;, those two characters will be replaced by a
single % character. (In fact, the backslash can be used to
quote any character, including itself.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&quot;%s&quot; appears in the command field, then instead of
placing the message body in a temporary file, metamail will
pass the body to the command on the standard input. This is
helpful in saving /tmp file space, but can be problematic
for window-oriented applications under some window systems
such as MGR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two special
codes can appear in the viewing command for objects of type
multipart (any subtype). These are &quot;%n&quot; and
&quot;%F&quot;. %n will be replaced by the number of parts
within the multipart object. %F will be replaced by a series
of arguments, two for each part, giving first the
content-type and then the name of the temporary file where
the decoded part has been stored. In addition, for each file
created by %F, a second file is created, with the same name
followed by &quot;H&quot;, which contains the header
information for that body part. This will not be needed by
most multipart handlers, but it is there if you ever need
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;notes=xxx&quot; field is an uninterpreted string that
is used to specify the name of the person who installed this
entry in the mailcap file. (The &quot;xxx&quot; may be
replaced by any text string.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;test=xxx&quot; field is a command that is executed to
determine whether or not the mailcap line actually applies.
That is, if the content-type field matches the content-type
on the message, but a &quot;test=&quot; field is present,
then the test must succeed before the mailcap line is
considered to &quot;match&quot; the message being viewed.
The command may be any UNIX command, using the same syntax
and the same %-escapes as for the viewing command, as
described above. A command is considered to succeed if it
exits with a zero exit status, and to fail otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;print=xxx&quot; field is a command that is executed to
print the data instead of display it interactively. This
behavior is usually a consequence of invoking metamail with
the &quot;-h&quot; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;textualnewlines&quot; field can be used in the rather
obscure case where metamail&rsquo;s default rules for
treating newlines in base64-encoded data are unsatisfactory.
By default, metamail will translate CRLF to the local
newline character in decoded base64 output if the
content-type is &quot;text&quot; (any subtype), but will not
do so otherwise. A mailcap entry with a field of
&quot;textualnewlines=1&quot; will force such translation
for the specified content-type, while
&quot;textualnewlines=0&quot; will guarantee that the
translation does not take place even for textual
content-types.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;compose&quot; field may be used to specify a program
that can be used to compose a new body or body part in the
given format. Its intended use is to support mail composing
agents that support the composition of multiple types of
mail using external composing agents. As with the
view-command, the compose command will be executed after
replacing certain escape sequences starting with
&quot;%&quot;. In particular, %s should be replaced by the
name of a file to which the composed data is to be written
by the specified composing program, thus allowing the
calling program (e.g. metamail) to tell the called program
where to store the composed data. If %s does not appear,
then the composed data will be assumed to be written by the
composing programs to standard output. The result of the
composing program may be data that is NOT yet suitable for
mail transport -- that is, a Content-Transfer-Encoding may
still need to be applied to the data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;composetyped&quot; field is similar to the
&quot;compose&quot; field, but is to be used when the
composing program needs to specify the Content-type header
field to be applied to the composed data. The
&quot;compose&quot; field is simpler, and is preferred for
use with existing (non-mail-oriented) programs for composing
data in a given format. The &quot;composetyped&quot; field
is necessary when the Content-type information must include
auxiliary parameters, and the composition program must then
know enough about mail formats to produce output that
includes the mail type information, and to apply any
necessary Content-Transfer-Encoding. Conceptually,
&quot;compose&quot; specifies a program that simply outputs
the specified type of data in its raw form, while
&quot;composetyped&quot; specifies a program that outputs
the data as a MIME object, with all necessary Content-*
headers already in place. <b><br>
needsterminal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If this flag is given, the
named interpreter needs to interact with the user on a
terminal. In some environments (e.g. a window-oriented mail
reader under X11) this will require the creation of a new
terminal emulation window, while in most environments it
will not. If the mailcap entry specifies
&quot;needsterminal&quot; and metamail is not running on a
terminal (as determined by isatty(3), the -x option, and the
MM_NOTTTY environment variable) then metamail will try to
run the command in a new terminal emulation window.
Currently, metamail knows how to create new windows under
the X11, SunTools, and WM window systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>copiousoutput</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This flag should be given
whenever the interpreter is capable of producing more than a
few lines of output on stdout, and does no interaction with
the user. If the mailcap entry specifies copiousoutput, and
pagination has been requested via the &quot;-p&quot;
command, then the output of the command being executed will
be piped through a pagination program (&quot;more&quot; by
default, but this can be overridden with the METAMAIL_PAGER
environment variable).</p>

<h2>BUILT-IN CONTENT-TYPE SUPPORT
<a name="BUILT-IN CONTENT-TYPE SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The metamail
program has built-in support for a few key content-types. In
particular, it supports the text type, the multipart and
multipart/alternative type, and the message/rfc822 types.
This support is incomplete for many subtypes -- for example,
it only supports US-ASCII text in general. This kind of
built-in support can be OVERRIDDEN by an entry in any
mailcap file on the user&rsquo;s search path. Metamail also
has rudimentary built-in support for types that are totally
unrecognized -- i.e. for which no mailcap entry or built-in
handler exists. For such unrecognized types, metamail will
write a file with a &quot;clean&quot; copy of the data --
i.e. a copy in which all mail headers have been removed, and
in which any 7-bit transport encoding has been decoded.</p>
