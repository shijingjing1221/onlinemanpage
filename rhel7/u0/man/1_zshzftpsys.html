<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zshzftpsys
&minus; zftp function front&minus;end</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This describes
the set of shell functions supplied with the source
distribution as an interface to the <b>zftp</b> builtin
command, allowing you to perform FTP operations from the
shell command line or within functions or scripts. The
interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e.g. the
<b>ftp</b> command itself, see <i>ftp</i>(1)), but as it is
entirely done within the shell all the familiar completion,
editing and globbing features, and so on, are present, and
macros are particularly simple to write as they are just
ordinary shell functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
prerequisite is that the <b>zftp</b> command, as described
in <i>zshmodules</i>(1) , must be available in the version
of <b>zsh</b> installed at your site. If the shell is
configured to load new commands at run time, it probably is:
typing &lsquo;<b>zmodload zsh/zftp</b>&rsquo; will make sure
(if that runs silently, it has worked). If this is not the
case, it is possible <b>zftp</b> was linked into the shell
anyway: to test this, type &lsquo;<b>which zftp</b>&rsquo;
and if <b>zftp</b> is available you will get the message
&lsquo;<b>zftp: shell built&minus;in command</b>&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Commands given
directly with <b>zftp</b> builtin may be interspersed
between the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using
<b>zftp</b> directly may cause some of the status
information stored in shell parameters to become invalid.
Note in particular the description of the variables
<b>$ZFTP_TMOUT</b>, <b>$ZFTP_PREFS</b> and
<b>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</b> for <b>zftp</b>.</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION
<a name="INSTALLATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should make
sure all the functions from the <b>Functions/Zftp</b>
directory of the source distribution are available; they all
begin with the two letters &lsquo;<b>zf</b>&rsquo;. They may
already have been installed on your system; otherwise, you
will need to find them and copy them. The directory should
appear as one of the elements of the <b>$fpath</b> array
(this should already be the case if they were installed),
and at least the function <b>zfinit</b> should be
autoloaded; it will autoload the rest. Finally, to
initialize the use of the system you need to call the
<b>zfinit</b> function. The following code in your
<b>.zshrc</b> will arrange for this; assume the functions
are stored in the directory <b>~/myfns</b>:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fpath=(~/myfns
$fpath) <br>
autoload &minus;U zfinit <br>
zfinit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>zfinit</b> assumes you are using the <b>zmodload</b>
method to load the <b>zftp</b> command. If it is already
built into the shell, change <b>zfinit</b> to <b>zfinit
&minus;n</b>. It is helpful (though not essential) if the
call to <b>zfinit</b> appears after any code to initialize
the new completion system, else unnecessary <b>compctl</b>
commands will be given.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sequence of
operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the
same as that in a standard FTP client. Note that, due to a
quirk of the shell&rsquo;s <b>getopts</b> builtin, for those
functions that handle options you must use
&lsquo;<b>&minus;&minus;</b>&rsquo; rather than
&lsquo;<b>&minus;</b>&rsquo; to ensure the remaining
arguments are treated literally (a single
&lsquo;<b>&minus;</b>&rsquo; is treated as an argument).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening a
connection <br>
zfparams [</b> <i>host</i> <b>[</b> <i>user</i> <b>[</b>
<i>password</i> <b>... ] ] ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set or show the parameters for
a future <b>zfopen</b> with no arguments. If no arguments
are given, the current parameters are displayed (the
password will be shown as a line of asterisks). If a host is
given, and either the <i>user</i> or <i>password</i> is not,
they will be prompted for; also, any parameter given as
&lsquo;<b>?</b>&rsquo; will be prompted for, and if the
&lsquo;<b>?</b>&rsquo; is followed by a string, that will be
used as the prompt. As <b>zfopen</b> calls <b>zfparams</b>
to store the parameters, this usually need not be called
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A single
argument &lsquo;<b>&minus;</b>&rsquo; will delete the stored
parameters. This will also cause the memory of the last
directory (and so on) on the other host to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfopen [ &minus;1 ] [</b>
<i>host</i> <b>[</b> <i>user</i> <b>[</b> <i>password</i>
<b>[</b> <i>account</i> <b>] ] ] ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>host</i> is present, open
a connection to that host under username <i>user</i> with
password <i>password</i> (and, on the rare occasions when it
is necessary, account <i>account</i>). If a necessary
parameter is missing or given as &lsquo;<b>?</b>&rsquo; it
will be prompted for. If <i>host</i> is not present, use a
previously stored set of parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
was successful, and the terminal is compatible with
<b>xterm</b> or is <b>sun&minus;cmd</b>, a summary will
appear in the title bar, giving the local
<b>host:directory</b> and the remote <b>host:directory</b>;
this is handled by the function <b>zftp_chpwd</b>, described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, the
<i>host</i>, <i>user</i> and <i>password</i> are internally
recorded for later re&minus;opening, either by a
<b>zfopen</b> with no arguments, or automatically (see
below). With the option &lsquo;<b>&minus;1</b>&rsquo;, no
information is stored. Also, if an open command with
arguments failed, the parameters will not be retained (and
any previous parameters will also be deleted). A
<b>zfopen</b> on its own, or a <b>zfopen &minus;1</b>, never
alters the stored parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Both
<b>zfopen</b> and <b>zfanon</b> (but not <b>zfparams</b>)
understand URLs of the form
<b>ftp://</b><i>host</i>/<i>path...</i> as meaning to
connect to the <i>host</i>, then change directory to
<i>path</i> (which must be a directory, not a file). The
&lsquo;<b>ftp://</b>&rsquo; can be omitted; the trailing
&lsquo;<b>/</b>&rsquo; is enough to trigger recognition of
the <i>path</i>. Note prefixes other than
&lsquo;<b>ftp:</b>&rsquo; are not recognized, and that all
characters after the first slash beyond <i>host</i> are
significant in <i>path</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfanon [ &minus;1 ]</b>
<i>host</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open a connection <i>host</i>
for anonymous FTP. The username used is
&lsquo;<b>anonymous</b>&rsquo;. The password (which will be
reported the first time) is generated as
<i>user</i><b>@</b><i>host</i>; this is then stored in the
shell parameter <b>$EMAIL_ADDR</b> which can alternatively
be set manually to a suitable string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Directory
management <br>
zfcd [</b> <i>dir</i> <b>]</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>zfcd &minus;</b></p></td>
<td width="80%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfcd</b> <i>old new</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change the current directory on
the remote server: this is implemented to have many of the
features of the shell builtin <b>cd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
form with <i>dir</i> present, change to the directory
<i>dir</i>. The command &lsquo;<b>zfcd ..</b>&rsquo; is
treated specially, so is guaranteed to work on
non&minus;UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by
<b>zftp</b>). If <i>dir</i> is omitted, has the effect of
&lsquo;<b>zfcd ~</b>&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The second form
changes to the directory previously current.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The third form
attempts to change the current directory by replacing the
first occurrence of the string <i>old</i> with the string
<i>new</i> in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is
expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to
&lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo; is converted back to a
&lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo; before being passed to the remote
machine. This is convenient because of the way expansion is
performed on the command line before <b>zfcd</b> receives a
string. For example, suppose the command is &lsquo;<b>zfcd
~/foo</b>&rsquo;. The shell will expand this to a full path
such as &lsquo;<b>zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo</b>&rsquo;. At
this stage, <b>zfcd</b> recognises the initial path as
corresponding to &lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo; and will send the
directory to the remote host as <b>~/foo</b>, so that the
&lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo; will be expanded by the server to the
correct remote host directory. Other named directories of
the form &lsquo;<b>~name</b>&rsquo; are not treated in this
fashion.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>zfhere</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Change directory on the remote server to the one
corresponding to the current local directory, with special
handling of &lsquo;<b>~</b>&rsquo; as in <b>zfcd</b>. For
example, if the current local directory is <b>~/foo/bar</b>,
then <b>zfhere</b> performs the effect of &lsquo;<b>zfcd
~/foo/bar</b>&rsquo;.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfdir [ &minus;rfd ] [
&minus; ] [</b> <i>dir&minus;options</i> <b>] [</b>
<i>dir</i> <b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produce a long directory
listing. The arguments <i>dir&minus;options</i> and
<i>dir</i> are passed directly to the server and their
effect is implementation dependent, but specifying a
particular remote directory <i>dir</i> is usually possible.
The output is passed through a pager given by the
environment variable <b>$PAGER</b>, or
&lsquo;<b>more</b>&rsquo; if that is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The directory
is usually cached for re&minus;use. In fact, two caches are
maintained. One is for use when there is no
<i>dir&minus;options</i> or <i>dir</i>, i.e. a full listing
of the current remote directory; it is flushed when the
current remote directory changes. The other is kept for
repeated use of <b>zfdir</b> with the same arguments; for
example, repeated use of &lsquo;<b>zfdir /pub/gnu</b>&rsquo;
will only require the directory to be retrieved on the first
call. Alternatively, this cache can be re&minus;viewed with
the <b>&minus;r</b> option. As relative directories will
confuse <b>zfdir</b>, the <b>&minus;f</b> option can be used
to force the cache to be flushed before the directory is
listed. The option <b>&minus;d</b> will delete both caches
without showing a directory listing; it will also delete the
cache of file names in the current remote directory, if
any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfls</b> [
<i>ls&minus;options</i> ] [ <i>dir</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List files on the remote
server. With no arguments, this will produce a simple list
of file names for the current remote directory. Any
arguments are passed directly to the server. No pager and no
caching is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Status
commands <br>
zftype</b> [ <i>type</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With no arguments, show the
type of data to be transferred, usually ASCII or binary.
With an argument, change the type: the types
&lsquo;<b>A</b>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<b>ASCII</b>&rsquo; for
ASCII data and &lsquo;<b>B</b>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<b>BINARY</b>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<b>I</b>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<b>IMAGE</b>&rsquo; for binary data are understood
case&minus;insensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfstat</b> [ &minus;v ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show the status of the current
or last connection, as well as the status of some of
<b>zftp</b>&rsquo;s status variables. With the
<b>&minus;v</b> option, a more verbose listing is produced
by querying the server for its version of events, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Retrieving
files</b> <br>
The commands for retrieving files all take at least two
options. <b>&minus;G</b> suppresses remote filename
expansion which would otherwise be performed (see below for
a more detailed description of that). <b>&minus;t</b>
attempts to set the modification time of the local file to
that of the remote file: see the description of the function
<b>zfrtime</b> below for more information. <b><br>
zfget [ &minus;Gtc ]</b> <i>file1</i> <b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieve all the listed files
<i>file1</i> ... one at a time from the remote server. If a
file contains a &lsquo;<b>/</b>&rsquo;, the full name is
passed to the remote server, but the file is stored locally
under the name given by the part after the final
&lsquo;<b>/</b>&rsquo;. The option <b>&minus;c</b> (cat)
forces all files to be sent as a single stream to standard
output; in this case the <b>&minus;t</b> option has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfuget [ &minus;Gvst ]</b>
<i>file1</i> <b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As <b>zfget</b>, but only
retrieve files where the version on the remote server is
newer (has a later modification time), or where the local
file does not exist. If the remote file is older but the
files have different sizes, or if the sizes are the same but
the remote file is newer, the user will usually be queried.
With the option <b>&minus;s</b>, the command runs silently
and will always retrieve the file in either of those two
cases. With the option <b>&minus;v</b>, the command prints
more information about the files while it is working out
whether or not to transfer them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfcget [ &minus;Gt ]</b>
<i>file1</i> <b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As <b>zfget</b>, but if any of
the local files exists, and is shorter than the
corresponding remote file, the command assumes that it is
the result of a partially completed transfer and attempts to
transfer the rest of the file. This is useful on a poor
connection which keeps failing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
requires a commonly implemented, but non&minus;standard,
version of the FTP protocol, so is not guaranteed to work on
all servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfgcp [ &minus;Gt ]</b>
<i>remote&minus;file local&minus;file</i> <b><br>
zfgcp [ &minus;Gt ]</b> <i>rfile1</i> <b>...</b>
<i>ldir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This retrieves files from the
remote server with arguments behaving similarly to the
<b>cp</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
form, copy <i>remote&minus;file</i> from the server to the
local file <i>local&minus;file</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
form, copy all the remote files <i>rfile1</i> ... into the
local directory <i>ldir</i> retaining the same basenames.
This assumes UNIX directory semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sending
files <br>
zfput [ &minus;r ]</b> <i>file1</i> <b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Send all the <i>file1</i> ...
given separately to the remote server. If a filename
contains a &lsquo;<b>/</b>&rsquo;, the full filename is used
locally to find the file, but only the basename is used for
the remote file name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With the option
<b>&minus;r</b>, if any of the <i>files</i> are directories
they are sent recursively with all their subdirectories,
including files beginning with &lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo;. This
requires that the remote machine understand UNIX file
semantics, since &lsquo;<b>/</b>&rsquo; is used as a
directory separator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfuput [ &minus;vs ]</b>
<i>file1</i> <b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As <b>zfput</b>, but only send
files which are newer than their local equivalents, or if
the remote file does not exist. The logic is the same as for
<b>zfuget</b>, but reversed between local and remote
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfcput</b> <i>file1</i>
<b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As <b>zfput</b>, but if any
remote file already exists and is shorter than the local
equivalent, assume it is the result of an incomplete
transfer and send the rest of the file to append to the
existing part. As the FTP append command is part of the
standard set, this is in principle more likely to work than
<b>zfcget</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfpcp</b>
<i>local&minus;file remote&minus;file</i> <b><br>
zfpcp</b> <i>lfile1</i> <b>...</b> <i>rdir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This sends files to the remote
server with arguments behaving similarly to the <b>cp</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With two
arguments, copy <i>local&minus;file</i> to the server as
<i>remote&minus;file</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With more than
two arguments, copy all the local files <i>lfile1</i> ...
into the existing remote directory <i>rdir</i> retaining the
same basenames. This assumes UNIX directory semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A problem
arises if you attempt to use <b>zfpcp</b> <i>lfile1
rdir</i>, i.e. the second form of copying but with two
arguments, as the command has no simple way of knowing if
<i>rdir</i> corresponds to a directory or a filename. It
attempts to resolve this in various ways. First, if the
<i>rdir</i> argument is &lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<b>..</b>&rsquo; or ends in a slash, it is assumed to
be a directory. Secondly, if the operation of copying to a
remote file in the first form failed, and the remote server
sends back the expected failure code 553 and a reply
including the string &lsquo;<b>Is a directory</b>&rsquo;,
then <b>zfpcp</b> will retry using the second form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Closing the
connection <br>
zfclose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Close the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Session
management <br>
zfsession</b> [ <b>&minus;lvod</b> ] [ <i>sessname</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows you to manage multiple
FTP sessions at once. By default, connections take place in
a session called &lsquo;<b>default</b>&rsquo;; by giving the
command &lsquo;<b>zfsession</b> <i>sessname</i>&rsquo; you
can change to a new or existing session with a name of your
choice. The new session remembers its own connection, as
well as associated shell parameters, and also the host/user
parameters set by <b>zfparams</b>. Hence you can have
different sessions set up to connect to different hosts,
each remembering the appropriate host, user and
password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With no
arguments, <b>zfsession</b> prints the name of the current
session; with the option <b>&minus;l</b> it lists all
sessions which currently exist, and with the option
<b>&minus;v</b> it gives a verbose list showing the host and
directory for each session, where the current session is
marked with an asterisk. With <b>&minus;o</b>, it will
switch to the most recent previous session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>&minus;d</b>, the given session (or else the current one)
is removed; everything to do with it is completely
forgotten. If it was the only session, a new session called
&lsquo;<b>default</b>&rsquo; is created and made current. It
is safest not to delete sessions while background commands
using <b>zftp</b> are active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zftransfer</b>
<i>sess1</i><b>:</b><i>file1
sess2</i><b>:</b><i>file2</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Transfer files between two
sessions; no local copy is made. The file is read from the
session <i>sess1</i> as <i>file1</i> and written to session
<i>sess2</i> as file <i>file2</i>; <i>file1</i> and
<i>file2</i> may be relative to the current directories of
the session. Either <i>sess1</i> or <i>sess2</i> may be
omitted (though the colon should be retained if there is a
possibility of a colon appearing in the file name) and
defaults to the current session; <i>file2</i> may be omitted
or may end with a slash, in which case the basename of
<i>file1</i> will be added. The sessions <i>sess1</i> and
<i>sess2</i> must be distinct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The operation
is performed using pipes, so it is required that the
connections still be valid in a subshell, which is not the
case under versions of some operating systems, presumably
due to a system bug.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bookmarks</b>
<br>
The two functions <b>zfmark</b> and <b>zfgoto</b> allow you
to &lsquo;bookmark&rsquo; the present location (host, user
and directory) of the current FTP connection for later use.
The file to be used for storing and retrieving bookmarks is
given by the parameter <b>$ZFTP_BMFILE</b>; if not set when
one of the two functions is called, it will be set to the
file <b>.zfbkmarks</b> in the directory where your zsh
startup files live (usually <b>~</b>). <b><br>
zfmark [</b> <i>bookmark</i> <b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If given an argument, mark the
current host, user and directory under the name
<i>bookmark</i> for later use by <b>zfgoto</b>. If there is
no connection open, use the values for the last connection
immediately before it was closed; it is an error if there
was none. Any existing bookmark under the same name will be
silently replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If not given an
argument, list the existing bookmarks and the points to
which they refer in the form
<i>user</i><b>@</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>directory</i>; this
is the format in which they are stored, and the file may be
edited directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfgoto [ &minus;n ]</b>
<i>bookmark</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return to the location given by
<i>bookmark</i>, as previously set by <b>zfmark</b>. If the
location has user &lsquo;<b>ftp</b>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<b>anonymous</b>&rsquo;, open the connection with
<b>zfanon</b>, so that no password is required. If the user
and host parameters match those stored for the current
session, if any, those will be used, and again no password
is required. Otherwise a password will be prompted for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With the option
<b>&minus;n</b>, the bookmark is taken to be a nickname
stored by the <b>ncftp</b> program in its bookmark file,
which is assumed to be <b>~/.ncftp/bookmarks</b>. The
function works identically in other ways. Note that there is
no mechanism for adding or modifying <b>ncftp</b> bookmarks
from the zftp functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other
functions</b> <br>
Mostly, these functions will not be called directly (apart
from <b>zfinit</b>), but are described here for
completeness. You may wish to alter <b>zftp_chpwd</b> and
<b>zftp_progress</b>, in particular. <b><br>
zfinit [ &minus;n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As described above, this is
used to initialize the zftp function system. The
<b>&minus;n</b> option should be used if the zftp command is
already built into the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfautocheck [ &minus;dn
]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This function is called to
implement automatic reopening behaviour, as described in
more detail below. The options must appear in the first
argument; <b>&minus;n</b> prevents the command from changing
to the old directory, while <b>&minus;d</b> prevents it from
setting the variable <b>do_close</b>, which it otherwise
does as a flag for automatically closing the connection
after a transfer. The host and directory for the last
session are stored in the variable <b>$zflastsession</b>,
but the internal host/user/password parameters must also be
correctly set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfcd_match</b> <i>prefix
suffix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This performs matching for
completion of remote directory names. If the remote server
is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the server to list the
remote directory with subdirectories marked, which usually
works but is not guaranteed. On other hosts it simply calls
<b>zfget_match</b> and hence completes all files, not just
directories. On some systems, directories may not even look
like filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfget_match</b> <i>prefix
suffix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This performs matching for
completion of remote filenames. It caches files for the
current directory (only) in the shell parameter
<b>$zftp_fcache</b>. It is in the form to be called by the
<b>&minus;K</b> option of <b>compctl</b>, but also works
when called from a widget&minus;style completion function
with <i>prefix</i> and <i>suffix</i> set appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfrglob</b>
<i>varname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform remote globbing, as
describes in more detail below. <i>varname</i> is the name
of a variable containing the pattern to be expanded; if
there were any matches, the same variable will be set to the
expanded set of filenames on return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zfrtime</b> <i>lfile
rfile</i> <b>[</b> <i>time</i> <b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the local file <i>lfile</i>
to have the same modification time as the remote file
<i>rfile</i>, or the explicit time <i>time</i> in FTP format
<b>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</b> for the GMT timezone. This uses the
shell&rsquo;s <b>zsh/datetime</b> module to perform the
conversion from GMT to local time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zftp_chpwd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This function is called every
time a connection is opened, or closed, or the remote
directory changes. This version alters the title bar of an
<b>xterm</b>&minus;compatible or <b>sun&minus;cmd</b>
terminal emulator to reflect the local and remote hostnames
and current directories. It works best when combined with
the function <b>chpwd</b>. In particular, a function of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><b>chpwd() {
<br>
if [[ &minus;n $ZFTP_USER ]]; then <br>
zftp_chpwd <br>
else <br>
# usual chpwd e.g put host:directory in title bar <br>
fi <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">fits in
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zftp_progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This function shows the status
of the transfer. It will not write anything unless the
output is going to a terminal; however, if you transfer
files in the background, you should turn off progress
reports by hand using &lsquo;<b>zstyle &rsquo;:zftp:*&rsquo;
progress none</b>&rsquo;. Note also that if you alter it,
any output <i>must</i> be to standard error, as standard
output may be a file being received. The form of the
progress meter, or whether it is used at all, can be
configured without altering the function, as described in
the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zffcache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is used to implement
caching of files in the current directory for each session
separately. It is used by <b>zfget_match</b> and
<b>zfrglob</b>.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES
<a name="MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Configuration</b>
<br>
Various styles are available using the standard shell style
mechanism, described in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). Briefly, the
command &lsquo;<b>zstyle &rsquo;:zftp:*&rsquo;</b> <i>style
value</i> ...&rsquo;. defines the <i>style</i> to have value
<i>value</i>; more than one value may be given, although
that is not useful in the cases described here. These values
will then be used throughout the zftp function system. For
more precise control, the first argument, which gives a
context in which the style applies, can be modified to
include a particular function, as for example
&lsquo;<b>:zftp:zfget</b>&rsquo;: the style will then have
the given value only in the <b>zfget</b> function. Values
for the same style in different contexts may be set; the
most specific function will be used, where strings are held
to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns and
shorter patterns. Note that only the top level function
name, as called by the user, is used; calling of lower level
functions is transparent to the user. Hence modifications to
the title bar in <b>zftp_chpwd</b> use the contexts
<b>:zftp:zfopen</b>, <b>:zftp:zfcd</b>, etc., depending
where it was called from. The following styles are
understood: <b><br>
progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Controls the way that
<b>zftp_progress</b> reports on the progress of a transfer.
If empty, unset, or &lsquo;<b>none</b>&rsquo;, no progress
report is made; if &lsquo;<b>bar</b>&rsquo; a growing bar of
inverse video is shown; if &lsquo;<b>percent</b>&rsquo; (or
any other string, though this may change in future), the
percentage of the file transferred is shown. The bar meter
requires that the width of the terminal be available via the
<b>$COLUMNS</b> parameter (normally this is set
automatically). If the size of the file being transferred is
not available, <b>bar</b> and <b>percent</b> meters will
simply show the number of bytes transferred so far.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>zfinit</b> is run, if this style is not defined for the
context <b>:zftp:*</b>, it will be set to
&lsquo;bar&rsquo;.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>update</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of
the progress meter in seconds. No update is made unless new
data has been received, so the actual time interval is
limited only by <b>$ZFTP_TIMEOUT</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As described
for <b>progress</b>, <b>zfinit</b> will force this to
default to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>remote&minus;glob</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;,
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;true&rsquo;, filename generation
(globbing) is performed on the remote machine instead of by
zsh itself; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>titlebar</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;,
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;true&rsquo;, <b>zftp_chpwd</b>
will put the remote host and remote directory into the
titlebar of terminal emulators such as xterm or
sun&minus;cmd that allow this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As described
for <b>progress</b>, <b>zfinit</b> will force this to
default to 1.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>chpwd</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo; &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;true&rsquo;, <b>zftp_chpwd</b> will call the function
<b>chpwd</b> when a connection is closed. This is useful if
the remote host details were put into the terminal title bar
by <b>zftp_chpwd</b> and your usual <b>chpwd</b> also
modifies the title bar.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>zfinit</b> is run, it will determine whether <b>chpwd</b>
exists and if so it will set the default value for the style
to 1 if none exists already.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
is also an associative array <b>zfconfig</b> which contains
values used by the function system. This should not be
modified or overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Remote
globbing</b> <br>
The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename
generation (globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned
off by passing the option <b>&minus;G</b> to each of the
commands. Normally this operates by retrieving a complete
list of files for the directory in question, then matching
these locally against the pattern supplied. This has the
advantage that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting
the setting of the option <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>) can be used.
However, it means that the directory part of a filename will
not be expanded and must be given exactly. If the remote
server does not support the UNIX directory semantics,
directory handling is problematic and it is recommended that
globbing only be used within the current directory. The list
of files in the current directory, if retrieved, will be
cached, so that subsequent globs in the same directory
without an intervening <b>zfcd</b> are much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>remote&minus;glob</b> style (see above) is set, globbing
is instead performed on the remote host: the server is asked
for a list of matching files. This is highly dependent on
how the server is implemented, though typically UNIX servers
will provide support for basic glob patterns. This may in
some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire
list of directory contents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Automatic
and temporary reopening</b> <br>
As described for the <b>zfopen</b> command, a subsequent
<b>zfopen</b> with no parameters will reopen the connection
to the last host (this includes connections made with the
<b>zfanon</b> command). Opened in this fashion, the
connection starts in the default remote directory and will
remain open until explicitly closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Automatic
re&minus;opening is also available. If a connection is not
currently open and a command requiring a connection is
given, the last connection is implicitly reopened. In this
case the directory which was current when the connection was
closed again becomes the current directory (unless, of
course, the command given changes it). Automatic reopening
will also take place if the connection was close by the
remote server for whatever reason (e.g. a timeout). It is
not available if the <b>&minus;1</b> option to <b>zfopen</b>
or <b>zfanon</b> was used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if
the command issued is a file transfer, the connection will
be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a
one&minus;shot mode for transfers. This does not apply to
directory changing or listing commands; for example a
<b>zfdir</b> may reopen a connection but will leave it open.
Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the same
command as automatic opening, i.e a <b>zfdir</b> directly
followed by a <b>zfget</b> will never close the connection
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Information
about the previous connection is given by the <b>zfstat</b>
function. So, for example, if that reports:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Session:
default <br>
Not connected. <br>
Last session: ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then the
command <b>zfget file.txt</b> will attempt to reopen a
connection to <b>ftp.bar.com</b>, retrieve the file
<b>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</b>, and immediately close the
connection again. On the other hand, <b>zfcd ..</b> will
open the connection in the directory <b>/pub</b> and leave
it open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all
the above is local to each session; if you return to a
previous session, the connection for that session is the one
which will be reopened.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Completion</b>
<br>
Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions
and bookmarks is supported. The older,
<b>compctl</b>&minus;style completion is defined when
<b>zfinit</b> is called; support for the new
widget&minus;based completion system is provided in the
function <b>Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp</b>, which should
be installed with the other functions of the completion
system and hence should automatically be available.</p>
