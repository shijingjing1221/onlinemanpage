<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why is
libintl-perl so big? Why don&rsquo;t you use</b>
<i>Encode</i><b>(3pm) for character set conversion instead
of rolling your own version?</b> <i><br>
Encode</i>(3pm) requires at least Perl 5.7.x, whereas
libintl-perl needs to be operational on Perl 5.004.
Internally, libintl-perl uses <i>Encode</i>(3pm) if it is
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do the
gettext functions always unset the utf&minus;8 flag on the
strings it returns?</b> <br>
Because the gettext functions do not know whether the string
is encoded in utf&minus;8 or not. Instead of taking guesses,
it rather unsets the flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I set
the utf&minus;8 flag on strings returned by the gettext
family of functions?</b> <br>
Yes, but it is not recommended. If you absolutely want to do
it, use the function bind_textdomain_filter in
Locale::Messages for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The strings
returned by gettext and friends are by default encoded in
the preferred charset for the user&rsquo;s locale, but there
is no portable way to find out, whether this is utf&minus;8
or not. That means, you either have to enforce utf&minus;8
as the output character set (by means of
<i>bind_textdomain_codeset()</i> and/or the environment
variable <small>OUTPUT_CHARSET</small> ) and override the
user preference, or you run the risk of marking strings as
utf&minus;8 which really aren&rsquo;t utf&minus;8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The whole
concept behind that utf&minus;8 flag introduced in Perl 5.6
is seriously broken, and the above described dilemma is a
proof for that. The best thing you can do with that flag is
get rid of it, and turn it off. Your code will benefit from
it and become less error prone, more portable and
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do
non-ASCII characters in my Gtk2 application look messed
up?</b> <br>
The Perl binding of Gtk2 has a design flaw. It expects all
<small>UI</small> messages to be in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> and it also expects messages to
be flagged as utf&minus;8. The only solution for you is to
enforce all your po files to be encoded in utf&minus;8
(convert them manually, if you need to), and also enforce
that charset in your application, regardless of the
user&rsquo;s locale settings. Assumed that your textdomain
is &quot;org.bar.foo&quot;, you have to code the following
into your main module or script:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  BEGIN {
      bind_textdomain_filter 'org.bar.foo', \&amp;turn_utf_8_on;
      bind_textdomain_codeset 'org.bar.foo', 'utf&minus;8';
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the File
GTestRunner.pm of <i>Test::Unit::GTestRunner</i>(3pm) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
interface Glade2 <small>UI</small> definitions with
libintl-perl?</b> <i><br>
Gtk2::GladeXML</i>(3pm) seems to ignore calls to
<i>bind_textdomain()</i>. See the File GTestRunner.pm of
<i>Test::Unit::GTestRunner</i>(3pm) for a possible
solution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why does
Locale::TextDomain use a double underscore? I am used to a
single underscore from C or other languages.</b> <br>
Function names that consist of exactly one
non-alphanumerical character make the function automatically
global in Perl. Besides, in Perl 6 the concatenation
operator will be the underscore instead of the dot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
switch languages or force a certain language independently
from user settings read from the environment?</b> <br>
The simple answer is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use POSIX qw (setlocale LC_ALL);
    my $language = 'fr';
    my $country = 'FR';
    my $charset = 'iso&minus;8859&minus;1';
    setlocale LC_ALL, &quot;${language}_$country.$charset&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sadly enough,
this will fail in many cases. The problem is that locale
identifiers are not standardized and are completely
system-dependent. Not only their overall format, but also
other details like case-sensitivity. Some systems are very
forgiving about the system &minus; for example normalizing
charset descriptions &minus; others very strict. In order to
be reasonably platform independent, you should try a list of
possible locale identifiers for your desired settings. This
is about what I would try for achieving the above:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   my @tries = qw (
        fr_FR.iso&minus;8859&minus;1 fr_FR.iso8859&minus;1 fr_FR.iso88591
        fr_FR.ISO&minus;8859&minus;1 fr_FR.ISO8859&minus;1 fr_FR.ISO88591
        fr.iso&minus;8859&minus;1 fr.iso8859&minus;1 fr.iso88591
        fr.ISO&minus;8859&minus;1 fr.ISO8859&minus;1 fr.ISO88591
        fr_FR
        French_France.iso&minus;8859&minus;1 French_France.iso8859&minus;1 French_France.iso88591
        French_France.ISO&minus;8859&minus;1 French_France.ISO8859&minus;1 French_France.ISO88591
        French.iso&minus;8859&minus;1 French.iso8859&minus;1 French.iso88591
        French.ISO&minus;8859&minus;1 French.ISO8859&minus;1 French.ISO88591
   );
   foreach my $try (@tries) {
        last if setlocale LC_ALL, $try;
   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set
<i>Locale::Util</i>(3pm) for functions that help you with
this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can force a certain language by setting the environment
variables <small>LANGUAGE, LANG</small> and
<small>OUTPUT_CHARSET,</small> but this is only guaranteed
to work, if you use the pure Perl implementation of gettext
(see the documentation for <i>select_package()</i> in
<i>Locale::Messages</i>(3pm)). You would do the above like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::Messages qw (nl_putenv);
    # LANGUAGE is a colon separated list of languages.
    nl_putenv(&quot;LANGUAGE=fr_FR&quot;);
    # If LANGUAGE is set, LANG should be set to the primary language.
    # This is not needed for gettext, but for other parts of the system
    # it is.
    nl_putenv(&quot;LANG=fr_FR&quot;);
    # Force an output charset like this:
    nl_putenv(&quot;OUTPUT_CHARSET=iso&minus;8859&minus;1&quot;);
    setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, 'C');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
environment variables are <small>GNU</small> extensions, and
they are also honored by libintl-perl. Still, you should
always try to set the locale with setlocale for the
catch-all category <small>LC_ALL.</small> If you miss to do
so, your program&rsquo;s output maybe cluttered, mixing
languages and charsets, if the system runs in a locale that
is not compatible with your own language settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
these environment variables are not guaranteed to work, if
you use an <small>XS</small> version of gettext. In order to
force usage of the pure Perl implementation, do the
following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Locale::Messages&minus;&gt;select_package ('gettext_pp');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you think,
this is brain-damaged, you are right, but I cannot help you.
Actually there should be a more flexible <small>API</small>
than setlocale, but at the time of this writing there
isn&rsquo;t. Until then, the recommentation goes like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        1) Try setting LC_ALL with Locale::Util.
        2) If that does not succeed, either give up or ...
        3) Reset LC_MESSAGES to C/POSIX.
        4) Switch to pure Perl for gettext.
        5) Set the environment variables LANGUAGE, LANG,
           and OUTPUT_CHARSET to your desired values.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is the
advantage of libintl-perl over Locale::Maketext?</b> <br>
Of course, I can only give my personal opinion as an
answer.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
claims to fix design flaws in gettext. These alleged design
flaws, however, boil down to one pathological case which
always has a workaround. But both programmers and
translators pay this fix with an unnecessarily complicated
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The paramount
advantage of libintl-perl is that it uses an approved
technology and concept. Except for Java(tm) programs, this
is the state-of-the-art concept for localizing Un*x
software. Programmers that have already localized software
in C, C <small>++</small> , C#, Python, <small>PHP,</small>
or a number of other languages will feel instantly at home,
when localizing software written in Perl with libintl-perl.
The same holds true for the translators, because the files
they deal with have exactly the same format as those for
other programming languages. They can use the same set of
tools, and even the commands they have to execute are the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
libintl-perl refactoring of the software is painless, even
if you modify, add or delete translatable strings. The
gettext tools are powerful enough to reduce the effort of
the translators to the bare minimum. Maintaining the message
catalogs of Locale::Maketext in larger scale projects, is
<small>IMHO</small> unfeasible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Editing the
message catalogs of Locale::Maketext &minus; they are really
Perl modules &minus; asks too much from most translators,
unless they are programmers. The portable object (po) files
used by libintl-perl have a simple syntax, and there are a
bunch of specialized <small>GUI</small> editors for these
files, that facilitate the translation process and hide most
complexity from the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
libintl-perl makes it possible to mix programming languages
without a paradigm shift in localization. Without any
special efforts, you can write a localized software that has
modules written in C, modules in Perl, and builds a Gtk user
interface with Glade. All translatable strings end up in one
single message catalog.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Last but not
least, the interface used by libintl-perl is plain simple:
Prepend translatable strings with a double underscore, and
you are done in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do
single-quoted strings not work?</b> <br>
You probably write something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print __'Hello';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And you get an
error message like &quot;Can&rsquo;t find string terminator
&quot;&rsquo;&quot; anywhere before <small>EOF</small> at
...&quot;, or even &quot;Bareword found where operator
expected at ... Might be a runaway multi-line &rsquo;&rsquo;
string starting on&quot;. The above line is (really!)
essentially the same as writing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print __::Hello';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A lesser know
feature of Perl is that you can use a single quote
(&quot;&rsquo;&quot;) as the separator in packages instead
of the double colon (&quot;:&quot;). What the Perl parser
sees in the first example is a valid package name
(&quot;__&quot;) followed by the separator
(&quot;&rsquo;&quot;), then another valid package name
(&quot;Hello&quot;) followed by a lone single quote. It is
therefore not a problem in libintl-perl but simple wrong
Perl syntax. You have to correct alternatives:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print __ 'Hello';   # Insert a space to disambiguate.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or use
double-quotes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print __&quot;Hello&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Slavi
Agafonkin for pointing me to the solution of this
mystery.</p>
