<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">audit.rules
&minus; a set of rules loaded in the kernel audit system</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>audit.rules</b>
is a file containing audit rules that will be loaded by the
audit daemon&rsquo;s init script whenever the daemon is
started. The auditctl program is used by the initscripts to
perform this operation. The syntax for the rules is
essentially the same as when typing in an auditctl command
at a shell prompt except you do not need to type the
auditctl command name since that is implied. The audit rules
come in 3 varieties: <i>control</i>, <i>file</i>, and
<i>syscall</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Control</b>
<br>
Control commands generally involve configuring the audit
system rather than telling it what to watch for. These
commands typically include deleting all rules, setting the
size of the kernel&rsquo;s backlog queue, setting the
failure mode, setting the event rate limit, or to tell
auditctl to ignore syntax errors in the rules and continue
loading. Generally, these rules are at the top of the rules
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File
System</b> <br>
File System rules are sometimes called watches. These rules
are used to audit access to particular files or directories
that you may be interested in. If the path given in the rule
is a directory, then the rule used is recursive to the
bottom of the directory tree excluding any directories that
may be mount points. The syntax of these rules generally
follow this format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;w
path-to-file &minus;p permissions &minus;k keyname</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the
permission are any one of the following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</td></tr>

<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>a</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="49%">


<p>- change in the file&rsquo;s attribute</p></td>
<td width="26%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System
Call</b> <br>
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that
intercepts each syscall that all programs on the system
makes. Therefore it is very important to only use syscall
rules when you have to since these affect performance. The
more rules, the bigger the performance hit. You can help the
performance, though, by combining syscalls into one rule
whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Linux
kernel has 4 rule matching lists or filters as they are
sometimes called. They are: task, exit, user, and exclude.
The task list is checked only during the fork or clone
syscalls. It is rarely used in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit filter
is the place where all syscall and file system audit
requests are evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user filter
is used to filter (remove) some events that originate in
user space. By default, any event originating in user space
is allowed. So, if there are some events that you do not
want to see, then this is a place where some can be removed.
See auditctl(8) for fields that are valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exclude
filter is used to exclude certain events from being emitted.
The msgtype field is used to tell the kernel which message
types you do not want to record. This filter can remove the
event as a whole and is not selective about any other
attribute. The user and exit filters are better suited to
selectively auditing events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Syscall rules
take the general form of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;a
action,list &minus;S syscall &minus;F field=value &minus;k
keyname</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;a</b> option tells the kernel&rsquo;s rule
matching engine that we want to append a rule at the end of
the rule list. But we need to specify which rule list it
goes on and what action to take when it triggers. Valid
actions are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>always</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="37%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">- always create an event</p></td>
<td width="31%">
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>never</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="37%">


<p>- never create an event</p></td>
<td width="31%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The action and
list are separated by a comma but no space in between. Valid
lists are: <i>task</i>, <i>exit</i>, <i>user</i>, and
<i>exclude</i>. Their meaning was explained earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next in the
rule would normally be the <b>&minus;S</b> option. This
field can either be the syscall name or number. For
readability, the name is almost always used. You may give
more than one syscall in a rule by specifying another
<b>&minus;S</b> option. When sent into the kernel, all
syscall fields are put into a mask so that one compare can
determine if the syscall is of interest. So, adding multiple
syscalls in one rule is very efficient. When you specify a
syscall name, auditctl will look up the name and get its
syscall number. This leads to some problems on bi-arch
machines. The 32 and 64 bit syscall numbers sometimes, but
not always, line up. So, to solve this problem, you would
generally need to break the rule into 2 with one specifying
&minus;F arch=b32 and the other specifying &minus;F
arch=b64. This needs to go in front of the <b>&minus;S</b>
option so that auditctl looks at the right lookup table when
returning the number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the
syscall is specified, you would normally have one or more
<b>&minus;F</b> options that fine tune what to match
against. Rather than list all the valid field types here,
the reader should look at the auditctl man page which has a
full listing of each field and what it means. But its worth
mentioning a couple things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The audit
system considers uids to be unsigned numbers. The audit
system uses the number &minus;1 to indicate that a loginuid
is not set. This means that when its printed out, it looks
like 4294967295. If you write a rule that you wanted try to
get the valid users of the system, you need to look in
/etc/login.defs to see where user accounts start. For
example, if UID_MIN is 1000, then you would also need to
take into account that the unsigned representation of
&minus;1 is higher than 1000. So you would address this with
the following piece of a rule:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;F
auid&gt;=1000 &minus;F auid!=4294967295</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
individual checks are &quot;anded&quot; and both have to be
true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last thing
to know about syscall rules is that you can add a key field
which is a free form text string that you want inserted into
the event to help identify its meaning. This is discussed in
more detail in the NOTES section.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
auditing is to be able to do an investigation periodically
or whenever an incident occurs. A few simple steps in
planning up front will make this job easier. The best advice
is to use keys in both the watches and system call rules to
give the rule a meaning. If rules are related or together
meet a specific requirement, then give them a common key
name. You can use this during your investigation to select
only results with a specific meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When doing an
investigation, you would normally start off with the main
aureport output to just get an idea about what is happening
on the system. This report mostly tells you about events
that are hard coded by the audit system such as login/out,
uses of authentication, system anomalies, how many users
have been on the machine, and if SE Linux has detected any
AVCs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">aureport
&minus;&minus;start this-week</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After looking
at the report, you probably want to get a second view about
what rules you loaded that have been triggering. This is
where keys become important. You would generally run the key
summary report like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">aureport
&minus;&minus;start this-week &minus;&minus;key
&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will give
an ordered listing of the keys associated with rules that
have been triggering. If, for example, you had a syscall
audit rule that triggered on the failure to open files with
EPERM that had a key field of access like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;a
always,exit &minus;F arch=b64 &minus;S open &minus;F
exit=&minus;EPERM &minus;k access</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then you can
isolate these failures with ausearch and pipe the results to
aureport for display. Suppose your investigation noticed a
lot of the access denied events. If you wanted to see the
files that unauthorized access has been attempted, you could
run the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ausearch
&minus;&minus;start this-week &minus;k access
&minus;&minus;raw | aureport &minus;&minus;file
&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will give
an ordered list showing which files are being accessed with
the EPERM failure. Suppose you wanted to see which users
might be having failed access, you would run the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ausearch
&minus;&minus;start this-week &minus;k access
&minus;&minus;raw | aureport &minus;&minus;user
&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
investigation showed a lot of failed accesses to a
particular file, you could run the following report to see
who is doing it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ausearch
&minus;&minus;start this-week &minus;k access &minus;f
/path-to/file &minus;&minus;raw | aureport
&minus;&minus;user &minus;i</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This report
will give you the individual access attempts by person. If
you needed to see the actual audit event that is being
reported, you would look at the date, time, and event
columns. Assuming the event was 822 and it occurred at 2:30
on 09/01/2009 and you use the en_US.utf8 locale, the command
would look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ausearch
&minus;&minus;start 09/01/2009 02:30 &minus;a 822 &minus;i
&minus;&minus;just&minus;one</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
select the first event from that day and time with the
matching event id and interpret the numeric values into
human readable values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most
important step in being able to do this kind of analysis is
setting up key fields when the rules were originally
written. It should also be pointed out that you can have
more than one key field associated with any given rule.</p>

<h2>TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are not
getting events on syscall rules that you think you should,
try running a test program under strace so that you can see
the syscalls. There is a chance that you might have
identified the wrong syscall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you get a
warning from auditctl saying, &quot;32/64 bit syscall
mismatch in line XX, you should specify an arch&quot;. This
means that you specified a syscall rule on a bi-arch system
where the syscall has a different syscall number for the 32
and 64 bit interfaces. This means that on one of those
interfaces you are likely auditing the wrong syscall. To
solve the problem, re-write the rule as two rules specifying
the intended arch for each rule. For example,</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;always,exit
&minus;S open &minus;k access</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would be
rewritten as</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;always,exit
&minus;F arch=b32 &minus;S open &minus;k access <br>
&minus;always,exit &minus;F arch=b64 &minus;S open &minus;k
access</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you get a
warning that says, &quot;entry rules deprecated, changing to
exit rule&quot;. This means that you have a rule intended
for the entry filter, but that filter is no longer
available. Auditctl moved your rule to the exit filter so
that it&rsquo;s not lost. But to solve this so that you do
not get the warning any more, you need to change the
offending rule from entry to exit.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
rule shows how to audit failed access to files due to
permission problems. Note that it takes two rules for each
arch ABI to audit this since file access can fail with two
different failure codes indicating permission problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;a
always,exit &minus;F arch=b32 &minus;S open &minus;S openat
&minus;F exit=&minus;EACCES &minus;k access <br>
&minus;a always,exit &minus;F arch=b32 &minus;S open
&minus;S openat &minus;F exit=&minus;EPERM &minus;k access
<br>
&minus;a always,exit &minus;F arch=b64 &minus;S open
&minus;S openat &minus;F exit=&minus;EACCES &minus;k access
<br>
&minus;a always,exit &minus;F arch=b64 &minus;S open
&minus;S openat &minus;F exit=&minus;EPERM &minus;k
access</b></p>
