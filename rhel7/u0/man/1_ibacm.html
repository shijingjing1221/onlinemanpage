<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ibacm &minus;
address and route resolution services for InfiniBand.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ibacm</i>
[-D] [-P] [-A addr_file] [-O option_file]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The IB ACM
implements and provides a framework for name, address, and
route (path) resolution services over InfiniBand. It is
intended to address connection setup scalability issues
running MPI applications on large clusters. The IB ACM
provides information needed to establish a connection, but
does not implement the CM protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A primary user
of the ibacm service is the librdmacm library. This enables
applications to make use of the ibacm service without code
changes or needing to be aware that the service is in use.
librdmacm versions 1.0.12 - 1.0.15 can invoke IB ACM
services when built using the --with-ib_acm option. Version
1.0.16 and newer of librdmacm will automatically use the IB
ACM if it is installed. The IB ACM services tie in under the
rdma_resolve_addr, rdma_resolve_route, and rdma_getaddrinfo
routines. For maximum benefit, the rdma_getaddrinfo routine
should be used, however existing applications should still
see significant connection scaling benefits using the calls
available in librdmacm 1.0.11 and previous releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The IB ACM is
focused on being scalable and efficient. The current
implementation limits network traffic, SA interactions, and
centralized services. ACM supports multiple resolution
protocols in order to handle different fabric
topologies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The IB ACM
package is comprised of two components: the ibacm service
and a test/configuration utility - ib_acme. Both are
userspace components and are available for Linux and
Windows. Additional details are given below.</p>

<h2>QUICK START GUIDE
<a name="QUICK START GUIDE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1.
Prerequisites: libibverbs and libibumad must be installed.
The IB stack should be running with IPoIB configured. These
steps assume that the user has administrative
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Install the
IB ACM package. This installs ibacm, ib_acme, and init.d
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Run
&rsquo;ibacm&rsquo; as administrator to start the ibacm
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. Optionally,
run &rsquo;ib_acme -d &lt;dest_ip&gt; -v&rsquo; to verify
that the ibacm service is running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. Install
librdmacm, using the build option --with-ib_acm if needed.
This build option is not needed with librdmacm 1.0.17 or
newer. The librdmacm will automatically use the ibacm
service. On failures, the librdmacm will fall back to normal
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">6. You can use
ib_acme -P to gather performance statistics from the local
ibacm daemon to see if the service is working correctly.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ib_acme:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ib_acme
program serves a dual role. It acts as a utility to test
ibacm operation and help verify if the ibacm service and
selected protocol is usable for a given cluster
configuration. Additionally, it automatically generates
ibacm configuration files to assist with or eliminate manual
setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ibacm
configuration files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ibacm
service relies on two configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
ibacm_addr.cfg file contains name and address mappings for
each IB &lt;device, port, pkey&gt; endpoint. Although the
names in the ibacm_addr.cfg file can be anything, ib_acme
maps the host name and IP addresses to the IB endpoints. If
the address file cannot be found, the ibacm service will
attempt to create one using default values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
ibacm_opts.cfg file provides a set of configurable options
for the ibacm service, such as timeout, number of retries,
logging level, etc. ib_acme generates the ibacm_opts.cfg
file using static information. If an option file cannot be
found, ibacm will use default values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ibacm:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ibacm
service is responsible for resolving names and addresses to
InfiniBand path information and caching such data. It should
execute with administrative privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ibacm
implements a client interface over TCP sockets, which is
abstracted by the librdmacm library. One or more back-end
protocols are used by the ibacm service to satisfy user
requests. Although the ibacm supports standard SA path
record queries on the back-end, it also supports a
resolution protocol based on multicast traffic. The latter
is not usable on all fabric topologies, specifically ones
that may not have reversible paths or fabrics using torus
routing. Users should use the ib_acme utility to verify that
multicast protocol is usable before running other
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conceptually,
the ibacm service implements an ARP like protocol and either
uses IB multicast records to construct path record data or
queries the SA directly, depending on the selected route
protocol. By default, the ibacm services uses and caches SA
path record queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifically,
all IB endpoints join a number of multicast groups.
Multicast groups differ based on rates, mtu, sl, etc., and
are prioritized. All participating endpoints must be able to
communicate on the lowest priority multicast group. The
ibacm assigns one or more names/addresses to each IB
endpoint using the ibacm_addr.cfg file. Clients provide
source and destination names or addresses as input to the
service, and receive as output path record data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The service
maps a client&rsquo;s source name/address to a local IB
endpoint. If a client does not provide a source address,
then the ibacm service will select one based on the
destination and local routing tables. If the destination
name/address is not cached locally, it sends a multicast
request out on the lowest priority multicast group on the
local endpoint. The request carries a list of multicast
groups that the sender can use. The recipient of the request
selects the highest priority multicast group that it can use
as well and returns that information directly to the sender.
The request data is cached by all endpoints that receive the
multicast request message. The source endpoint also caches
the response and uses the multicast group that was selected
to construct or obtain path record data, which is returned
to the client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
implementation of the IB ACM has several additional
restrictions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- The ibacm is
limited in its handling of dynamic changes. ibacm must be
stopped and restarted if a cluster is reconfigured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- Cached data
does not timed out and is only updated if a new resolution
request is received from a different QPN than a cached
request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- Support for
IPv6 has not been verified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- The number of
addresses that can be assigned to a single endpoint is
limited to 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- The number of
multicast groups that an endpoint can support is limited to
2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ibacm
contains several internal caches. These include caches for
GID and LID destination addresses. These caches can be
optionally preloaded. ibacm supports the OpenSM dump_pr
plugin &quot;full&quot; PathRecord format which is used to
preload these caches. The file format is specified in the
ibacm_opts.cfg file via the route_preload setting which
should be set to full_opensm_v1 for this file format.
Default format is none which does not preload these caches.
See dump_pr.notes.txt in dump_pr for more information on the
full_opensm_v1 file format and how to configure OpenSM to
generate this file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
the name, IPv4, and IPv6 caches can be be preloaded by using
the addr_preload option. The default is none which does not
preload these caches. To preload these caches, set this
option to acm_hosts and configure the addr_data_file
appropriately.</p>
