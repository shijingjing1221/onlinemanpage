layout of the XFS filesystem</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An XFS
filesystem can reside on a regular disk partition or on a
logical volume. An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a
data section, a log section, and a realtime section. Using
the default <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) options, the realtime section
is absent, and the log area is contained within the data
section. The log section can be either separate from the
data section or contained within it. The filesystem sections
are divided into a certain number of <i>blocks</i>, whose
size is specified at <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) time with the
<b>&minus;b</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The data
section contains all the filesystem metadata (inodes,
directories, indirect blocks) as well as the user file data
for ordinary (non-realtime) files and the log area if the
log is <i>internal</i> to the data section. The data section
is divided into a number of <i>allocation groups</i>. The
number and size of the allocation groups are chosen by
<b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) so that there is normally a small number
of equal-sized groups. The number of allocation groups
controls the amount of parallelism available in file and
block allocation. It should be increased from the default if
there is sufficient memory and a lot of allocation activity.
The number of allocation groups should not be set very high,
since this can cause large amounts of CPU time to be used by
the filesystem, especially when the filesystem is nearly
full. More allocation groups are added (of the original
size) when <b>xfs_growfs</b>(8) is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The log section
(or area, if it is internal to the data section) is used to
store changes to filesystem metadata while the filesystem is
running until those changes are made to the data section. It
is written sequentially during normal operation and read
only during mount. When mounting a filesystem after a crash,
the log is read to complete operations that were in progress
at the time of the crash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The realtime
section is used to store the data of realtime files. These
files had an attribute bit set through <b>xfsctl</b>(3)
after file creation, before any data was written to the
file. The realtime section is divided into a number of
<i>extents</i> of fixed size (specified at
<b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) time). Each file in the realtime section
has an extent size that is a multiple of the realtime
section extent size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each allocation
group contains several data structures. The first sector
contains the superblock. For allocation groups after the
first, the superblock is just a copy and is not updated
after <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8). The next three sectors contain
information for block and inode allocation within the
allocation group. Also contained within each allocation
group are data structures to locate free blocks and inodes;
these are located through the header structures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each XFS
filesystem is labeled with a Universal Unique Identifier
(UUID). The UUID is stored in every allocation group header
and is used to help distinguish one XFS filesystem from
another, therefore you should avoid using <b>dd</b>(1) or
other block-by-block copying programs to copy XFS
filesystems. If two XFS filesystems on the same machine have
the same UUID, <b>xfsdump</b>(8) may become confused when
doing incremental and resumed dumps. <b>xfsdump</b>(8) and
<b>xfsrestore</b>(8) are recommended for making copies of
XFS filesystems.</p>

<h2>OPERATIONS
<a name="OPERATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
functionality specific to the XFS filesystem is accessible
to applications through the <b>xfsctl</b>(3) and by-handle
(see <b>open_by_handle</b>(3)) interfaces.</p>

<h2>MOUNT OPTIONS
<a name="MOUNT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Refer to the
<b>mount</b>(8) manual entry for descriptions of the
individual XFS mount options.</p>
