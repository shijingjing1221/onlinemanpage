<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">backend &minus;
cups backend transmission interfaces</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>backend <br>
backend</b> job user title num-copies options [
<i>filename</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backends are a
special type of <i>filter(7)</i> which is used to send print
data to and discover different devices on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like filters,
backends must be capable of reading from a filename on the
command-line or from the standard input, copying the
standard input to a temporary file as required by the
physical interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of the destination
printer. Starting with CUPS 1.1.22, any authentication
information in argv[0] is removed, so backend developers are
urged to use the DEVICE_URI environment variable whenever
authentication information is required. The CUPS API
includes a <i>cupsBackendDeviceURI</i> function for
retrieving the correct device URI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Back-channel
data from the device should be relayed to the job filters by
writing to file descriptor 3. The CUPS API includes the
<i>cupsBackChannelWrite</i> function for this purpose.</p>

<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CUPS backends
are not generally design to be run directly by the user.
Aside from the device URI issue (argv[0] and DEVICE_URI
environment variable contain the device URI), CUPS backends
also expect specific environment variables and file
descriptors, and typically run in a user session that (on OS
X) has additional restrictions that affect how it runs.
Backends can also be installed with restricted permissions
(0500 or 0700) that tell the scheduler to run them as the
&quot;root&quot; user instead of an unprivileged user
(typically &quot;lp&quot;) on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless you are
a developer and know what you are doing, please do not run
backends directly. Instead, use the <i>lp(1)</i> or
<i>lpr(1)</i> programs to send a print job or
<i>lpinfo(8)</i> program to query for available printers
using the backend. The one exception is the SNMP backend -
see <i>snmpbackend(8)</i> for more information.</p>

<h2>DEVICE DISCOVERY
<a name="DEVICE DISCOVERY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When run with
no arguments, the backend should list the devices and
schemes it supports or is advertising to stdout. The output
consists of zero or more lines consisting of any of the
following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">device-class
scheme &quot;Unknown&quot; &quot;device-info&quot; <br>
device-class device-uri &quot;device-make-and-model&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; <br>
device-class device-uri &quot;device-make-and-model&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; &quot;device-id&quot; <br>
device-class device-uri &quot;device-make-and-model&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; &quot;device-id&quot;
&quot;device-location&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>device-class</i> field is one of the following values:
<br>
direct</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The device-uri refers to a
specific direct-access device with no options, such as a
parallel, USB, or SCSI device.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>file</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="62%">


<p>The device-uri refers to a file on disk.</p></td>
<td width="20%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">network</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The device-uri refers to a
networked device and conforms to the general form for
network URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">serial</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The device-uri refers to a
serial device with configurable baud rate and other options.
If the device-uri contains a baud value, it represents the
maximum baud rate supported by the device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>scheme</i> field provides the URI scheme that is
supported by the backend. Backends should use this form only
when the backend supports any URI using that scheme. The
<i>device-uri</i> field specifies the full URI to use when
communicating with the device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>device-make-and-model</i> field specifies the make and
model of the device, e.g. &quot;Example Foojet 2000&quot;.
If the make and model is not known, you must report
&quot;Unknown&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>device-info</i> field specifies additional information
about the device. Typically this includes the make and model
along with the port number or network address, e.g.
&quot;Example Foojet 2000 USB #1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>device-id</i> field specifies the IEEE-1284 device ID
string for the device, which is used to select a matching
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>device-location</i> field specifies the physical location
of the device, which is often used to pre-populate the
printer-location attribute when adding a printer.</p>

<h2>PERMISSIONS
<a name="PERMISSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backends
without world execute permissions are run as the root user.
Otherwise, the backend is run using an unprivileged user
account, typically &quot;lp&quot;.</p>

<h2>EXIT CODES
<a name="EXIT CODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
exit codes are defined for backends; C API constants defined
in the &lt;cups/backend.h&gt; header file are defined in
parenthesis: <br>
0 (CUPS_BACKEND_OK)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was successfully
transmitted to the device or remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">1 (CUPS_BACKEND_FAILED)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted to the device or remote server. The
scheduler will respond to this by canceling the job,
retrying the job, or stopping the queue depending on the
state of the error-policy attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">2
(CUPS_BACKEND_AUTH_REQUIRED)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because valid authentication
information is required. The scheduler will respond to this
by holding the job and adding the
&quot;cups-held-for-authentication&quot; keyword to the
&quot;job-reasons&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">3 (CUPS_BACKEND_HOLD)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because it cannot be printed at
this time. The scheduler will respond to this by holding the
job.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">4 (CUPS_BACKEND_STOP)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because it cannot be printed at
this time. The scheduler will respond to this by stopping
the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">5 (CUPS_BACKEND_CANCEL)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because one or more attributes are
not supported or the job was canceled at the printer. The
scheduler will respond to this by canceling the job.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">6 (CUPS_BACKEND_RETRY)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because of a temporary issue. The
scheduler will retry the job at a future time - other jobs
may print before this one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">7
(CUPS_BACKEND_RETRY_CURRENT)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The print file was not
successfully transmitted because of a temporary issue. The
scheduler will retry the job immediately without allowing
intervening jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other exit
code values are reserved.</p>
