<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mtools -
utilities to access DOS disks in Unix.</p>

<h2>Introduction
<a name="Introduction"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools is a
collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate
MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files on an
MS-DOS file system (typically a floppy disk). Where
reasonable, each program attempts to emulate the MS-DOS
equivalent command. However, unnecessary restrictions and
oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is
possible to move subdirectories from one subdirectory to
another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools is
sufficient to give access to MS-DOS file systems. For
instance, commands such as <tt>mdir a:</tt> work on the
<tt>a:</tt> floppy without any preliminary mounting or
initialization (assuming the default
<tt>&lsquo;/etc/mtools.conf&rsquo;</tt> works on your
machine). With mtools, one can change floppies too without
unmounting and mounting.</p>

<h2>Common&nbsp;features&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;mtools&nbsp;commands
<a name="Common&nbsp;features&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;mtools&nbsp;commands"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Options&nbsp;and&nbsp;filenames</b>
<br>
MS-DOS filenames are composed of a drive letter followed by
a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename. Only the filename
part is mandatory, the drive letter and the subdirectory are
optional. Filenames without a drive letter refer to Unix
files. Subdirectory names can use either the
&rsquo;<tt>/</tt>&rsquo; or &rsquo;<tt>\</tt>&rsquo;
separator. The use of the &rsquo;<tt>\</tt>&rsquo; separator
or wildcards requires the names to be enclosed in quotes to
protect them from the shell. However, wildcards in Unix
filenames should not be enclosed in quotes, because here we
<b>want</b> the shell to expand them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The regular
expression &quot;pattern matching&quot; routines follow the
Unix-style rules. For example, &lsquo;<tt>*</tt>&rsquo;
matches all MS-DOS files in lieu of
&lsquo;<tt>*.*</tt>&rsquo;. The archive, hidden, read-only
and system attribute bits are ignored during pattern
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All options use
the <tt>-</tt> (minus) as their first character, not
<tt>/</tt> as you&rsquo;d expect in MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most mtools
commands allow multiple filename parameters, which
doesn&rsquo;t follow MS-DOS conventions, but which is more
user-friendly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most mtools
commands allow options that instruct them how to handle file
name clashes. See section name clashes, for more details on
these. All commands accept the <tt>-V</tt> flags which
prints the version, and most accept the <tt>-v</tt> flag,
which switches on verbose mode. In verbose mode, these
commands print out the name of the MS-DOS files upon which
they act, unless stated otherwise. See section Commands, for
a description of the options which are specific to each
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Drive&nbsp;letters</b>
<br>
The meaning of the drive letters depends on the target
architectures. However, on most target architectures, drive
A is the first floppy drive, drive B is the second floppy
drive (if available), drive J is a Jaz drive (if available),
and drive Z is a Zip drive (if available). On those systems
where the device name is derived from the SCSI id, the Jaz
drive is assumed to be at SCSI target 4, and the Zip at SCSI
target 5 (factory default settings). On Linux, both drives
are assumed to be the second drive on the SCSI bus
(/dev/sdb). The default settings can be changes using a
configuration file (see section Configuration).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The drive
letter : (colon) has a special meaning. It is used to access
image files which are directly specified on the command line
using the <tt>-i</tt> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mcopy -i
my-image-file.bin ::file1 ::file2 .</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This copies
<tt>file1</tt> and <tt>file2</tt> from the image file
(<tt>my-image-file.bin</tt>) to the <tt>/tmp</tt>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
supply an offset within the image file by including
<tt>@@</tt><i>offset</i> into the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mcopy -i
my-image-file.bin@@1M ::file1 ::file2 .</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This looks for
the image at the offset of 1M in the file, rather than at
its beginning.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Current&nbsp;working&nbsp;directory</b>
<br>
The <tt>mcd</tt> command (&lsquo;mcd&rsquo;) is used to
establish the device and the current working directory
(relative to the MS-DOS file system), otherwise the default
is assumed to be <tt>A:/</tt>. However, unlike MS-DOS, there
is only one working directory for all drives, and not one
per drive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VFAT-style&nbsp;long&nbsp;file&nbsp;names</b>
<br>
This version of mtools supports VFAT style long filenames.
If a Unix filename is too long to fit in a short DOS name,
it is stored as a VFAT long name, and a companion short name
is generated. This short name is what you see when you
examine the disk with a pre-7.0 version of DOS. <br>
The following table shows some examples of short names:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Long name
MS-DOS name Reason for the change <br>
--------- ---------- --------------------- <br>
thisisatest THISIS~1 filename too long <br>
alain.knaff ALAIN~1.KNA extension too long <br>
prn.txt PRN~1.TXT PRN is a device name <br>
.abc ABC~1 null filename <br>
hot+cold HOT_CO~1 illegal character</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you see, the
following transformations happen to derive a short name:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p>Illegal characters are replaced by underscores. The
illegal characters are
<tt>;+=[]&rsquo;,\&quot;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|</tt>.</p> </td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>

<p>Extra dots, which cannot be interpreted as a main
name/extension separator are removed</p></td></tr>

<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The name is shortened so as to fit in the 8+3
limitation</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The initial
Unix-style file name (whether long or short) is also called
the <i>primary</i> name, and the derived short name is also
called the <i>secondary</i> name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mcopy
/etc/motd a:Reallylongname</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools creates
a VFAT entry for Reallylongname, and uses REALLYLO as a
short name. Reallylongname is the primary name, and REALLYLO
is the secondary name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mcopy
/etc/motd a:motd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Motd fits into
the DOS filename limits. Mtools doesn&rsquo;t need to
derivate another name. Motd is the primary name, and there
is no secondary name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a nutshell:
The primary name is the long name, if one exists, or the
short name if there is no long name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although VFAT
is much more flexible than FAT, there are still names that
are not acceptable, even in VFAT. There are still some
illegal characters left (<tt>\&quot;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|</tt>),
and device names are still reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unix name

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you see, the
following transformations happen if a long name is
illegal:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Name&nbsp;clashes</b>
<br>
When writing a file to disk, its long name or short name may
collide with an already existing file or directory. This may
happen for all commands which create new directory entries,
such as <tt>mcopy</tt>, <tt>mmd</tt>, <tt>mren</tt>,
<tt>mmove</tt>. When a name clash happens, mtools asks you
what it should do. It offers several choices: <tt><br>
overwrite&nbsp;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Overwrites the existing file.
It is not possible to overwrite a directory with a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><tt>rename&nbsp;</tt></p>

Mtools prompts for the new filename</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><tt>autorename&nbsp;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
command line switches lower/upper differentiates between

lower/upper differentiates between

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
name is the name as displayed in Windows 95 or Windows NT:
i.e. the long name if it exists, and the short name
otherwise. The secondary name is the &quot;hidden&quot;
name, i.e. the short name if a long name exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
user is prompted if the primary name clashes, and the
secondary name is autorenamed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a name clash
occurs in a Unix directory, mtools only asks whether to
overwrite the file, or to skip it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Case&nbsp;sensitivity&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;VFAT&nbsp;file&nbsp;system</b>
<br>
The VFAT file system is able to remember the case of the
filenames. However, filenames which differ only in case are
not allowed to coexist in the same directory. For example if
you store a file called LongFileName on a VFAT file system,
mdir shows this file as LongFileName, and not as
Longfilename. However, if you then try to add LongFilename
to the same directory, it is refused, because case is
ignored for clash checks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The VFAT file
system allows to store the case of a filename in the
attribute byte, if all letters of the filename are the same
case, and if all letters of the extension are the same case
too. Mtools uses this information when displaying the files,
and also to generate the Unix filename when mcopying to a
Unix directory. This may have unexpected results when
applied to files written using an pre-7.0 version of DOS:
Indeed, the old style filenames map to all upper case. This
is different from the behavior of the old version of mtools
which used to generate lower case Unix filenames.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>high&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;formats</b>
<br>
Mtools supports a number of formats which allow to store
more data on disk as usual. Due to different operating
system abilities, these formats are not supported on all
operating systems. Mtools recognizes these formats
transparently where supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
format these disks, you need to use an operating system
specific tool. For Linux, suitable floppy tools can be found
in the <tt>fdutils</tt> package at the following
locations~:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils/.
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/fdutils-*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the manual
pages included in that package for further detail: Use
<tt>superformat</tt> to format all formats except XDF, and
use <tt>xdfcopy</tt> to format XDF. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More&nbsp;sectors</b>
<br>
The oldest method of fitting more data on a disk is to use
more sectors and more cylinders. Although the standard
format uses 80 cylinders and 18 sectors (on a 3 1/2 high
density disk), it is possible to use up to 83 cylinders (on
most drives) and up to 21 sectors. This method allows to
store up to 1743K on a 3 1/2 HD disk. However, 21 sector
disks are twice as slow as the standard 18 sector disks
because the sectors are packed so close together that we
need to interleave them. This problem doesn&rsquo;t exist
for 20 sector formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These formats
are supported by numerous DOS shareware utilities such as
<tt>fdformat</tt> and <tt>vgacopy</tt>. In his infinite
hubris, Bill Gate$ believed that he invented this, and
called it <tt>&lsquo;DMF disks&rsquo;</tt>, or
<tt>&lsquo;Windows formatted disks&rsquo;</tt>. But in
reality, it has already existed years before! Mtools
supports these formats on Linux, on SunOS and on the DELL
Unix PC. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bigger&nbsp;sectors</b>
<br>
By using bigger sectors it is possible to go beyond the
capacity which can be obtained by the standard 512-byte
sectors. This is because of the sector header. The sector
header has the same size, regardless of how many data bytes
are in the sector. Thus, we save some space by using
<i>fewer</i>, but bigger sectors. For example, 1 sector of
4K only takes up header space once, whereas 8 sectors of 512
bytes have also 8 headers, for the same amount of useful
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This method
allows to store up to 1992K on a 3 1/2 HD disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports
these formats only on Linux. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>2m</b> <br>
The 2m format was originally invented by Ciriaco Garcia de
Celis. It also uses bigger sectors than usual in order to
fit more data on the disk. However, it uses the standard
format (18 sectors of 512 bytes each) on the first cylinder,
in order to make these disks easier to handle by DOS. Indeed
this method allows to have a standard sized boot sector,
which contains a description of how the rest of the disk
should be read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
drawback of this is that the first cylinder can hold less
data than the others. Unfortunately, DOS can only handle
disks where each track contains the same amount of data.
Thus 2m hides the fact that the first track contains less
data by using a <i>shadow FAT</i>. (Usually, DOS stores the
FAT in two identical copies, for additional safety. XDF
stores only one copy, but tells DOS that it stores two. Thus
the space that would be taken up by the second FAT copy is
saved.) This also means that you should <b>never use a 2m
disk to store anything else than a DOS file system</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports
these formats only on Linux. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XDF</b> <br>
XDF is a high capacity format used by OS/2. It can hold 1840
K per disk. That&rsquo;s lower than the best 2m formats, but
its main advantage is that it is fast: 600 milliseconds per
track. That&rsquo;s faster than the 21 sector format, and
almost as fast as the standard 18 sector format. In order to
access these disks, make sure mtools has been compiled with
XDF support, and set the <tt>use_xdf</tt> variable for the
drive in the configuration file. See section Compiling
mtools, and &lsquo;miscellaneous variables&rsquo;, for
details on how to do this. Fast XDF access is only available
for Linux kernels which are more recent than 1.1.34.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports
this format only on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Caution /
Attention distributors</b>: If mtools is compiled on a Linux
kernel more recent than 1.3.34, it won&rsquo;t run on an
older kernel. However, if it has been compiled on an older
kernel, it still runs on a newer kernel, except that XDF
access is slower. It is recommended that distribution
authors only include mtools binaries compiled on kernels
older than 1.3.34 until 2.0 comes out. When 2.0 will be out,
mtools binaries compiled on newer kernels may (and should)
be distributed. Mtools binaries compiled on kernels older
than 1.3.34 won&rsquo;t run on any 2.1 kernel or later.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exit&nbsp;codes</b>
<br>
All the Mtools commands return 0 on success, 1 on utter
failure, or 2 on partial failure. All the Mtools commands
perform a few sanity checks before going ahead, to make sure
that the disk is indeed an MS-DOS disk (as opposed to, say
an ext2 or MINIX disk). These checks may reject partially
corrupted disks, which might otherwise still be readable. To
avoid these checks, set the MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK environmental
variable or the corresponding configuration file variable
(see section global variables)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bugs</b>
<br>
An unfortunate side effect of not guessing the proper device
(when multiple disk capacities are supported) is an
occasional error message from the device driver. These can
be safely ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fat
checking code chokes on 1.72 Mb disks mformatted with
pre-2.0.7 mtools. Set the environmental variable
MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY (or the corresponding configuration
file variable, &lsquo;global variables&rsquo;) to bypass the
fat checking.</p>
