IPMI Platform Event Trap Interpreter</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ipmi-pet</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>...] [SPECIFIC TRAP] [VARIABLE BINDING HEX
BYTES ...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ipmi-pet</b>
interprets hex bytes from a platform event trap (PET) and
outputs a string representing its contents. Hex values may
be input on the command line, a file via the
<b>&minus;&minus;file</b> option, or via stdin if neither of
the previous are specified. <b>Ipmi-pet</b> is commonly used
in conjunction with an SNMP trap daemon to intrepret the
results from an IPMI PET trap captured by the daemon. While
<b>ipmi-pet</b> could be called directly from such a daemon,
typically a script is called to parse the SNMP
daemon&rsquo;s output and convert it into a form that can be
input into <b>ipmi-pet.</b> On some systems, you may wish to
also send a PET acknowledge to a remote system to inform it
the trap was received and parsed. One can be sent using the
<b>&minus;&minus;pet-acknowledge</b> option. While an IPMI
session is not required to interpret a PET, data from the
sensor data repository (SDR) is required to properly
interpret sensor names and other information in the PET.
IPMI session configuration below, such as driver, hostname,
username, etc. should be configured to load the SDR of the
host where the trap originated. If this is difficult to
perform, it may be wise to cache and load a specific SDR
cache using the
<b>&minus;&minus;sdr&minus;cache&minus;file</b> option. If
the SDR is difficult to obtain, the
<b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;sdr&minus;cache</b> option can
be specified so that an SDR will not be loaded, and an IPMI
session will not be required. The PET will be interpreted as
best as possible given no SDR. The
<b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;sdr&minus;cache</b> option may
affect other options such as
<b>&minus;&minus;interpret&minus;oem&minus;data</b> too.
Some options, such as
<b>&minus;&minus;manufacturer&minus;id</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;product&minus;id</b> may alleviate some of
these issues. If the SNMP daemon does not output a SNMPv1
<i>specific trap</i> on its own, it is typically output as
the last element of the OID in SNMPv2. If for some reason a
<i>specific trap</i> cannot be determined, the value of
<i>NA</i> may be input for the <i>specific trap</i> to
indicate it is not available. <b>Ipmi-pet</b> will output as
much as possible based on the variable bindings information.
Some of the specific trap information may be obtained via
SDR information.</p>

<h2>IPMI-PET OPTIONS
<a name="IPMI-PET OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are specific to <b>Ipmi-pet.</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>&minus;v</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Output verbose output. This option will output event
direction and OEM custom messages from the trap.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>&minus;vv</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Output very verbose output. This option will output
additional information available in the trap, such as GUID,
manufacturer ID, and system ID.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>&minus;vvv</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Output very very verbose output. This option will output
additional information than verbose output. Most notably it
will output additional hex codes to given information on
ambiguous events. For example, it will output Generator ID
hex codes for sensors without names.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;pet-acknowledge</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Send PET acknowledge using
inputted trap data instead of outputting data. In some
circumstances, this may be useful to inform a remote system
that a trap was received and parsed. If specified, a
hostname must be specified via <i>&minus;h</i> or
<i>&minus;&minus;hostname</i> to inform <b>ipmi-pet</b>
where to send the acknowledge to. When this option is
specified, the SDR cache is not loaded and is not
required.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;file</b>=<i>CMD&minus;FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a file to read PET
specific trap and variable bindings hex from instead of
command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;severity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Output event severity in
output. This will add an additional output of an event
severity. The outputs may be Monitor, Information, OK,
Non-critical condition, Critical condition, or
Non-recoverable condition. This differs from the output of
<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;state</b>, as
event severity is not interpreted, it is a value reported in
the SNMP trap. However, not all events may report a
severity, or some manufacturers may not support the report
of a severity. Event severity will automatically be output
under verbose output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;state</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Output event state in output.
This will add an additional output reporting if an event
should be viewed as NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL. This
differs from the output of
<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;severity</b>, as
this output is an interpreted value that will be interpreted
identically to the
<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;state</b> output
in <b>ipmi-sel(8).</b> As long as an event interpretation is
supported, all events will have outputted state. The event
state is an interpreted value based on the configuration
file /etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf and the
event direction. See <b>freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5)</b>
for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;event&minus;state&minus;config&minus;file</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate event
state configuration file. Option ignored if
<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;event&minus;state</b> not
specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;manufacturer&minus;id</b>=<i>NUMBER</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a specific manufacturer
id to assume. Useful if you wish to specify
<b>&minus;&minus;interpret&minus;oem&minus;data</b>, but the
manufacturer id cannot be determined by IPMI access or is
not available in the SNMP trap. The manufacturer id of a
motherboard can be determined with <b>bmc-info(8).</b> If
this option is specified, so must
<b>&minus;&minus;product&minus;id</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;product&minus;id</b>=<i>NUMBER</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a specific product id
to assume. Useful if you wish to specify
<b>&minus;&minus;interpret&minus;oem&minus;data</b>, but the
product id cannot be determined by IPMI access or is not
available in the SNMP trap. The product id of a motherboard
can be determined with <b>bmc-info(8).</b> If this option is
specified, so must
<b>&minus;&minus;manufacturer&minus;id</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;interpret&minus;oem&minus;data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Attempt to interpret OEM data,
such as event data, sensor readings, or general extra info,
etc. If an OEM interpretation is not available, the default
output will be generated. Correctness of OEM interpretations
cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors
may make in products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION
below for confirmed supported motherboard
interpretations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;entity&minus;sensor&minus;names</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Output sensor names prefixed
with their entity id and instance number when appropriate.
This may be necessary on some motherboards to help identify
what sensors are referencing. For example, a motherboard may
have multiple sensors named &rsquo;TEMP&rsquo;. The entity
id and instance number may help clarify which sensor refers
to &quot;Processor 1&quot; vs. &quot;Processor 2&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;sensor&minus;type&minus;output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not show sensor type output
for each entry. On many systems, the sensor type is
redundant to the name of the sensor. This can especially be
true if <b>&minus;&minus;entity&minus;sensor&minus;names</b>
is specified. If the sensor name is sufficient, or if the
sensor type is of no interest to the user, this option can
be specified to condense output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;comma&minus;separated&minus;output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Output fields in comma
separated format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;header&minus;output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not output column headers.
May be useful in scripting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;non&minus;abbreviated&minus;units</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Output non-abbreviated units
(e.g. &rsquo;Amps&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;A&rsquo;). May
aid in disambiguation of units (e.g. &rsquo;C&rsquo; for
Celsius or Coulombs).</p>

<h2>SDR CACHE OPTIONS
<a name="SDR CACHE OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This tool
requires access to the sensor data repository (SDR) cache
for general operation. By default, SDR data will be
downloaded and cached on the local machine. The following
options apply to the SDR cache. <b><br>
&minus;f</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;flush&minus;cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Flush a cached version of the
sensor data repository (SDR) cache. The SDR is typically
cached for faster subsequent access. However, it may need to
be flushed and re-generated if the SDR has been updated on a
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Q</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not output information about
cache creation/deletion. May be useful in scripting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sdr&minus;cache&minus;recreate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the SDR cache is out of date
or invalid, automatically recreate the sensor data
repository (SDR) cache. This option may be useful for
scripting purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sdr&minus;cache&minus;file</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a specific sensor data
repository (SDR) cache file to be stored or read from. If
this option is used when multiple hosts are specified, the
same SDR cache file will be used for all hosts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sdr&minus;cache&minus;directory</b>=<i>DIRECTORY</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate directory
for sensor data repository (SDR) caches to be stored or read
from. Defaults to the home directory if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;sdr&minus;cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ignore SDR cache related
processing. May lead to incomplete or less useful
information being output, however it will allow
functionality for systems without SDRs or when the correct
SDR cannot be loaded.</p>

<h2>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most often,
IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN
problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote
machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC:
IP address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
<b>bmc-config(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change
these configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI
problems are typically caused by improperly configured
drivers or non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below

the password for the user is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;password
verification timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed
out. A &quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above)
or a generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g

the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try
to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require
authenticating to a different user which has a higher
maximum privilege.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level cannot be obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than
the maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a
lower privilege. It may also be possible the maximum
privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication
type unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try again with an
alternate authentication type or alternate privilege level.
It may also be possible the available authentication types
you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on
the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher

of potential errors are possible, including an invalid
hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved,
IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the network
connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and
connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;session

<h2>WORKAROUNDS
<a name="WORKAROUNDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With so many
different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,
different vendors may implement their IPMI protocols
incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds
currently available to handle discovered compliance issues.
When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
will be transparent to the user. However, some will require
the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hardware
listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem
was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may
or may not exhibit the same problems. Different vendors may
license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware
developer, so it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed
below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
your hardware has an additional compliance issue that needs
a workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI
maintainers on &lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi&minus;devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>assumeio</i>
- This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces
communicate with system I/O rather than being memory-mapped.
This will work around systems that report invalid base
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>spinpoll</i>
- This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most
notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling rather than
putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve
the wall clock running time of tools because an operating
system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be much larger than
the time it takes to perform a single IPMI message
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>authcap</i>
- This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support
and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around
multiple issues in which the remote system does not properly
report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>nochecksumcheck</i>
- This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums due to
implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise valid.
Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it removes
validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances.
However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most situations.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;connection
timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;, or
&quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. On IPMI
1.5 connections, the &quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround
may also needed too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF,
Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>idzero</i> -
This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be
accepted by the client. It works around IPMI sessions that
report empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>unexpectedauth</i>
- This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null
authcodes to be checked as though they were expected. It
works around an issue when packets contain non-null
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer
firmware.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>forcepermsg</i>
- This workaround flag will force per-message authentication
to be used no matter what is advertised by the remote
system. It works around an issue when per-message
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>endianseq</i>
- This workaround flag will flip the endian of the session
sequence numbers to allow the session to continue properly.
It works around IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are
the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>noauthcodecheck</i>
- This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return invalid
authentication codes due to hashing or implementation
errors. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes an authentication check verifying the validity of a
packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely to
be a security issue. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Xyratex FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>intel20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management
Module (Professional Edition).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>supermicro20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro
IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon
IPMI firmware. The issues covered include handling invalid
length authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed
on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sun20</i> -
This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround automatically includes the
&quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>opensesspriv</i>
- This workaround flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s
IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid
hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege
level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g
invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status code&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM,
Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro
X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel
S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN.
This workaround is automatically triggered with the
&quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>integritycheckvalue</i>
- This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity
check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when
using Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be
0 length, however the remote motherboard responds with a
non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;k_g
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG,
Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and
Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>assumemaxsdrrecordcount</i>
- This workaround will inform SDR reading to stop reading
after a known maximum numer of SDR records have been read.
This will work around systems that have mis-implemented SDR
reading functions that. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;SDR record count invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed
on unspecified Inspur motherboard.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>malformedack</i>
- This workaround flag will ignore malformed PET acknowledge
responses and assume any PET acknowledge response from the
remote machine is valid. It works around remote systems that
respond with PET acknowledge requests with invalid/malformed
IPMI payloads. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors when executing a PET
acknowledge. Issue observed on Dell Poweredge R610.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5
Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been
found to not support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;driver&minus;type</b>=<i>LAN_2_0</i>. Issue
observed on HP Proliant DL 145.</p>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES
<a name="KNOWN ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
operating systems, if you input your username, password, and
other potentially security relevant information on the
command line, this information may be discovered by other
users when using tools like the <b>ps(1)</b> command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information
in the FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an
appropriate way to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
&quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote authentication
