</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DECLARE
<i>name</i> [ BINARY ] [ INSENSITIVE ] [ [ NO ] SCROLL ]
<br>
CURSOR [ { WITH | WITHOUT } HOLD ] FOR <i>query</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>DECLARE</b></i>
allows a user to create cursors, which can be used to
retrieve a small number of rows at a time out of a larger
query. After the cursor is created, rows are fetched from it
using <b>FETCH</b>(7).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
This page describes usage of cursors at the SQL command
level. If you are trying to use cursors inside a PL/pgSQL
function, the rules are different &mdash; see Section 39.7,
&ldquo;Cursors&rdquo;, in the documentation.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the cursor to be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BINARY</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Causes the cursor to return
data in binary rather than in text format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">INSENSITIVE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicates that data retrieved
from the cursor should be unaffected by updates to the
table(s) underlying the cursor that occur after the cursor
is created. In PostgreSQL, this is the default behavior; so
this key word has no effect and is only accepted for
compatibility with the SQL standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCROLL, NO
SCROLL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">SCROLL specifies that the
cursor can be used to retrieve rows in a nonsequential
fashion (e.g., backward). Depending upon the complexity of
the query's execution plan, specifying SCROLL might impose a
performance penalty on the query's execution time. NO SCROLL
specifies that the cursor cannot be used to retrieve rows in
a nonsequential fashion. The default is to allow scrolling
in some cases; this is not the same as specifying SCROLL.
See NOTES for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WITH HOLD,
WITHOUT HOLD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">WITH HOLD specifies that the
cursor can continue to be used after the transaction that
created it successfully commits. WITHOUT HOLD specifies that
the cursor cannot be used outside of the transaction that
created it. If neither WITHOUT HOLD nor WITH HOLD is
specified, WITHOUT HOLD is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>query</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>SELECT</b>(7) or
<b>VALUES</b>(7) command which will provide the rows to be
returned by the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The key words
BINARY, INSENSITIVE, and SCROLL can appear in any order.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normal cursors
return data in text format, the same as a <b>SELECT</b>
would produce. The BINARY option specifies that the cursor
should return data in binary format. This reduces conversion
effort for both the server and client, at the cost of more
programmer effort to deal with platform&minus;dependent
binary data formats. As an example, if a query returns a
value of one from an integer column, you would get a string
of 1 with a default cursor, whereas with a binary cursor you
would get a 4&minus;byte field containing the internal
representation of the value (in big&minus;endian byte
order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Binary cursors
should be used carefully. Many applications, including psql,
are not prepared to handle binary cursors and expect data to
come back in the text format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
When the client application uses the &ldquo;extended
query&rdquo; protocol to issue a <b>FETCH</b> command, the
Bind protocol message specifies whether data is to be
retrieved in text or binary format. This choice overrides
the way that the cursor is defined. The concept of a binary
cursor as such is thus obsolete when using extended query
protocol &mdash; any cursor can be treated as either text or
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless WITH
HOLD is specified, the cursor created by this command can
only be used within the current transaction. Thus,
<b>DECLARE</b> without WITH HOLD is useless outside a
transaction block: the cursor would survive only to the
completion of the statement. Therefore PostgreSQL reports an
error if such a command is used outside a transaction block.
Use <b>BEGIN</b>(7) and <b>COMMIT</b>(7) (or
<b>ROLLBACK</b>(7)) to define a transaction block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If WITH HOLD is
specified and the transaction that created the cursor
successfully commits, the cursor can continue to be accessed
by subsequent transactions in the same session. (But if the
creating transaction is aborted, the cursor is removed.) A
cursor created with WITH HOLD is closed when an explicit
<b>CLOSE</b> command is issued on it, or the session ends.
In the current implementation, the rows represented by a
held cursor are copied into a temporary file or memory area
so that they remain available for subsequent
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WITH HOLD may
not be specified when the query includes FOR UPDATE or FOR
SHARE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SCROLL
option should be specified when defining a cursor that will
be used to fetch backwards. This is required by the SQL
standard. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
PostgreSQL will allow backward fetches without SCROLL, if
the cursor's query plan is simple enough that no extra
overhead is needed to support it. However, application
developers are advised not to rely on using backward fetches
from a cursor that has not been created with SCROLL. If NO
SCROLL is specified, then backward fetches are disallowed in
any case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backward
fetches are also disallowed when the query includes FOR
UPDATE or FOR SHARE; therefore SCROLL may not be specified
in this case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Caution</big></b>
<br>
Scrollable and WITH HOLD cursors may give unexpected results
if they invoke any volatile functions (see Section 35.6,
&ldquo;Function Volatility Categories&rdquo;, in the
documentation). When a previously fetched row is
re&minus;fetched, the functions might be re&minus;executed,
perhaps leading to results different from the first time.
One workaround for such cases is to declare the cursor WITH
HOLD and commit the transaction before reading any rows from
it. This will force the entire output of the cursor to be
materialized in temporary storage, so that volatile
functions are executed exactly once for each row.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the cursor's
query includes FOR UPDATE or FOR SHARE, then returned rows
are locked at the time they are first fetched, in the same
way as for a regular <b>SELECT</b>(7) command with these
options. In addition, the returned rows will be the most
up&minus;to&minus;date versions; therefore these options
provide the equivalent of what the SQL standard calls a
&ldquo;sensitive cursor&rdquo;. (Specifying INSENSITIVE
together with FOR UPDATE or FOR SHARE is an error.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Caution</big></b>
<br>
It is generally recommended to use FOR UPDATE if the cursor
is intended to be used with <b>UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT
OF</b> or <b>DELETE ... WHERE CURRENT OF</b>. Using FOR
UPDATE prevents other sessions from changing the rows
between the time they are fetched and the time they are
updated. Without FOR UPDATE, a subsequent WHERE CURRENT OF
command will have no effect if the row was changed since the
cursor was created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another reason
to use FOR UPDATE is that without it, a subsequent WHERE
CURRENT OF might fail if the cursor query does not meet the
SQL standard's rules for being &ldquo;simply
updatable&rdquo; (in particular, the cursor must reference
just one table and not use grouping or ORDER BY). Cursors
that are not simply updatable might work, or might not,
depending on plan choice details; so in the worst case, an
application might work in testing and then fail in
production.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The main reason
not to use FOR UPDATE with WHERE CURRENT OF is if you need
the cursor to be scrollable, or to be insensitive to the
subsequent updates (that is, continue to show the old data).
If this is a requirement, pay close heed to the caveats
shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL
standard only makes provisions for cursors in embedded SQL.
The PostgreSQL server does not implement an <b>OPEN</b>
statement for cursors; a cursor is considered to be open
when it is declared. However, ECPG, the embedded SQL
preprocessor for PostgreSQL, supports the standard SQL
cursor conventions, including those involving <b>DECLARE</b>
and <b>OPEN</b> statements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see all
available cursors by querying the pg_cursors system
view.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To declare a
cursor:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">DECLARE liahona
CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM films;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>FETCH</b>(7) for more examples of cursor usage.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL
standard says that it is implementation&minus;dependent
whether cursors are sensitive to concurrent updates of the
underlying data by default. In PostgreSQL, cursors are
insensitive by default, and can be made sensitive by
specifying FOR UPDATE. Other products may work
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL
standard allows cursors only in embedded SQL and in modules.
PostgreSQL permits cursors to be used interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Binary cursors
are a PostgreSQL extension.</p>
