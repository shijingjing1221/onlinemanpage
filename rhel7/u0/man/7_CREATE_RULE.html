&minus; define a new rewrite rule</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE [ OR
REPLACE ] RULE <i>name</i> AS ON <i>event</i> <br>
TO <i>table_name</i> [ WHERE <i>condition</i> ] <br>
DO [ ALSO | INSTEAD ] { NOTHING | <i>command</i> | (
<i>command</i> ; <i>command</i> ... ) }</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
RULE</b> defines a new rule applying to a specified table or
view. <b>CREATE OR REPLACE RULE</b> will either create a new
rule, or replace an existing rule of the same name for the
same table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PostgreSQL
rule system allows one to define an alternative action to be
performed on insertions, updates, or deletions in database
tables. Roughly speaking, a rule causes additional commands
to be executed when a given command on a given table is
executed. Alternatively, an INSTEAD rule can replace a given
command by another, or cause a command not to be executed at
all. Rules are used to implement table views as well. It is
important to realize that a rule is really a command
transformation mechanism, or command macro. The
transformation happens before the execution of the commands
starts. If you actually want an operation that fires
independently for each physical row, you probably want to
use a trigger, not a rule. More information about the rules
system is in Chapter 37, The Rule System, in the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Presently, ON
SELECT rules must be unconditional INSTEAD rules and must
have actions that consist of a single <b>SELECT</b> command.
Thus, an ON SELECT rule effectively turns the table into a
view, whose visible contents are the rows returned by the
rule's <b>SELECT</b> command rather than whatever had been
stored in the table (if anything). It is considered better
style to write a <b>CREATE VIEW</b> command than to create a
real table and define an ON SELECT rule for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can create
the illusion of an updatable view by defining ON INSERT, ON
UPDATE, and ON DELETE rules (or any subset of those that's
sufficient for your purposes) to replace update actions on
the view with appropriate updates on other tables. If you
want to support <b>INSERT RETURNING</b> and so on, then be
sure to put a suitable RETURNING clause into each of these
rules. Alternatively, an updatable view can be implemented
using INSTEAD OF triggers (see CREATE TRIGGER
(<b>CREATE_TRIGGER</b>(7))).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
catch if you try to use conditional rules for view updates:
there <i>must</i> be an unconditional INSTEAD rule for each
action you wish to allow on the view. If the rule is
conditional, or is not INSTEAD, then the system will still
reject attempts to perform the update action, because it
thinks it might end up trying to perform the action on the
dummy table of the view in some cases. If you want to handle
all the useful cases in conditional rules, add an
unconditional DO INSTEAD NOTHING rule to ensure that the
system understands it will never be called on to update the
dummy table. Then make the conditional rules
non&minus;INSTEAD; in the cases where they are applied, they
add to the default INSTEAD NOTHING action. (This method does
not currently work to support RETURNING queries,
however.)</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of a rule to create.
This must be distinct from the name of any other rule for
the same table. Multiple rules on the same table and same
event type are applied in alphabetical name order.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>event</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The event is one of SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of the table or view the rule
applies to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>condition</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any SQL conditional expression
(returning boolean). The condition expression cannot refer
to any tables except NEW and OLD, and cannot contain
aggregate functions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>INSTEAD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">INSTEAD indicates that the
commands should be executed <i>instead of</i> the original
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ALSO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">ALSO indicates that the
commands should be executed <i>in addition to</i> the
original command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If neither ALSO
nor INSTEAD is specified, ALSO is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The command or commands that
make up the rule action. Valid commands are <b>SELECT</b>,
<b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, <b>DELETE</b>, or
<b>NOTIFY</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within
<i>condition</i> and <i>command</i>, the special table names
NEW and OLD can be used to refer to values in the referenced
table. NEW is valid in ON INSERT and ON UPDATE rules to
refer to the new row being inserted or updated. OLD is valid
in ON UPDATE and ON DELETE rules to refer to the existing
row being updated or deleted.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You must be the
owner of a table to create or change rules for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a rule for
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a view, you can add a RETURNING
clause that emits the view's columns. This clause will be
used to compute the outputs if the rule is triggered by an
<b>INSERT RETURNING</b>, <b>UPDATE RETURNING</b>, or
<b>DELETE RETURNING</b> command respectively. When the rule
is triggered by a command without RETURNING, the rule's
RETURNING clause will be ignored. The current implementation
allows only unconditional INSTEAD rules to contain
RETURNING; furthermore there can be at most one RETURNING
clause among all the rules for the same event. (This ensures
that there is only one candidate RETURNING clause to be used
to compute the results.) RETURNING queries on the view will
be rejected if there is no RETURNING clause in any available
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is very
important to take care to avoid circular rules. For example,
though each of the following two rule definitions are
accepted by PostgreSQL, the <b>SELECT</b> command would
cause PostgreSQL to report an error because of recursive
expansion of a rule:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE RULE
&quot;_RETURN&quot; AS <br>
ON SELECT TO t1 <br>
DO INSTEAD <br>
SELECT * FROM t2;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE RULE
&quot;_RETURN&quot; AS <br>
ON SELECT TO t2 <br>
DO INSTEAD <br>
SELECT * FROM t1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT * FROM
t1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Presently, if a
rule action contains a <b>NOTIFY</b> command, the
<b>NOTIFY</b> command will be executed unconditionally, that
is, the <b>NOTIFY</b> will be issued even if there are not
any rows that the rule should apply to. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE RULE
notify_me AS ON UPDATE TO mytable DO ALSO NOTIFY
mytable;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">UPDATE mytable
SET name = 'foo' WHERE id = 42;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">one
<b>NOTIFY</b> event will be sent during the <b>UPDATE</b>,
whether or not there are any rows that match the condition
id = 42. This is an implementation restriction that might be
fixed in future releases.</p>
