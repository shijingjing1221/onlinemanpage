<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ipsec.secrets
&minus; secrets for IKE/IPsec authentication</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
ipsec.secrets contains a list of secrets, aka preshared
secrets, RSA signatures, or pointers to X.509 Digital
Certificates. These secrets are used by
<b>ipsec_pluto</b>(8) , the Libreswan Internet Key Exchange
daemon, to authenticate other hosts. Currently there are
five kinds of secrets: preshared secrets, RSA private keys,
passphrases for X.509 certificates and if compiled with
<b>USE_XAUTH=true</b> there is support for XAUTH static
passwords. Smartcard support has been moved to the NSS
framework.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is vital
that these secrets be protected. The file should be owned by
root, and permissions should be set to block all access by
others. (eg: chmod 600)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file is a
sequence of entries and include directives. Here is an
example &minus; each entry or directive must start at the
left margin, but if it continues beyond a single line, each
continuation line must be indented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each entry in
the file is a list of indices, followed by a secret. The two
parts are separated by a colon (<b>:</b>) that is followed
by whitespace or a newline. For compatibility with the
previous form of this file, if the key part is just a
double&minus;quoted string the colon may be left out. If
filenames are not absolute paths, they are relative to the
<b>ipsec.d/private/</b> directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An index is an
IP address, or a Fully Qualified Domain Name, user@FQDN,
<b>%any</b> or <b>%any6</b> (other kinds may come). An IP
address may be written in the familiar dotted quad form or
as a domain name to be looked up when the file is loaded (or
in any of the forms supported by the Libreswan
<b>ipsec_ttoaddr</b>(3) routine). In many cases it is a bad
idea to use domain names because the name server may not be
running or may be insecure. To denote a Fully Qualified
Domain Name (as opposed to an IP address denoted by its
domain name), precede the name with an at sign
(<b>@</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Matching IDs
with indices is fairly straightforward: they have to be
equal. In the case of a &ldquo;Road Warrior&rdquo;
connection, if an equal match is not found for the
Peer&acute;s ID, and it is in the form of an IP address, an
index of <b>%any</b> will match the peer&acute;s IP address
if IPV4 and <b>%any6</b> will match a the peer&acute;s IP
address if IPV6. Currently, the obsolete notation 0.0.0.0
may be used in place of <b>%any</b>, but please stop doing
this, as it will likely stop working around Libreswan
v3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This file is
only read at startup time. If any changes are made to this
file, the pluto daemon should be told to re&minus;read this
file using the command <b>ipsec secrets</b> or <b>ipsec auto
&minus;&minus;rereadsecrets</b>. If there are any keyfiles
protected by a passphrase using <b>%prompt</b>, you will be
prompted again to enter these passphrases. To skip the
prompting, just hit return to skip unlocking that particular
private key. Note that currently there is no way to add a
specific new entry &minus; it&acute;s all or nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Smartcard
support has been moved from Libreswan to NSS. Please see the
NSS documentation on how to configure smartcards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
complexity arises in the case of authentication by preshared
secret: the responder will need to look up the secret before
the Peer&acute;s ID payload has been decoded, so the ID used
will be the IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To authenticate
a connection between two hosts, the entry that most
specifically matches the host and peer IDs is used. An entry
with no index will match any host and peer. More
specifically, an entry with one index will match a host and
peer if the index matches the host&acute;s ID (the peer
isn&acute;t considered). Still more specifically, an entry
with multiple indices will match a host and peer if the host
ID and peer ID each match one of the indices. If the key is
for an asymmetric authentication technique (i.e. a public
key system such as RSA), an entry with multiple indices will
match a host and peer even if only the host ID matches an
index (it is presumed that the multiple indices are all
identities of the host). It is acceptable for two entries to
be the best match as long as they agree about the secret or
private key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authentication
by preshared secret requires that both systems find the
identical secret (the secret is not actually transmitted by
the IKE protocol). If both the host and peer appear in the
index list, the same entry will be suitable for both systems
so verbatim copying between systems can be used. This
naturally extends to larger groups sharing the same secret.
Thus multiple&minus;index entries are best for PSK
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authentication
by RSA Signatures requires that each host have its own
private key. A host could reasonably use a different private
keys for different interfaces and for different peers. But
it would not be normal to share entries between systems.
Thus no&minus;index and one&minus;index forms of entry often
make sense for RSA Signature authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The key part of
an entry may start with a token indicating the kind of key.
&ldquo;RSA&rdquo; signifies RSA private key and
&ldquo;PSK&rdquo; signifies PreShared Key (case is ignored).
For compatibility with previous forms of this file, PSK is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The token
&ldquo;XAUTH&rdquo; indicates a eXtended Authentication
password. There should be one indice, and it should be in
the @FQDN format. The file will be searched with the XAUTH
username, which is usually provided in the configuration
file. XAUTH is otherwise identical to PSK in syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the RSA
points to a filename, this is assumed to be a PEM (or DER?)
encoded X.509 private key. The private key may be protected
by a 3DES encryption. 1DES encrypted key files will be
rejected. If the private key is protected by a passphrase
and this passphrase is not specified in
<b>ipsec.secrets</b>, the connection cannot be automatically
started using <b>auto=start</b>, but instead must be brought
up using <b>ipsec auto &minus;&minus;up connname</b>, upon
which the user will be prompted for the passphrase to unlock
the private key belonging to the X.509 certificate. PKCS#12
files, which include the private key file, cannot be
specified in <b>ipsec.secrets</b>. Private keys can be
extracted from PKCS#12 files using the following command:
<b>openssl pkcs12 &minus;nocerts &minus;in clientCert.p12
&minus;out clientKey.pem</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A preshared
secret is most conveniently represented as a sequence of
characters, delimited by the double&minus;quote character
(<b>&quot;</b>). The sequence cannot contain a newline or
double&minus;quote. Strictly speaking, the secret is
actually the sequence of bytes that is used in the file to
represent the sequence of characters (excluding the
delimiters). A preshared secret may also be represented,
without quotes, in any form supported by
<b>ipsec_ttodata</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An RSA private
key is a composite of eight generally large numbers. The
notation used is a brace&minus;enclosed list of field name
and value pairs (see the example above). A suitable key, in
a suitable format, may be generated by
<b>ipsec_rsasigkey</b>(8). The structure is very similar to
that used by BIND 8.2.2 or later, but note that the numbers
must have a &ldquo;0s&rdquo; prefix if they are in base 64.
The order of the fields is fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first token
an entry must start in the first column of its line.
Subsequent tokens must be separated by whitespace, except
for a colon token, which only needs to be followed by
whitespace. A newline is taken as whitespace, but every line
of an entry after the first must be indented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whitespace at
the end of a line is ignored (except in the 0t notation for
a key). At the start of line or after whitespace, <b>#</b>
and the following text up to the end of the line is treated
as a comment. Within entries, all lines must be indented
(except for lines with no tokens). Outside entries, no line
may be indented (this is to make sure that the file layout
reflects its structure).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An include
directive causes the contents of the named file to be
processed before continuing with the current file. The
filename is subject to &ldquo;globbing&rdquo; as in
<b>sh</b>(1), so every file with a matching name is
processed. Includes may be nested to a modest depth (10,
currently). If the filename doesn&acute;t start with a
<b>/</b>, the directory containing the current file is
prepended to the name. The include directive is a line that
starts with the word <b>include</b>, followed by whitespace,
followed by the filename (which must not contain
whitespace).</p>
