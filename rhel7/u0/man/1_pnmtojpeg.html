<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg</b>
converts the named PBM, PGM, or PPM image file, or the
standard input if no file is named, to a JFIF file on the
standard output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg</b>
uses the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library to
create the output file. See
<b><a href="http://www.ijg.org"></b>http://www.ijg.org<b></a></b>
for information on the library.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;JFIF&rsquo;
is the correct name for the image format commonly known as
&rsquo;JPEG.&rsquo; Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">EXIF is an
image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF
file that contains an EXIF header as an APP1 marker).
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> creates an EXIF image when you specify the
<b>-exif</b> option.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
options are: <b><br>
-exif=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies that the
output image is to be EXIF (a subformat of JFIF), i.e. it
will have an EXIF header as a JFIF APP1 marker. The contents
of that marker are the contents of the specified file. The
special value <b>-</b> means to read the EXIF header
contents from standard input. It is invalid to specify
standard input for both the EXIF header and the input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The EXIF file
starts with a two byte field which is the length of the
file, including the length field, in pure binary, most
significant byte first. The special value of zero for the
length field means there is to be no EXIF header, i.e. the
same as no <b>-exif</b> option. This is useful for when you
convert a file from JFIF to PNM using <b>jpegtopnm</b>, then
transform it, then convert it back to JFIF with
<b>pnmtojpeg</b>, and you don&rsquo;t know whether or not it
includes an EXIF header. <b>jpegtopnm</b> creates an EXIF
file containing nothing but two bytes of zero when the input
JFIF file has no EXIF header. Thus, you can transfer any
EXIF header from the input JFIF to the output JFIF without
worrying about whether an EXIF header actually exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the EXIF file after the length field are the exact byte for
byte contents of the APP1 marker, not counting the length
field, that constitutes the EXIF header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-quality=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Scale quantization tables to
adjust image quality. <i>n</i> is 0 (worst) to 100 (best);
default is 75. Below about 25 can produce images some
interpreters won&rsquo;t be able to interpret. See below for
more info.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-grayscale <br>
-greyscale</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>-rgb</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>These options determine the color space used in the JFIF
output. <b>-grayscale</b> (or <b>-greyscale</b>) means to
create a gray scale JFIF, converting from color PPM input if
necessary. <b>-rgb</b> means to create an RGB JFIF, and the
program fails if the input is not PPM.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
neither, The output file is in YCbCr format if the input is
PPM, and grayscale format if the input is PBM or PGM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">YCbCr format (a
color is represented by an intensity value and two
chrominance values) usually compresses much better than RGB
(a color is represented by one red, one green, and one blue
value). RGB is rare. But you may be able to convert between
JFIF and PPM faster with RGB, since it&rsquo;s the same
color space PPM uses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>testimg.ppm</b> file that comes with Netpbm is 2.3 times
larger with the <b>-rgb</b> option than with the YCbCr
default, and in one experiment <b>pnmtojpeg</b> took 16%
more CPU time to convert it. The extra CPU time probably
indicates that processing of all the extra compressed data
consumed all the CPU time saved by not having to convert the
RGB inputs to YCbCr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Grayscale
format takes up a lot less space and takes less time to
create and process than the color formats, even if the image
contains nothing but black, white, and gray.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-rgb</b>
option was added in Netpbm 10.11 in October 2002.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-density=</b><i>density</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option determines the
density (aka resolution) information recorded in the JFIF
output image. It does not affect the raster in any way; it
just tells whoever reads the JFIF how to interpret the
raster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The density
value takes the form <i>x</i><b>x</b><i>y</i> followed by an
optional unit specifier of <b>dpi</b> or <b>dpcm</b>.
Examples: <b>1x1</b>, <b>3x2</b>, <b>300x300dpi</b>,
<b>100x200dpcm</b>. The first number is the horizontal
density; the 2nd number is the vertical density. Each may be
any integer from 1 to 65535. The unit specifier is
<b>dpi</b> for dots per inch or <b>dpcm</b> for dots per
centimeter. If you don&rsquo;t specify the units, the
density information goes into the JFIF explicitly stating
&quot;density unspecified&quot; (also interpreted as
&quot;unknown&quot;). This may seem pointless, but note that
even without specifying the units, the density numbers tell
the aspect ratio of the pixels. E.g. <b>1x1</b> tells you
the pixels are square. <b>3x2</b> tells you the pixels are
vertical rectangles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you specify different horizontal and vertical densities, the
resulting JFIF image is <i>not</i> a true representation of
the input PNM image, because <b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts the
raster pixel-for-pixel and the pixels of a PNM image are
defined to be square. Thus, if you start with a square PNM
image and specify <b>-density=3x2</b>, the resulting JFIF
image is a horizontally squashed version of the original.
However, it is common to use an input image which is a
slight variation on PNM rather than true PNM such that the
pixels are not square. In that case, the appropriate
-density option yields a faithful reproduction of the input
pseudo-PNM image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
1x1 in unspecified units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.15 (April 2003), this option did not exist and the
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> always created a JFIF with a density of 1x1
in unspecified units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-optimize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform optimization of entropy
encoding parameters. Without this, <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses
default encoding parameters. <b>-optimize</b> usually makes
the JFIF file a little smaller, but <b>pnmtojpeg</b> runs
somewhat slower and needs much more memory. Image quality
and speed of decompression are unaffected by
<b>-optimize</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-progressive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a progressive JPEG file
(see below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-comment=</b><i>text</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Include a comment marker in the
JFIF output, with comment text <i>text</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, there are no comment markers in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-quality</b> option lets you trade off compressed file
size against quality of the reconstructed image: the higher
the quality setting, the larger the JFIF file, and the
closer the output image will be to the original input.
Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting
(smallest file) that decompresses into something visually
indistinguishable from the original image. For this purpose
the quality setting should be between 50 and 95 for
reasonable results; the default of 75 is often about right.
If you see defects at <b>-quality=75</b>, then go up 5 or 10
counts at a time until you are happy with the output image.
(The optimal setting will vary from one image to
another.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-quality=100</b>
generates a quantization table of all 1&rsquo;s, minimizing
loss in the quantization step (but there is still
information loss in subsampling, as well as roundoff error).
This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
purposes. Quality values above about 95 are <i>not</i>
recommended for normal use; the compressed file size goes up
dramatically for hardly any gain in output image
quality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the other
direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small
files of low image quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be
useful in preparing an index of a large image library, for
example. Try <b>-quality=2</b> (or so) for some amusing
Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25
generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are considered
optional in the JFIF standard. <b>pnmtojpeg</b> emits a
warning message when you give such a quality value, because
some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode the
resulting file. Use <b>-baseline</b> if you need to ensure
compatibility at low quality values.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-progressive</b> option creates a &rsquo;progressive
JPEG&rsquo; file. In this type of JFIF file, the data is
stored in multiple scans of increasing quality. If the file
is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the
decoder can use the first scan to display a low-quality
image very quickly, and can then improve the display with
each subsequent scan. The final image is exactly equivalent
to a standard JFIF file of the same quality setting, and the
total file size is about the same -- often a little
smaller.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Caution:</b>
progressive JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many
decoders will be unable to view a progressive JPEG file at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
trying to control the quality/file size tradeoff, you might
consider the JPEG2000 format instead. See
<b>pamtojpeg2k</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options for
advanced users: <b><br>
-dct=int</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use integer DCT method
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-dct=fast</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use fast integer DCT (less
accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-dct=float</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use floating-point DCT method.
The float method is very slightly more accurate than the int
method, but is much slower unless your machine has very fast
floating-point hardware. Also note that results of the
floating-point method may vary slightly across machines,
while the integer methods should give the same results
everywhere. The fast integer method is much less accurate
than the other two.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-arithmetic</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use arithmetic coding. Default
is Huffman encoding. Arithmetic coding tends to get you a
smaller result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You may need
patent licenses to use this option. According to
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq">the JPEG FAQ</a>
, This method is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T,
and Mitsubishi.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The author of
the FAQ recommends against using arithmetic coding (and
therefore this option) because the space savings is not
great enough to justify the legal hassles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Most JPEG
libraries, including any distributed by the Independent JPEG
Group since about 1998 are not capable of arithmetic
encoding. <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses a JPEG library (either bound
to it when the <b>pnmtojpeg</b> executable was built or
accessed on your system at run time) to do the JPEG
encoding. If <b>pnmtojpeg</b> terminates with the message,
&rsquo;Sorry, there are legal restrictions on arithmetic
coding&rsquo; or &rsquo;Sorry, arithmetic coding not
supported,&rsquo; this is the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-restart=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Emit a JPEG restart marker
every <i>n</i> MCU rows, or every <i>n</i> MCU blocks if you
append <b>B</b> to the number. <b>-restart 0</b> (the
default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-smooth=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Smooth the input image to
eliminate dithering noise. <i>n</i>, ranging from 1 to 100,
indicates the strength of smoothing. 0 (the default) means
no smoothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-maxmemory=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set a limit for amount of
memory to use in processing large images. Value is in
thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes if you append
<b>M</b> to the number. For example, <b>-max=4m</b> selects
4,000,000 bytes. If <b>pnmtojpeg</b> needs more space, it
will use temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print to the Standard Error
file messages about the conversion process. This can be
helpful in debugging problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-restart</b> option tells <b>pnmtojpeg</b> to insert
extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder to resynchronize
after a transmission error. Without restart markers, any
damage to a compressed file will usually ruin the image from
the point of the error to the end of the image; with restart
markers, the damage is usually confined to the portion of
the image up to the next restart marker. Of course, the
restart markers occupy extra space. We recommend
<b>-restart=1</b> for images that will be transmitted across
unreliable networks such as Usenet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate
fine-scale noise. This is often useful when converting
dithered images to JFIF: a moderate smoothing factor of 10
to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file,
resulting in a smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image.
Too large a smoothing factor will visibly blur the image,
however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options for
wizards: <b><br>
-baseline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force baseline-compatible
quantization tables to be generated. This clamps
quantization values to 8 bits even at low quality settings.
(This switch is poorly named, since it does not ensure that
the output is actually baseline JPEG. For example, you can
use <b>-baseline</b> and <b>-progressive</b> together.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-qtables=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the quantization tables
given in the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-qslots=n[,...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select which quantization table
to use for each color component.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-sample=</b><i>H</i><b>x</b><i>V</i>[,...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set JPEG sampling factors for
each color component.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-scans=</b><i>filespec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the scan script given in
the specified text file. See below for information on scan
scripts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-tracelevel=</b><i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This sets the level of debug
tracing the program outputs as it runs. 0 means none, and is
the default. This level primarily controls tracing of the
JPEG library, and you can get some pretty interesting
information about the compression process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&rsquo;wizard&rsquo; options are intended for
experimentation with JPEG. If you don&rsquo;t know what you
are doing, <b>don&rsquo;t use them</b>. These switches are
documented further in the file wizard.doc that comes with
the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60
and saves the output as foo.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmtojpeg
-quality=60 foo.ppm &gt; foo.jpg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
more typical example. It converts from BMP to JFIF:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cat foo.bmp
| bmptoppm | pnmtojpeg &gt; foo.jpg</b></p>

<h2>JPEG Loss
<a name="JPEG Loss"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
compress with JPEG, you lose information -- i.e. the
resulting image has somewhat lower quality than the
original. This is a characteristic of JPEG itself, not any
particular program. So if you do the usual Netpbm thing and
convert from JFIF to PNM, manipulate, then convert back to
JFIF, you will lose quality. The more you do it, the more
you lose. Drawings (charts, cartoons, line drawings, and
such with few colors and sharp edges) suffer the most.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this,
you can use a compressed image format other than JPEG. PNG
and JPEG2000 are good choices, and Netpbm contains
converters for those.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need to
use JFIF on a drawing, you should experiment with
<b>pnmtojpeg</b>&rsquo;s <b>-quality</b> and <b>-smooth</b>
options to get a satisfactory conversion. <b>-smooth 10</b>
or so is often helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of the
loss, you should do all the manipulation you have to do on
the image in some other format and convert to JFIF as the
last step. And if you can keep a copy in the original
format, so much the better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-optimize</b> option to <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is worth using
when you are making a &rsquo;final&rsquo; version for
posting or archiving. It&rsquo;s also a win when you are
using low quality settings to make very small JFIF files;
the percentage improvement is often a lot more than it is on
larger files. (At present, <b>-optimize</b> mode is
automatically in effect when you generate a progressive JPEG
file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can do
flipping and rotating transformations losslessly with the
program <b>jpegtran</b>, which is packaged with the
Independent Jpeg Group&rsquo;s JPEG library. <b>jpegtran</b>
exercises its intimate knowledge of the way JPEG works to do
the transformation without ever actually decompressing the
image.</p>

<h2>Another program, cjpeg, is similar. cjpeg is
<a name="Another program, cjpeg, is similar. cjpeg is"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">maintained by
the Independent JPEG Group and packaged with the JPEG
library which <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses for all its JPEG work.
Because of that, you may expect it to exploit more current
JPEG features. Also, since you have to have the library to
run <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, but not vice versa, <b>cjpeg</b> may
be more commonly available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, <b>cjpeg</b> does not use the NetPBM libraries to
process its input, as all the NetPBM tools such as
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> do. This means it is less likely to be
consistent with all the other programs that deal with the
NetPBM formats. Also, the command syntax of <b>pnmtojpeg</b>
is consistent with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike
<b>cjpeg</b>.</p>

<h2>SCAN SCRIPTS
<a name="SCAN SCRIPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
<b>-scan</b> option to specify a scan script. Or use the
<b>-progressive</b> option to specify a particular built-in
scan script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just what a
scan script is, and the basic format of the scan script
file, is covered in the <b>wizard.doc</b> file that comes
with the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library. Scan
scripts are same for <b>pnmtojpeg</b> as the are for
<b>cjpeg</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
contains additional information that isn&rsquo;t, but
probably should be, in that document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, there
are many restrictions on what is a valid scan script. The
JPEG library, and thus <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, checks thoroughly
for any lack of compliance with these restrictions, but does
little to tell you how the script fails to comply. The
messages are very general and sometimes untrue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To start with,
the entries for the DC coefficient must come before any
entries for the AC coefficients. The DC coefficient is
Coefficient 0; all the other coefficients are AC
coefficients. So in an entry for the DC coefficient, the two
numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0. In an entry for AC
coefficients, the first number after the colon must not be
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a DC entry,
the color components must be in increasing order. E.g.
&rsquo;0,2,1&rsquo; before the colon is wrong. So is
&rsquo;0,0,0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In an entry for
an AC coefficient, you must specify only one color
component. I.e. there can be only one number before the
colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
entry for a particular coefficient for a particular color
component, the &rsquo;Ah&rsquo; value must be zero, but the
Al value can be any valid bit number. In subsequent entries,
Ah must be the Al value from the previous entry (for that
coefficient for that color component), and the Al value must
be one less than the Ah value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The script must
ultimately specify at least some of the DC coefficient for
every color component. Otherwise, you get the error message
&rsquo;Script does not transmit all the data.&rsquo; You
need not specify all of the bits of the DC coefficient, or
any of the AC coefficients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
standard option in building the JPEG library to omit scan
script capability. If for some reason your library was built
with this option, you get the message &rsquo;Requested
feature was omitted at compile time.&rsquo;</p>
