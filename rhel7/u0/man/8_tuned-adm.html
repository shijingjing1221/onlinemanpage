<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tuned-adm
&minus; commandline tool for switching between different
tuning profiles</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tuned-adm

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
line utility allows user to switch between user definable
tuning profiles. Several predefined profiles are already
included. You can even create your own profile, either based
on one of the existing ones by copying it or make a
completely new one. The distribution provided profiles are
stored in subdirectories below /usr/lib/tuned and the user
defined profiles in subdirectories below /etc/tuned. If
there are same profiles on both places, user defined
profiles have precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The power
saving profiles contain settings that are typically not
enabled by default as they will noticeably impact the
latency/performance of your system as opposed to the power
saving mechanisms that are enabled by default. On the other
hand the performance profiles disable the additional power
saving mechanisms of tuned as they would negatively impact
throughput or latency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Recommend profile suitable for

- it decides according to data in /etc/system-release-cpe
and virt-what output. The rules for autodetection are
defined in recommend.conf in profile directory. They can be
overriden by user by putting the recommend.conf into
/etc/tuned. The default rules recommends profiles targeted
to the best performance or balanced profile if unsure.</p>

<h2>PREDEFINED PROFILES
<a name="PREDEFINED PROFILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the moment
we&rsquo;re providing the following pre defined profiles:
<b><br>
balanced</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is the default profile. It
provides balanced power saving and performance. At the
moment it enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned and it makes
sure the ondemand governor is active (if supported by the
current cpufreq driver). It sets the CPU energy performance
bias to normal. It also enables AC97 audio power saving or
(it depends on your system) HDA-Intel power savings with 10
seconds timeout. In case your system contains supported
Radeon graphics card (with enabled KMS) it configures it to
automatic power saving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>powersave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximal power saving, at the
moment it enables USB autosuspend (in case environment
variable USB_AUTOSUSPEND is set to 1), enables ALPM power
saving for SATA host adapters, enables WiFi power saving,
enables multi core power savings scheduler for low wakeup
systems and makes sure the ondemand governor is active (if
supported by the current cpufreq driver). It sets the CPU
energy performance bias to powersave. It also enables AC97
audio power saving or (it depends on your system) HDA-Intel
power savings (with 10 seconds timeout). In case your system
contains supported Radeon graphics card (with enabled KMS)
it configures it to automatic power saving. On Asus Eee PCs
dynamic Super Hybrid Engine is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>throughput-performance</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for typical throughput
performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms and
enables sysctl settings that improve the throughput
performance of your disk and network IO. CPU governor is set
to performance and CPU energy performance bias is set to
performance. Disk readahead values are increased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>latency-performance</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for low latency
performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms. CPU
governor is set to performance andlocked to the low C states
(by PM QoS). CPU energy performance bias to performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>network-throughput</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for throughput network
tuning. It is based on the throughput-performance profile.
It additionaly increases kernel network buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>network-latency</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for low latency network
tuning. It is based on the latency-performance profile. It
additionaly disables transparent hugepages, NUMA balancing
and tunes several other network related sysctl
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>desktop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for desktops
based on balanced profile. It additionaly enables scheduler
autogroups for better response of interactive
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>virtual-guest</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for virtual
guests based on throughput-performance profile. It
additionally decreases virtual memory swapiness and
increases dirty_ratio settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>virtual-host</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for virtual
hosts based on throughput-performance profile. It
additionally enables more aggresive writeback of dirty
pages.</p>

<p><b>sap</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Profile optimized for the best performance of SAP
software. It is based on throughput-performance profile. It
additionally tunes sysctl settings regarding shared memory,
semaphores and maximum number of memory map areas a process
may have.</p></td></tr>

<h2>PREDEFINED COMPAT PROFILES
<a name="PREDEFINED COMPAT PROFILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We are also
providing so called &quot;compat&quot; profiles that are
here mostly for backward compatibility with tuned 1.0. They
are oriented to more specific scenarios. <b><br>
default</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is the lowest of the
available profiles in regard to power saving and only
enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>desktop-powersave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A power saving profile directed
at desktop systems. Enables ALPM power saving for SATA host
adapters as well as the CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of
tuned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>server-powersave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A power saving profile directed
at server systems. Enables ALPM power saving for SATA host
adapters, and activates the CPU and disk plugins of
tuned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>laptop-ac-powersave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Medium power saving profile
directed at laptops running on AC. Enables ALPM power saving
for SATA host adapters, WiFi power saving as well as CPU,
