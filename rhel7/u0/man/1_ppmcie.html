<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
creates a PPM file containing a plot of the CIE
&rsquo;tongue&rsquo; color chart -- to the extent possible
in a PPM image. Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of
the color tongue using RGB values from a color system of
your choice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The CIE color
tongue is an image of all the hues that can be described by
CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates. They are arranged on a two
dimensional coordinate plane with the X chromaticity on the
horizontal axis and the Y chromaticity on the vertical
scale. (You can choose alternatively to use CIE
u&rsquo;-v&rsquo; chromaticity coordinates, but the general
idea of the color tongue is the same).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
PPM format specifies that the RGB values in the file are
from the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 color system,
gamma-corrected. And positive. See <b>ppm</b>(1) <br>
for details. If you use one of the color system options on
<b>ppmcie</b>, what you get is not a true PPM image, but is
very similar. If you display such <b>ppmcie</b> output using
a device that expects PPM input (which includes just about
any computer graphics display program), it will display the
wrong colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, you
may have a device that expects one of these variations on
PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In every RGB
color system you can specify, including the default (which
produces a true PPM image) there are hues in the color
tongue that can&rsquo;t be represented. For example,
monochromatic blue-green with a wavelength of 500nm cannot
be represented in a PPM image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these hues,
<b>ppmcie</b> substitutes a similar hue as follows: They are
desaturated and rendered as the shade where the edge of the
Maxwell triangle intersects a line drawn from the requested
shade to the white point defined by the color system&rsquo;s
white point. Furthermore, unless you specify the
<b>-full</b> option, <b>ppmcie</b> reduces their intensity
by 25% compared to the true hues in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
draws and labels the CIE X-Y coordinate axes unless you
choose otherwise with options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
draws the Maxwell triangle for the color system in use on
the color tongue. The Maxwell triangle is the triangle whose
vertices are the primary illuminant hues for the color
system. The hues inside the triangle show the color gamut
for the color system. They are also the only ones that are
correct for the CIE X-Y chromaticity coordinates shown. (See
explanation above). <b>ppmcie</b> denotes the Maxwell
triangle by rendering it at full brightness, while rendering
the rest of the color tongue as 3/4 brightness. You can turn
this off with options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
also places a black cross at the color system&rsquo;s white
point (with the center of the cross open so you can actually
see the white color) and displays in text the CIE X-Y
chromaticities of the primary illuminants and white point
for the color system. You can turn this off with options,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
annotates the periphery of the color tongue with the
wavelength, in nanometers of the monochromatic hues which
appear there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmcie</b>
displays the black body chromaticity curve for Planckian
radiators from 1000 to 30000 kelvins on the image. This
curve traces the colors of black bodies as various
temperatures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can choose
from several standard color systems, or specify one of your
own numerically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CIE charts, by
their very nature, contain a very large number of colors. If
you&rsquo;re encoding the chart for a color mapped device or
file format, you&rsquo;ll need to use <b>pnmquant</b> or
<b>ppmdither</b> to reduce the number of colors in the
image.</p>

<h2>INTERPRETATION OF COLOR CHART
<a name="INTERPRETATION OF COLOR CHART"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A color
spectrum is a linear combination of one or more
monochromatic colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A color is a
set of color spectra that all look the same to the human eye
(and brain). Actually, for the purposes of the definition,
we assume the eye has infinite precision, so we can call two
color spectra different colors even though they&rsquo;re so
close a person couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell them apart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The eye
contains 3 kinds of color receptors (cones). Each has a
different response to the various monochromatic colors. One
kind responds most strongly to blue, another red, another
green. Because there are only three, many different color
spectra will excite the cones at exactly the same level, so
the eye cannot tell them apart. All such spectra that excite
the cones in the same way are a single color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each point in
the color tongue represents a unique color. But there are an
infinite number of color spectra in the set that is that
color; i.e. an infinite number of color spectra that would
look to you like this point. A machine could tell them
apart, but you could not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
the colors outside the highlighted triangle are
approximations of the real colors because the PPM format
cannot represent them (and your display device probably
cannot display them). That is, unless you&rsquo;re using a
variation of PPM and a special display device, as discussed
earlier in this manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A color is
always relative to some given maximum brightness. A
particular beam of light looks lime green if in a dim field,
but pea green if in a bright field. An image on a movie
screen may look pitch black because the projector is not
shining any light on it, but when you turn off the projector
and look at the same spot in room light, the screen looks
quite white. The same light from that spot hit your eye with
the project on as with it off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The chart shows
two dimensions of color. The third is intensity. All the
colors in the chart have the same intensity. To get all
possible colors in the gamut, Make copies of the whole chart
at every intensity between zero and the maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The edge of the
tongue consists of all the monochromatic colors. A
monochromatic color is one with a single wavelength. I.e. a
color that is in a rainbow. The numbers you see are the
wavelengths in nanometers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any straight
line segment within the tongue contains colors which are
linear combinations of two colors -- the colors at either
end of the line segment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any color in
the chart can be created from two other colors (actually,
from any of an infinite number of pairs of other
colors).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the colors
within a triangle inside the tongue can be created from a
linear combination of the colors at the vertices of that
triangle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any color in
the tongue can be created from at most 3 monochromatic
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The highlighted
triangle shows the colors that can be expressed in the
tristimulus color system you chose. (ITU-R BT.709 by
default). The corners of the triangle are the 3 primary
illuminants in that system (a certain red, green, and blue
for BT.709). The edges of the triangle, then, represent the
colors you can represent with two of the primary illuminants
(saturated colors), and the interior colors require all
three primary illuminants (are not saturated).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the ITU-R
BT.709 color system (the default), the white point is
defined as D65, which is (and is named after) the color of a
black body at 6502 kelvins. Therefore, you should see the
temperature curve on the image pass through the white part
of the image, and the cross that marks the white point, at
6502 kelvins.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">D65 white is
supposed to be the color of the sun. If you have a perfect
BT.709 display device, you should see the color of the sun
at the white point cross. That&rsquo;s an important color,
because when you look at an object in sunlight, the color
that reflects of the object is based on the color of
sunlight. Note that the sun produces a particular color
spectrum, but many other color spectra are the same color,
and display devices never use the actual color spectrum of
the sun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The colors at
the corners of the triangle have the chromaticities
phosphors in a monitor that uses the selected color system.
Note that in BT.709 they are very close to monochromatic
red, green, and blue, but not quite. That&rsquo;s why you
can&rsquo;t display even one true color of the rainbow on a
video monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
the chart shows colors of constant intensity, therefore the
corners of the triangles are not the full colors of the
primary illuminants, but only their chromaticities. In fact,
the illuminants typically have different intensities. In
BT.709, the blue primary illuminant is far more intense than
the green, which is more intense than the red. Designers did
this in order to make an equal combination of red, green,
and blue generate gray. I.e. a combination of full strength
red, full strength green, and full strength blue BT.709
primary illuminants is D65 white.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tongue has
a sharp straight edge at the bottom because that&rsquo;s the
limit of human vision. There are colors below that line, but
they involve infrared and ultraviolet light, so you
can&rsquo;t see them. This line is called the &rsquo;line of
purples.&rsquo;</p>
