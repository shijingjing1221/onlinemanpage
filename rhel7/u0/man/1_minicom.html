<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">minicom &minus;
friendly serial communication program</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>minicom</b>
[options] [<i>configuration</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>minicom</b>
is a communication program which somewhat resembles the
shareware program TELIX but is free with source code and
runs under most Unices. Features include dialing directory
with auto-redial, support for UUCP-style lock files on
serial devices, a separate script language interpreter,
capture to file, multiple users with individual
configurations, and more.</p>

<h2>COMMAND-LINE
<a name="COMMAND-LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;s,
--setup</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>S</b>etup. Root edits the
system-wide defaults in /etc/minirc.dfl with this option.
When it is used, minicom does <i>not</i> initialize, but
puts you directly into the configuration menu. This is very
handy if minicom refuses to start up because your system has
changed, or for the first time you run minicom. For most
systems, reasonable defaults are already compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o, --noinit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Do not initialize. Minicom will
skip the initialization code. This option is handy if you
quit from minicom without resetting, and then want to
restart a session. It is potentially dangerous though: no
check for lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could
interfere with things like UUCP... maybe this will be taken
out later. For now it is assumed, that users who are given
access to a modem are responsible enough for their
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m, --metakey</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Override command-key with the
Meta or ALT key. This is the default in 1.80 and it can also
be configured in one of minicom&rsquo;s menus, but if you
use different terminals all the time, of which some
don&rsquo;t have a Meta or ALT key, it&rsquo;s handy to set
the default command key to Ctrl-A and use this option when
you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT keys. Minicom
assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC prefix, not the
other variant that sets the highest bit of the
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;M, --metakey8</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Same as &minus;m, but assumes
that your Meta key sets the 8th bit of the character high
(sends 128 + character code).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;z, --statline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use terminal status line. This
only works on terminals that support it and that have the
relevant information in their <i>termcap</i> or
<i>terminfo</i> database entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l, --ansi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>L</b>iteral translation of
characters with the high bit set. With this flag on, minicom
will try to translate the IBM line characters to ASCII. Many
PC-unix clones will display character correctly without
translation (Linux in a special mode, Coherent and SCO).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L, --iso</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Ditto but assume screen uses an
ISO8859 character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w, --wrap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Turns line-wrap on at startup
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;H,
--displayhex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Turn on output in hex mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;a,
--attrib=on/off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>A</b>ttribute usage. Some
terminals, notably Televideo&rsquo;s, have rotten attribute
handling (serial instead of parallel). By default, minicom
uses &rsquo;&minus;a on&rsquo;, but if you are using such a
terminal you can (must!) supply the option &rsquo;&minus;a
off&rsquo;. The trailing &rsquo;on&rsquo; or
&rsquo;off&rsquo; is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t,
--term=TERM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>T</b>erminal type. With this
flag, you can override the environment TERM variable. This
is handy for use in the MINICOM environment variable; one
can create a special termcap entry for use with minicom on
the console, that initializes the screen to raw mode so that
in conjunction with the &minus;l flag, the IBM line
characters are displayed untranslated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c,
--color=on/off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>C</b>olor usage. Some
terminals (such as the Linux console) support color with the
standard ANSI escape sequences. Because there is apparently
no termcap support for color, these escape sequences are
hard-coded into minicom. Therefore this option is off by
default. You can turn it on with &rsquo;&minus;c on&rsquo;.
This, and the &rsquo;&minus;m&rsquo; option, are good
candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;S,
--script=SCRIPT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>script</b>. Run the named
script at startup. So far, passing username and password to
a startup script is not supported. If you also use the
&minus;d option to start dialing at startup, the &minus;S
script will be run BEFORE dialing the entries specified with
&minus;d.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d,
--dial=ENTRY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>D</b>ial an entry from the
dialing directory on startup. You can specify an index
number, but also a substring of the name of the entry. If
you specify a name that has multiple entries in the
directory, they are all tagged for dialing. You can also
specify multiple names or index numbers by separating them
with commas. The dialing will start from the first entry
specified after all other program initialization procedures
are completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p,
--ptty=TTYP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>P</b>seudo terminal to use.
This overrides the terminal port defined in the
configuration files, but only if it is a pseudo TTY. The
filename supplied must be of the form (/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f],
(/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f] or (/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example,
/dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or /dev/ptyp2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C,
--capturefile=FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>filename</b>. Open capture
file at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;T,
--disabletime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Disable the display of the
online time in the status bar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b, --baudrate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the baud rate,
overriding the value given in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D, --device</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the device, overriding
the value given in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;R,
--remotecharset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the character set of
the remote system is using and convert it to the character
set of the local side. Example might be
&rsquo;latin1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;7, --7bit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">7bit mode for terminals which
aren&rsquo;t 8bit capable. 8bit is default if the
environment is configured for this via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;8, --8bit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">8bit characters pass through
without any modification. &rsquo;Continuous&rsquo; means no
locate/attribute control sequences are inserted without real
change of locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit
multi-byte characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every
language with 8bit characters. (For example displaying
Finnish text doesn&rsquo;t need this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h, --help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Display help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v, --version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the minicom version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>minicom</b> starts, it first searches the MINICOM
environment variable for command-line arguments, which can
be over-ridden on the command line. Thus, if you have
done</p>


<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">MINICOM='&minus;m
&minus;c on' <br>
export MINICOM</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">or the equivalent, and start
minicom, minicom will assume that your terminal <i>has</i> a
Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and that color is supported. If you
then log in from a terminal without color support, and you
have set MINICOM in your startup (.profile or equivalent)
file, and don&rsquo;t want to re-set your environment
variable, you can type &rsquo;minicom &minus;c off&rsquo;
and run without color support for that session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>configuration</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <i>configuration</i>
argument is more interesting. Normally, minicom gets its
defaults from a file called &quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you
however give an argument to minicom, it will try to get its
defaults from a file called
&quot;minirc.<i>configuration</i>&quot;. So it is possible
to create multiple configuration files, for different ports,
different users etc. Most sensible is to use device names,
such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc. If a user creates his own
configuration file, it will show up in his home directory as
&quot;.minirc.dfl&quot; or
&quot;.minirc.<i>configuration</i>&quot;.</p>

<h2>USE

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Minicom is
window based. To pop-up a window with the function you want,
press Control-A (from now on, we will use C-A to mean
Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or A-Z). By
pressing C-A first and then &rsquo;z&rsquo;, a help screen
comes up with a short summary of all commands. This escape
key can be altered when minicom is configured (&minus;s
option or C-A O), but we&rsquo;ll stick to Control-A for
now.</p>

While the modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel
dialing. Any other key will close the dial window, but
won&rsquo;t cancel the dialing itself. Your dialing
directory will be saved into the file &quot;.dialdir&quot;

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>H - Terminal
Emulation</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Use ANSI or VT100
emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>I - Backspace key
sends</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">What code (Backspace or Delete)
the backspace key sends.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>J - Linewrap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Can be on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>K - Line settings</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Bps rate, bits, parity and
number of stop bits to use for this connection. You can
choose <b>current</b> for the speed, so that it will use
whatever speed is being used at that moment (useful if you
have multiple modems).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>L - Conversion table</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">You may specify a character
conversion table to be loaded whenever this entry answers,
before running the login script. If this field is blank, the
conversion table stays unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The edit menu also shows the
latest date and time when you called this entry and the
total number of calls there, but doesn&rsquo;t let you
change them. They are updated automatically when you
connect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The moVe
command lets you move the highlighted entry up or down in
the dialing directory with the up/down arrow keys or the k
and j keys. Press Enter or ESC to end moving the entry.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By pressing C-A
O you will be thrown into the setup menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filenames
and paths</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This menu defines your default
directories. <b><br>
A - Download directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where the downloaded files go
to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>B - Upload directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where the uploaded files are
read from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>C - Script directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Where you keep your login
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>D - Script program</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Which program to use as the
script interpreter. Defaults to the program
&quot;runscript&quot;, but if you want to use something else
(eg, /bin/sh or &quot;expect&quot;) it is possible. Stdin
and stdout are connected to the modem, stderr to the screen.
<br>
If the path is relative (ie, does not start with a slash)
then it&rsquo;s relative to your home directory, except for
the script interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>E - Kermit program</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Where to find the executable
for kermit, and it&rsquo;s options. Some simple
macro&rsquo;s can be used on the command line:
&rsquo;%l&rsquo; is expanded to the complete filename of the
dial out-device, &rsquo;%f&rsquo; is expanded to the serial
port file descriptor and &rsquo;%b&rsquo; is expanded to the
current serial port speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>F - Logging options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Options to configure the
logfile writing. <b><br>
A - File name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Here you can enter the name of
the logfile. The file will be written in your home
directory, and the default value is &quot;minicom.log&quot;.
If you blank the name, all logging is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>B - Log connects and
hangups</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">This option defines whether or
not the logfile is written when the remote end answers the
call or hangs up. Or when you give the hangup command
yourself or leave minicom without hangup while online.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>C - Log file
transfers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Do you want log entries of
receiving and sending files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The &rsquo;log&rsquo; command
in the scripts is not affected by logging options B and C.
It is always executed, if you just have the name of the log
file defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File
Transfer Protocols</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Protocols defined here will
show up when C-A s/r is pressed. &quot;Name&quot; in the
beginning of the line is the name that will show up in the
menu. &quot;Program&quot; is the path to the protocol.
&quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the program needs an
argument, e.g. a file to be transmitted. U/D defines if this
entry should show up in the upload or the download menu.
Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen, or
that minicom will only show it&rsquo;s stderr in a window.
IO-Red defines if minicom should attach the program&rsquo;s
standard in and output to the modem port or not.
&quot;Multi&quot; tells the filename selection window
whether or not the protocol can send multiple files with one
command. It has no effect on download protocols, and it is
also ignored with upload protocols if you don&rsquo;t use
the filename selection window. The old sz and rz are not
full screen, and have IO-Red set. However, there are curses
based versions of at least rz that do not want their stdin
and stdout redirected, and run full screen. All file
transfer protocols are run with the UID of the user, and not
with UID=root. &rsquo;%l&rsquo;, &rsquo;%f&rsquo; and
&rsquo;%b&rsquo; can be used on the command line as with
kermit. Within this menu you can also define if you want to
use the filename selection window when prompted for files to
upload, and if you like to be prompted for the download
directory every time the automatic download is started. If
you leave the download directory prompt disabled, the
download directory defined in the file and directory menu is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Serial port
setup</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>A - Serial device</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">/dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS1 for
most people. /dev/cua&lt;n&gt; is still possible under
GNU/Linux, but no longer recommended as these devices are
obsolete and many systems with kernel 2.2.x or newer
don&rsquo;t have them. Use /dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead. You
may also have /dev/modem as a symlink to the real device.
<br>
If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports,
you may specify all of them here in a list separated by
space, comma or semicolon. When Minicom starts, it checks
the list until it finds an available modem and uses that
one. (However, you can&rsquo;t specify different init
strings to them... at least not yet.) <br>
To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must
be prefixed with &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full
path and the filename of the socket. Minicom will then try
to connect to this socket as a client. As long as it cannot
connect to the socket it stays &rsquo;offline&rsquo;. As
soon as the connection establishes, minicom goes
&rsquo;online&rsquo;. If the server closes the socket,
minicom switches to &rsquo;offline&rsquo; again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>B - Lock file
location</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">On most systems This should be
/usr/spool/uucp. GNU/Linux systems use /var/lock. If this
directory does not exist, minicom will not attempt to use
lockfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>C - Callin program</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If you have a uugetty or
something on your serial port, it could be that you want a
program to be run to switch the modem cq. port into
dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get into dialin
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>D - Callout program</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">And this to get into dialout
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>E - Bps/Par/Bits</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default parameters at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If one of the
entries is left blank, it will not be used. So if you
don&rsquo;t care about locking, and don&rsquo;t have a getty
running on your modemline, entries B - D should be left
blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Modem and
Dialing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Here, the parameters for your
modem are defined. I will not explain this further because
the defaults are for generic Hayes modems, and should work
always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial :-) The only
things worth noticing are that control characters can be
sent by prefixing them with a &rsquo;^&rsquo;, in which
&rsquo;^^&rsquo; means &rsquo;^&rsquo; itself, and the
&rsquo;\&rsquo; character must also be doubled as
&rsquo;\\&rsquo;, because backslash is used specially in the
macro definitions. Some options however, don&rsquo;t have
much to do with the modem but more with the behaviour of
minicom itself: <b><br>
M - Dial time</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of seconds before
minicom times out if no connection is established.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>N - Delay before
redial</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Minicom will redial if no
connection was made, but it first waits some time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>O - Number of tries</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum number of times that
minicom attempts to dial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>P - Drop DTR time</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If you set this to 0, minicom
hangs up by sending a Hayes-type hangup sequence. If you
specify a non-zero value, the hangup will be done by
dropping the DTR line. The value tells in seconds how long
DTR will be kept down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>Q - Auto bps detect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this is on, minicom tries to
match the dialed party&rsquo;s speed. With most modern
modems this is NOT desirable, since the modem buffers the
data and converts the speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>R - Modem has DCD
line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If your modem, and your O/S
both support the DCD line (that goes &rsquo;high&rsquo; when
a connection is made) minicom will use it. When you have
this option on, minicom will also NOT start dialing while
you are already online.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>S - Status line shows DTE
speed / line speed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You can toggle the status line
to show either the DTE speed (the speed which minicom uses
to communicate with your modem) or the line speed (the speed
that your modem uses on the line to communicate with the
other modem). Notice that the line speed may change during
the connection, but you will still only see the initial
speed that the modems started the connection with. This is
because the modem doesn&rsquo;t tell the program if the
speed is changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to
have the modem set to show it in the connect string.
Otherwise you will only see 0 as the line speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>T - Multi-line untag</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You can toggle the feature to
untag entries from the dialing directory when a connection
is established to a multi-line BBS. All the tagged entries
that have the same name are untagged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that a
special exception is made for this menu: every user can
change all parameters here, but some of them will not be
saved.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Screen and
keyboard</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>A - Command key is</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">the &rsquo;Hot Key&rsquo; that
brings you into command mode. If this is set to
&rsquo;ALT&rsquo; or &rsquo;meta key&rsquo;, you can
directly call commands by alt-key instead of HotKey-key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>B - Backspace key
sends</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">There still are some systems
that want a VT100 to send DEL instead of BS. With this
option you can enable that stupidity. (Eh, it&rsquo;s even
on by default...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>C - Status line is</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enabled or disabled. Some slow
terminals (for example, X-terminals) cause the status line
to jump &quot;up and down&quot; when scrolling, so you can
turn it off if desired. It will still be shown in
command-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>D - Alarm sound</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If turned on, minicom will
sound an alarm (on the console only) after a successful
connection and when up/downloading is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>E - Foreground Color
(menu)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the foreground color
to use for all the configuration windows in minicom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>F - Background Color
(menu)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the background color
to use for all the configuration windows in minicom. Note
that minicom will not allow you to set foreground and
background colors to the same value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>G - Foreground Color
(term)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the foreground color
to use in the terminal window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>H - Background Color
(term)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the background color
to use in the terminal window. Note that minicom will not
allow you to set foreground and background colors to the
same value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>I - Foreground Color
(stat)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the foreground color
to use in for the status bar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>J - Background Color
(stat)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">indicates the color to use in
for the status bar. Note that minicom will allow you to set
the status bar&rsquo;s foreground and background colors to
the same value. This will effectively make the status bar
invisible but if these are your intentions, please see the
option</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>K - History buffer
size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of lines to keep in
the history buffer (for backscrolling).</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>L - Macros file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">is the full path to the file
that holds macros. Macros allow you to define a string to be
sent when you press a certain key. In minicom, you may
define F1 through F10 to send up to 256 characters [this is
set at compile time]. The filename you specify is verified
as soon as you hit ENTER. If you do not have permissions to
create the specified file, an error message will so indicate
and you will be forced to re-edit the filename. If you are
permitted to create the file, minicom checks to see if it
already exists. If so, it assumes it&rsquo;s a macro file
and reads it in. If it isn&rsquo;t, well, it&rsquo;s your
problem :-) If the file does not exist, the filename is
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>M - Edit Macros</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">opens up a new window which
allows you to edit the F1 through F10 macros.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>N - Macros enabled</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">- Yes or No. If macros are
disabled, the F1-F10 keys will just send the VT100/VT220
function key escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>O - Character
conversion</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The active conversion table
filename is shown here. If you can see no name, no
conversion is active. Pressing O, you will see the
conversion table edit menu. <b><br>
Edit Macros</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Here, the macros for F1 through
F10 are defined. The bottom of the window shows a legend of
character combinations that have special meaning. They allow
you to enter special control characters with plain text by
prefixing them with a &rsquo;^&rsquo;, in which
&rsquo;^^&rsquo; means &rsquo;^&rsquo; itself. You can send
a 1 second delay with the &rsquo;^~&rsquo; code. This is
useful when you are trying to login after ftp&rsquo;ing or
telnet&rsquo;ing somewhere. You can also include your
current username and password from the phone directory in
the macros with &rsquo;\u&rsquo; and &rsquo;\p&rsquo;,
respectively. If you need the backslash character in the
macro, write it doubled as &rsquo;\\&rsquo;. To edit a
macro, press the number (or letter for F10) and you will be
moved to the end of the macro. When editing the line, you
may use the left &amp; right arrows, Home &amp; End keys,
Delete &amp; BackSpace, and ESC and RETURN. ESC cancels any
changes made while ENTER accepts the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Character conversion</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Here you can edit the character
conversion table. If you are not an American, you know that
in many languages there are characters that are not included
in the ASCII character set, and in the old times they may
have replaced some less important characters in ASCII and
now they are often represented with character codes above
127. AND there are various different ways to represent them.
This is where you may edit conversion tables for systems
that use a character set different from the one on your
computer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>A - Load table</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">You probably guessed it. This
command loads a table from the disk. You are asked a file
name for the table. Predefined tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and
.mcsf7 should be included with the program. Table .mciso
does no conversion, .mcpc8 is to be used for connections
with systems that use the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7
is for compatibility with the systems that uses the good old
7-bit coding to replace the characters {|}[]\ with the
diacritical characters used in Finnish and Swedish.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>B - Save table</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">This one saves the active table
on the filename you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>C - edit char</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">This is where you can make your
own modifications to the existing table. First you are asked
the character value (in decimal) whose conversion you want
to change. Next you&rsquo;ll say which character you want to
see on your screen when that character comes from the
outside world. And then you&rsquo;ll be asked what you want
to be sent out when you enter that character from your
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>D - next screen <br>
E - prev screen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Yeah, you probably noticed that
this screen shows you what kind of conversions are active.
The screen just is (usually) too small to show the whole
table at once in an easy-to-understand format. This is how
you can scroll the table left and right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>F - convert capture</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Toggles whether or not the
character conversion table is used when writing the capture
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Save setup as dfl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Save the parameters as the
default for the next time the program is started. Instead of
dfl, any other parameter name may appear, depending on which
one was used when the program was started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Save setup as..</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Save the parameters under a
special name. Whenever Minicom is started with this name as
an argument, it will use these parameters. This option is of
course privileged to root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Exit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Escape from this menu without
saving. This can also be done with ESC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Exit from minicom</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Only root will see this menu
entry, if he/she started minicom with the
&rsquo;&minus;s&rsquo; option. This way, it is possible to
change the configuration without actually running
minicom.</p>

<h2>STATUS LINE
<a name="STATUS LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The status line
has several indicators, that speak for themselves. The
mysterious APP or NOR indicator probably needs explanation.
The VT100 cursor keys can be in two modes: applications mode
and cursor mode. This is controlled by an escape sequence.
If you find that the cursor keys do not work in, say, vi
when you&rsquo;re logged in using minicom then you can see
with this indicator whether the cursor keys are in
applications or cursor mode. You can toggle the two with the
C-A I key. If the cursor keys then work, it&rsquo;s probably
an error in the remote system&rsquo;s termcap initialization
strings (is).</p>

<h2>LOCALES
<a name="LOCALES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Minicom has
support for local languages. This means you can change most
of the English messages and other strings to another
language by setting the environment variable LANG.</p>

<h2>MISC
<a name="MISC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If minicom is
hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This means kill &minus;15, or
since sigterm is default, just plain &quot;kill
&lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;. This will cause a graceful exit of
minicom, doing resets and everything. You may kill minicom
from a script with the command &quot;! killall &minus;9
minicom&quot; without hanging up the line. Without the
&minus;9 parameter, minicom first hangs up before
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since a lot of
escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up is ESC [ A),
Minicom does not know if the escape character it gets is you
pressing the escape key, or part of a sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An old version
of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather crude way: to get
the escape key, you had to press it <i>twice</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of release
1.3 this has bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is
builtin, like in vi. For systems that have the select()
system call the timeout is 0.5 seconds. And... surprise: a
special Linux-dependent <b>hack</b> :-) was added. Now,
minicom can separate the escape key and escape-sequences. To
see how dirty this was done, look into wkeys.c. But it works
like a charm!</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Minicom keeps
it&rsquo;s configuration files in one directory, usually
/var/lib/minicom, /usr/local/etc or /etc. To find out what
default directory minicom has compiled in, issue the command
<i>minicom -h</i>. You&rsquo;ll probably also find the demo
files for <b>runscript</b>(1), and the examples of character
conversion tables either there or in the subdirectories of
/usr/doc/minicom*. The conversion tables are named something
like mc.* in that directory, but you probably want to copy
the ones you need in your home directory as something
beginning with a dot.</p>
