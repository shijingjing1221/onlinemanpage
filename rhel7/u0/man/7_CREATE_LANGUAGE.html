<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
LANGUAGE</b> registers a new procedural language with a
PostgreSQL database. Subsequently, functions and trigger
procedures can be defined in this new language.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
As of PostgreSQL 9.1, most procedural languages have been
made into &ldquo;extensions&rdquo;, and should therefore be
installed with CREATE EXTENSION (<b>CREATE_EXTENSION</b>(7))
not <b>CREATE LANGUAGE</b>. Direct use of <b>CREATE
LANGUAGE</b> should now be confined to extension
installation scripts. If you have a &ldquo;bare&rdquo;
language in your database, perhaps as a result of an
upgrade, you can convert it to an extension using CREATE
EXTENSION <i>langname</i> FROM unpackaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
LANGUAGE</b> effectively associates the language name with
handler function(s) that are responsible for executing
functions written in the language. Refer to Chapter 49,
Writing A Procedural Language Handler, in the documentation
for more information about language handlers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
forms of the <b>CREATE LANGUAGE</b> command. In the first
form, the user supplies just the name of the desired
language, and the PostgreSQL server consults the
pg_pltemplate system catalog to determine the correct
parameters. In the second form, the user supplies the
language parameters along with the language name. The second
form can be used to create a language that is not defined in
pg_pltemplate, but this approach is considered
obsolescent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the server
finds an entry in the pg_pltemplate catalog for the given
language name, it will use the catalog data even if the
command includes language parameters. This behavior
simplifies loading of old dump files, which are likely to
contain out&minus;of&minus;date information about language
support functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, the
user must have the PostgreSQL superuser privilege to
register a new language. However, the owner of a database
can register a new language within that database if the
language is listed in the pg_pltemplate catalog and is
marked as allowed to be created by database owners
(tmpldbacreate is true). The default is that trusted
languages can be created by database owners, but this can be
adjusted by superusers by modifying the contents of
pg_pltemplate. The creator of a language becomes its owner
and can later drop it, rename it, or assign it to a new
owner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE OR
REPLACE LANGUAGE</b> will either create a new language, or
replace an existing definition. If the language already
exists, its parameters are updated according to the values
specified or taken from pg_pltemplate, but the language's
ownership and permissions settings do not change, and any
existing functions written in the language are assumed to
still be valid. In addition to the normal privilege
requirements for creating a language, the user must be
superuser or owner of the existing language. The REPLACE
case is mainly meant to be used to ensure that the language
exists. If the language has a pg_pltemplate entry then
REPLACE will not actually change anything about an existing
definition, except in the unusual case where the
pg_pltemplate entry has been modified since the language was
created.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TRUSTED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">TRUSTED specifies that the
language does not grant access to data that the user would
not otherwise have. If this key word is omitted when
registering the language, only users with the PostgreSQL
superuser privilege can use this language to create new
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PROCEDURAL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a noise word.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the new procedural
language. The name must be unique among the languages in the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For backward
compatibility, the name can be enclosed by single
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HANDLER
<i>call_handler</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>call_handler</i> is the name
of a previously registered function that will be called to
execute the procedural language's functions. The call
handler for a procedural language must be written in a
compiled language such as C with version 1 call convention
and registered with PostgreSQL as a function taking no
arguments and returning the language_handler type, a
placeholder type that is simply used to identify the
function as a call handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">INLINE
<i>inline_handler</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>inline_handler</i> is the
name of a previously registered function that will be called
to execute an anonymous code block (<b>DO</b>(7) command) in
this language. If no <i>inline_handler</i> function is
specified, the language does not support anonymous code
blocks. The handler function must take one argument of type
internal, which will be the <b>DO</b> command's internal
representation, and it will typically return void. The
return value of the handler is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VALIDATOR
<i>valfunction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>valfunction</i> is the name
of a previously registered function that will be called when
a new function in the language is created, to validate the
new function. If no validator function is specified, then a
new function will not be checked when it is created. The
validator function must take one argument of type oid, which
will be the OID of the to&minus;be&minus;created function,
and will typically return void.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A validator
function would typically inspect the function body for
syntactical correctness, but it can also look at other
properties of the function, for example if the language
cannot handle certain argument types. To signal an error,
the validator function should use the <b>ereport()</b>
function. The return value of the function is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TRUSTED
option and the support function name(s) are ignored if the
server has an entry for the specified language name in
pg_pltemplate.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>createlang</b>(1) program is a simple wrapper around the
<b>CREATE LANGUAGE</b> command. It eases installation of
procedural languages from the shell command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use DROP
LANGUAGE (<b>DROP_LANGUAGE</b>(7)), or better yet the
<b>droplang</b>(1) program, to drop procedural
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system
catalog pg_language (see Section 45.27,
&ldquo;pg_language&rdquo;, in the documentation) records
information about the currently installed languages. Also,
<b>createlang</b> has an option to list the installed
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create
functions in a procedural language, a user must have the
USAGE privilege for the language. By default, USAGE is
granted to PUBLIC (i.e., everyone) for trusted languages.
This can be revoked if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Procedural
languages are local to individual databases. However, a
language can be installed into the template1 database, which
will cause it to be available automatically in all
subsequently&minus;created databases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The call
handler function, the inline handler function (if any), and
the validator function (if any) must already exist if the
server does not have an entry for the language in
pg_pltemplate. But when there is an entry, the functions
need not already exist; they will be automatically defined
if not present in the database. (This might result in
<b>CREATE LANGUAGE</b> failing, if the shared library that
implements the language is not available in the
installation.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In PostgreSQL
versions before 7.3, it was necessary to declare handler
functions as returning the placeholder type opaque, rather
than language_handler. To support loading of old dump files,
<b>CREATE LANGUAGE</b> will accept a function declared as
returning opaque, but it will issue a notice and change the
function's declared return type to language_handler.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The preferred
way of creating any of the standard procedural languages is
just:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE LANGUAGE
plperl;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a language
not known in the pg_pltemplate catalog, a sequence such as
this is needed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE FUNCTION
plsample_call_handler() RETURNS language_handler <br>
AS '$libdir/plsample' <br>
LANGUAGE C; <br>
CREATE LANGUAGE plsample <br>
HANDLER plsample_call_handler;</p>
