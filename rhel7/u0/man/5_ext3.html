<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second,
third, and fourth extended file systems, or ext2, ext3, and
ext4 as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that
have historically been the default file system for many
Linux distributions. They are general purpose file systems
that have been designed for extensibility and backwards
compatibility. In particular, file systems previously
intended for use with the ext2 and ext3 file systems can be
mounted using the ext4 file system driver, and indeed in
many modern Linux distributions, the ext4 file system driver
has been configured handle mount requests for ext2 and ext3
file systems.</p>

<h2>FILE SYSTEM FEATURES
<a name="FILE SYSTEM FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A file system
formated for ext2, ext3, or ext4 can be have some collection
of the follow file system feature flags enabled. Some of
these features are not supported by all implementations of
the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file system drivers, depending on
Linux kernel version in use. On other operating systems,
such as the GNU/HURD or FreeBSD, only a very restrictive set
of file system features may be supported in their
implementations of ext2.</p>

<p><b>64bit</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="60%">


<p>Enables the file system to be larger than 2^32 blocks.
This feature is set automatically, as needed, but it can be
useful to specify this feature explicitly if the file system
might need to be resized larger than 2^32 blocks, even if it
was smaller than that threshold when it was originally
created. Note that some older kernels and older versions of
e2fsprogs will not support file systems with this ext4
feature enabled.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>bigalloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature enables
clustered block allocation, so that the unit of allocation
is a power of two number of blocks. That is, each bit in the
what had traditionally been known as the block allocation
bitmap now indicates whether a cluster is in use or not,
where a cluster is by default composed of 16 blocks. This
feature can decrease the time spent on doing block
allocation and brings smaller fragmentation, especially for
large files. The size can be specified using the <b>&minus;C
option.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning:</b>
The bigalloc feature is still under development, and may not
be fully supported with your kernel or may have various
bugs. Please see the web page
http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Bigalloc for details.
May clash with delayed allocation (see
<b>nodelalloc</b>mount<b>option).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
requires that the <b>extent</b> features be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>dir_index</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">Use hashed b-trees to speed up
name lookups in large directories. This feature is supported
by ext3 and ext4 file systems, and is ignored by ext2 file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>dir_nlink</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows more
than 65000 subdirectories per directory.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="29%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>extent</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="60%">


<p>This ext4 feature allows the mapping of logical block
numbers for a particular inode to physical blocks on the
storage device to be stored using an extent tree, which is a
more efficient data structure than the traditional indirect
block scheme used by the ext2 and ext3 file systems. The use
of the extent tree decreases metadata block overhead,
improves file system performance, and decreases the needed
to run <b>e2fsck</b>(8) on the file system. (Note: both
<b>extent</b> and <b>extents</b> are accepted as valid names
for this feature for historical/backwards compatibility
reasons.)</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>extra_isize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature reserves a
specific amount of space in each inode for extended metadata
such as nanosecond timestamps and file creation time, even
if the current kernel does not current need to reserve this
much space. Without this feature, the kernel will reserve
the amount of space for features currently it currently
needs, and the rest may be consumed by extended
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">For this
feature to be useful the inode size must be 256 bytes in
size or larger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>ext_attr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature enables the use of
extended attributes. This feature is supported by ext2,
ext3, and ext4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>filetype</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature enables the
storage file type information in directory entries. This
feature is supported by ext2, ext3, and ext4.</p>


<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em"><b>flex_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows the
per-block group metadata (allocation bitmaps and inode
tables) to be placed anywhere on the storage media. In
addition, <b>mke2fs</b> will place the per-block group
metadata together starting at the first block group of each
&quot;flex_bg group&quot;. The size of the flex_bg group can
be specified using the <b>&minus;G</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>has_journal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">Create a journal to ensure
filesystem consistency even across unclean shutdowns.
Setting the filesystem feature is equivalent to using the
<b>&minus;j</b> option. This feature is supported by ext3
and ext4, and ignored by the ext2 file system driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>huge_file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows files
to be larger than 2 terabytes in size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>journal_dev</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature is enabled on the
superblock found on an external journal device. The block
size for the external journal must be the same as the file
system which uses it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">The external
journal device can be used by a file system by specifying
the <b>&minus;J device=</b>&lt;external-device&gt; option to
<b>mke2fs</b>(8) or <b>tune2fs(8).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>large_file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature flag is set
automatically by modern kernels when a file larger than 2
gigabytes is created. Very old kernels could not handle
large files, so this feature flag was used to prohibit those
kernels from mounting file systems that they could not
understand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>meta_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows file
systems to be resized on-line without explicitly needing to
reserve space for growth in the size of the block group
descriptors. This scheme is also used to resize file systems
which are larger than 2^32 blocks. It is not recommended
that this feature be set when a file system is created,
since this alternate method of storing the block group
descriptor will slow down the time needed to mount the file
system, and newer kernels can automatically set this feature
as necessary when doing an online resize and no more
reserved space is available in the resize inode.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="29%"></td>
<td width="5%">


<p><b>mmp</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="51%">


<p>This ext4 feature provides multiple mount protection
(MMP). MMP helps to protect the filesystem from being
multiply mounted and is useful in shared storage
environments.</p> </td>
<td width="9%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>resize_inode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This file system feature
indicates that space has been reserved so the block group
descriptor table can be extended by the file system is
resized while the file system is mounted. The online resize
operation is carried out by the kernel, triggered, by
<b>resize2fs</b>(8). By default <b>mke2fs</b> will attempt
to reserve enough space so that the filesystem may grow to
1024 times its initial size. This can be changed using the
<b>resize</b> extended option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
requires that the <b>sparse_super</b> feature be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>sparse_super</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This file system feature is set
on all modern ext2, ext3, and ext4 file system. It indicates
that backup copies of the superblock and block group
descriptors be present only on a few block groups, and not
all of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>uninit_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 file system feature
indicates that the block group descriptors will be protected
using checksums, making it safe for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to
create a file system without initializing all of the block
groups. The kernel will keep a high watermark of unused
inodes, and initialize inode tables and block lazily. This
feature speeds up the time to check the file system using
<b>e2fsck</b>(8), and it also speeds up the time required
for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to create the file system.</p>
