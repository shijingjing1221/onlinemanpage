<h2>STATE MAINTENANCE OVERVIEW
<a name="STATE MAINTENANCE OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<small>HTTP</small> is a stateless protocol, each subsequent
click to a web site is treated as new request by the Web
server. The server does not relate a visit with a previous
one, thus all the state information from the previous
requests are lost. This makes creating such applications as
shopping carts, web sites requiring users to authenticate,
impossible. So people had to do something about this despair
situation <small>HTTP</small> was putting us in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For our rescue
come such technologies as <i><small>HTTP</small> Cookies</i>
and <i><small>QUERY_STRING</small></i> s that help us save
the users&rsquo; session for a certain period. Since
<i><small>HTTP</small> Cookies</i> and
<i><small>QUERY_STRING</small></i> s alone cannot take us
too far ( <b><small>RFC 2965,</small> Section 5,
&quot;Implementation Limitations&quot;</b>), several other
libraries have been developed to extend their capabilities
and promise a more reliable solution. CGI::Session is one of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before we
discuss this library, let&rsquo;s look at some alternative
solutions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>COOKIE</small></b>
<br>
Cookie is a piece of text-information that a web server is
entitled to place in the user&rsquo;s hard disk, assuming a
user agent (such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla, etc) is
compatible with the specification. After the cookie is
placed, user agents are required to send these cookies back
to the server as part of the <small>HTTP</small> request.
This way the server application ( <small>CGI,</small> for
example ) will have a way of relating previous requests by
the same user agent, thus overcoming statelessness of
<small>HTTP.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
<i><small>HTTP</small> Cookies</i> seem to be promising
solution for the statelessness of <small>HTTP,</small> they
do carry certain limitations, such as limited number of
cookies per domain and per user agent and limited size on
each cookie. User Agents are required to store at least 300
cookies at a time, 20 cookies per domain and allow 4096
bytes of storage for each cookie. They also rise several
Privacy and Security concerns, the lists of which can be
found on the sections <b>6&minus;&quot;Privacy&quot;</b> and
<b>7&minus;&quot;Security Considerations&quot;</b> of
<b><small>RFC 2965</small></b> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>QUERY
STRING</small></b> <br>
Query string is a string appended to <small>URL</small>
following a question mark (?) such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    http://my.dot.com/login.cgi?user=sherzodr;password=top&minus;secret</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you probably
guessed, it can also help you pass state information from a
click to another, but how secure is it do you think,
considering these URLs tend to get cached by most of the
user agents and also logged in the servers access log, to
which everyone can have access.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>HIDDEN
FIELDS</small></b> <br>
Hidden field is another alternative to using query strings
and they come in two flavors: hidden fields used in
<small>POST</small> methods and the ones in
<small>GET.</small> The ones used in <small>GET</small>
methods will turn into a true query strings once submitted,
so all the disadvantages of QUERY_STRINGs apply. Although
<small>POST</small> requests do not have limitations of its
sister-GET, the pages that hold them get cached by Web
browser, and are available within the source code of the
page (obviously). They also become unwieldily to manage when
one has oodles of state information to keep track of ( for
instance, a shopping cart or an advanced search engine).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Query strings
and hidden fields are also lost easily by closing the
browser, or by clicking the browser&rsquo;s &quot;Back&quot;
button.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SERVER
SIDE SESSION MANAGEMENT</small></b> <br>
This technique is built upon the aforementioned technologies
plus a server-side storage device, which saves the state
data on the server side. Each session has a unique id
associated with the data in the server. This id is also
associated with the user agent either in the form of a
<i><small>HTTP</small> Cookie</i>, a
<i><small>QUERY_STRING</small></i> , hidden field or any
combination of the above. This is necessary to make the
connection with the client and his data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Advantages:</p>

<p>Sensitive data no longer need to be traveling across the
network at each request (which is the case with query
strings, cookies and hidden fields). The only thing that
travels is the unique id generated for the session
(<b>5767393932698093d0b75ef614376314</b>, for instance),
which should make no sense to third parties.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s
what CGI::Session is all about &minus; implementing server
side session management. Now is a good time to get feet
wet.</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMING STYLE
<a name="PROGRAMMING STYLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Server side
session management system might be seeming awfully
convoluted if you have never dealt with it. Fortunately,
with CGI::Session all the complexity is handled by the
library transparently. This section of the manual can be
treated as an introductory tutorial to both logic behind
session management, and to CGI::Session programming
style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All
applications making use of server side session management
rely on the following pattern of operation regardless of the
way the system is implemented:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check if the user has session
cookie dropped in his computer from previous request</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the cookie does not exist, create a new session
identifier, and drop it as cookie to the user&rsquo;s
computer.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If session cookie exists, read the session
<small>ID</small> from the cookie and load any previously
saved session data from the server side storage. If session
had any expiration date set it&rsquo;s useful to re-drop the
same cookie to the user&rsquo;s computer so its expiration
time will be reset to be relative to user&rsquo;s last
activity time.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Store any necessary data in the session that you want to
make available for the next <small>HTTP</small> request.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CGI::Session
will handle all of the above steps. All you have to do is to
choose what to store in the session.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>GETTING
STARTED</small></b> <br>
To make CGI::Session&rsquo;s functionality available in your
program do either of the following somewhere on top of your
program file:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use CGI::Session;
    # or
    require CGI::Session;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever
you&rsquo;re ready to create a new session in your
application, do the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session = new CGI::Session() or die CGI::Session&minus;&gt;errstr;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Above line will
first try to re-initialize an existing session by consulting
cookies and necessary <small>QUERY_STRING</small>
parameters. If it fails will create a brand new session with
a unique <small>ID,</small> which is normally called
<i>session <small>ID</small></i> , <i><small>SID</small></i>
for short, and can be accessed through <i>id()</i> &minus;
object method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We didn&rsquo;t
check for any session cookies above, did we? No, we
didn&rsquo;t, but CGI::Session did. It looked for a cookie
called <tt>&quot;CGISESSID&quot;</tt>, and if it found it
tried to load existing session from server side storage
(<b>file</b> in our case). If cookie didn&rsquo;t exist it
looked for a <small>QUERY_STRING</small> parameter called
<tt>&quot;CGISESSID&quot;</tt>. If all the attempts to
recover session <small>ID</small> failed, it created a new
session.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
For the above syntax to work as intended your application
needs to have write access to your computer&rsquo;s
<i><small>TEMPDIR</small></i> folder, which is usually
<i>/tmp</i> in <small>UNIX.</small> If it doesn&rsquo;t, or
if you wish to store this application&rsquo;s session files
in a different place, you may pass the third argument like
so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session = new CGI::Session(undef, undef, {Directory=&gt;'../tmp/sessions'});</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now it will
store all the newly created sessions in (and will attempt to
initialize requested sessions from) that folder. Don&rsquo;t
worry if the directory hierarchy you want to use
doesn&rsquo;t already exist. It will be created for you. For
details on how session data are stored refer to
CGI::Session::Driver::file, which is the default driver used
in our above example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
small, but very important thing your application needs to
perform after creating CGI::Session object as above. It
needs to drop Session <small>ID</small> as an
<i><small>HTTP</small> cookie</i> into the user&rsquo;s
computer. CGI::Session will use this cookie to identify the
user at his/her next request and will be able to load
his/her previously stored session data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make sure
CGI::Session will be able to read your cookie at next
request you need to consult its <tt>&quot;name()&quot;</tt>
method for cookie&rsquo;s suggested name:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $cookie = $query&minus;&gt;cookie( &minus;name   =&gt; $session&minus;&gt;name,
                              &minus;value  =&gt; $session&minus;&gt;id );
    print $query&minus;&gt;header( &minus;cookie=&gt;$cookie );</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;name()&quot;
returns <tt>&quot;CGISESSID&quot;</tt> by default. If you
prefer a different cookie name, you can change it as easily
too, but you have to do it before CGI::Session object is
created:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    CGI::Session&minus;&gt;name(&quot;SID&quot;);
    $session = new CGI::Session();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Baking the
cookie wasn&rsquo;t too difficult, was it? But there is an
even easier way to send a cookie using CGI::Session:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print $session&minus;&gt;header();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above will
create the cookie using CGI::Cookie and will return proper
http headers using <small>CGI</small> .pm&rsquo;s
<small>CGI</small> method. Any arguments to CGI::Session
will be passed to <i>CGI::header()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course, this
method of initialization will only work if client is
accepting cookies. If not you would have to pass session
<small>ID</small> in each <small>URL</small> of your
application as <small>QUERY_STRING.</small> For CGI::Session
to detect it the name of the parameter should be the same as
returned by <i>name()</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    printf (&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;$ENV{SCRIPT_NAME}?%s=%s\&quot;&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, $session&minus;&gt;name, $session&minus;&gt;id);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you already
have session id to be initialized you may pass it as the
only argument, or the second argument of multi-argument
syntax:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session = new CGI::Session( $sid );
    $session = new CGI::Session( &quot;serializer:freezethaw&quot;, $sid );
    $session = new CGI::Session( &quot;driver:mysql&quot;, $sid, {Handle=&gt;$dbh} );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default
CGI::Session uses standard <small>CGI</small> to parse
queries and cookies. If you prefer to use a different, but
compatible object you can pass that object in place of
<tt>$sid:</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>$cgi = new
CGI::Simple(); <br>
$session = new CGI::Session ( $cgi ); <br>
$session = new CGI::Session(
&quot;driver:db_file;serializer:storable&quot;, $cgi); <br>
# etc</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
CGI::Simple</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>STORING
DATA</small></b> <br>
CGI::Session offers <i>param()</i> method, which behaves
exactly as <small>CGI</small> .pm&rsquo;s <i>param()</i>
with identical syntax. <i>param()</i> is used for storing
data in session as well as for accessing already stored
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Imagine your
customer submitted a login form on your Web site. You, as a
good host, wanted to remember the guest&rsquo;s name, so you
can a) greet him accordingly when he visits your site again,
or b) to be helpful by filling out <i>user name</i> part of
his login form, so the customer can jump right to the
<i>password</i> field without having to type his username
again.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $name = $cgi&minus;&gt;param('username');
    $session&minus;&gt;param('username', $name);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice,
we&rsquo;re grabbing <i>username</i> value of the field
using <small>CGI</small> .pm&rsquo;s (or another compatible
library&rsquo;s) <tt>&quot;param()&quot;</tt> method, and
storing it in session using CGI::Session&rsquo;s
<i>param()</i> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have too
many stuff to transfer into session, you may find yourself
typing the above code over and over again. I&rsquo;ve done
it, and believe me, it gets very boring too soon, and is
also error-prone. So we introduced the following handy
method:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;save_param(['name']);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wanted
to store multiple form fields just include them all in the
second list:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;save_param(['name', 'email']);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
store all the available <i><small>QUERY_STRING</small></i>
parameters you can omit the arguments:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;save_param();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>save_param()</i> for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When storing
data in the session you&rsquo;re not limited to strings. You
can store arrays, hashes and even most objects. You will
need to pass them as references (except objects).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
get all the selected values of a scrolling list and store it
in the session:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my @fruits = $cgi&minus;&gt;param('fruits');
    $session&minus;&gt;param('fruits', \@fruits);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For parameters
with multiple values <i>save_param()</i> will do the right
thing too. So the above is the same as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;save_param($cgi, ['fruits']);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the updates
to the session data using above methods will not reflect in
the data store until your application exits, or
<tt>$session</tt> goes out of scope. If, for some reason,
you need to commit the changes to the data store before your
application exits you need to call <i>flush()</i>
method:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;flush();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;ve
written a lot of code, and never felt need for using
<tt>&quot;flush()&quot;</tt> method, since CGI::Session
calls this method at the end of each request. There are,
however, occasions I can think of one may need to call
<i>flush()</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ACCESSING
STORED DATA</small></b> <br>
There&rsquo;s no point of storing data if you cannot access
it. You can access stored session data by using the same
<i>param()</i> method you once used to store them. Remember
the Username field from the previous section that we stored
in the session? Let&rsquo;s read it back so we can partially
fill the Login form for the user:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $name = $session&minus;&gt;param(&quot;name&quot;);
    printf &quot;&lt;input type=\&quot;text\&quot; name=\&quot;name\&quot; value=\&quot;%s\&quot; /&gt;&quot;, $name;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To retrieve
previously stored <tt>@fruits</tt> do not forget to de
reference it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @fruits = @{ $session&minus;&gt;param('fruits') };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Very
frequently, you may find yourself having to create
pre-filled and pre-selected forms, like radio buttons,
checkboxes and drop down menus according to the user&rsquo;s
preferences or previous action. With text and textareas
it&rsquo;s not a big deal &minus; you can simply retrieve a
single parameter from the session and hard code the value
into the text field. But how would you do it when you have a
group of radio buttons, checkboxes and scrolling lists? For
this purpose, CGI::Session provides <i>load_param()</i>
method, which loads given session parameters to a
<small>CGI</small> object (assuming they have been
previously saved with <i>save_param()</i> or
alternative):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;load_param($cgi, [&quot;fruits&quot;]);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now when you
say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print $cgi&minus;&gt;checkbox_group(fruits=&gt;['apple', 'banana', 'apricot']);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>load_param()</i> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generated
checkboxes will be pre-filled using previously saved
information. To see example of a real session-powered
application consider
http://handalak.com/cgi&minus;bin/subscriptions.cgi</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
making use of HTML::Template to separate the code from the
skin, you can as well associate CGI::Session object with
HTML::Template and access all the parameters from within
<small>HTML</small> files. We love this trick!</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $template = new HTML::Template(filename=&gt;&quot;some.tmpl&quot;, associate=&gt;$session);
    print $template&minus;&gt;output();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming the
session object stored &quot;first_name&quot; and
&quot;email&quot; parameters while being associated with
HTML::Template, you can access those values from within your
&quot;some.tmpl&quot; file now:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Hello &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&lt;TMPL_VAR email&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;TMPL_VAR first_name&gt; &lt;/a&gt;!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
HTML::Template&rsquo;s online manual for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>CLEARING
SESSION DATA</small></b> <br>
You store session data, you access session data and at some
point you will want to clear certain session data, if not
all. For this purpose CGI::Session provides <i>clear()</i>
method which optionally takes one argument as an arrayref
indicating which session parameters should be deleted from
the session object:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;clear([&quot;~logged&minus;in&quot;, &quot;email&quot;]);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Above line
deletes &quot;~logged&minus;in&quot; and &quot;email&quot;
session parameters from the session. And next time you
say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $email = $session&minus;&gt;param(&quot;email&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">it returns
undef. If you omit the argument to <i>clear()</i>, be warned
that all the session parameters you ever stored in the
session object will get deleted. Note that it does not
delete the session itself. Session stays open and
accessible. It&rsquo;s just the parameters you stored in it
gets deleted</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>clear()</i> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>DELETING
A SESSION</small></b> <br>
If there&rsquo;s a start there&rsquo;s an end. If session
could be created, it should be possible to delete it from
the disk for good:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;delete();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above call
to <i>delete()</i> deletes the session from the disk for
good. Do not confuse it with <i>clear()</i>, which only
clears certain session parameters but keeps the session
open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>delete()</i> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>EXPIRATION</small></b>

CGI::Session provides limited means to expire sessions.
Expiring a session is the same as deleting it via
<i>delete()</i>, but deletion takes place automatically. To
expire a session, you need to tell the library how long the
session would be valid after the last access time. When that
time is met, CGI::Session refuses to retrieve the session.
It deletes the session and returns a brand new one. To
assign expiration ticker for a session, use
<i>expire()</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;expire(3600);     # expire after 3600 seconds
    $session&minus;&gt;expire('+1h');    # expire after 1 hour
    $session&minus;&gt;expire('+15m');   # expire after 15 minutes
    $session&minus;&gt;expire('+1M');    # expire after a month and so on.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When session is
set to expire at some time in the future, but session was
not requested at or after that time has passed it will
remain in the disk. When expired session is requested
CGI::Session will remove the data from disk, and will
initialize a brand new session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>expire()</i> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
CGI::Session 4.x there was no way of intercepting requests
to expired sessions. CGI::Session 4.x introduced new kind of
constructor, <i>load()</i>, which is identical in use to
<i>new()</i>, but is not allowed to create sessions. It can
only load them. If session is found to be expired, or
session does not exist it will return an empty CGI::Session
object. And if session is expired, in addition to being
empty, its status will also be set to expired. You can check
against these conditions using <i>empty()</i> and
<i>is_expired()</i> methods. If session was loaded
successfully object returned by <tt>&quot;load()&quot;</tt>
is as good a session as the one returned by
<tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session = CGI::Session&minus;&gt;load() or die CGI::Session&minus;&gt;errstr;
    if ( $session&minus;&gt;is_expired ) {
        die &quot;Your session expired. Please refresh your browser to re&minus;start your session&quot;;
    }
    if ( $session&minus;&gt;is_empty ) {
        $session = $session&minus;&gt;new();
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Above example
is worth an attention. Remember, all expired sessions are
empty sessions, but not all empty sessions are expired
sessions. Following this rule we have to check with
<tt>&quot;is_expired()&quot;</tt> before checking with
<tt>&quot;is_empty()&quot;</tt>. There is another thing
about the above example. Notice how its creating new session
when un existing session was requested? By calling
<tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt> as an object method! Handy thing
about that is, when you call <tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt> on a
session object new object will be created using the same
configuration as the previous object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session = CGI::Session&minus;&gt;load(&quot;driver:mysql;serializer:storable&quot;, undef, {Handle=&gt;$dbh});
    if ( $session&minus;&gt;is_expired ) {
        die &quot;Your session is expired. Please refresh your browser to re&minus;start your session&quot;;
    }
    if ( $session&minus;&gt;is_empty ) {
        $session = $session&minus;&gt;new();
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initial
<tt>$session</tt> object was configured with <b>mysql</b> as
the driver, <b>storable</b> as the serializer and
<b>$dbh</b> as the database handle. Calling <tt>&quot; new()
&quot;</tt> on this object will return an object of the same
configuration. So <tt>$session</tt> object returned from
<tt>&quot; new() &quot;</tt> in the above example will use
<b>mysql</b> as the driver, <b>storable</b> as the
serializer and <b>$dbh</b> as the database handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>is_expired()</i>, <i>is_empty()</i>, <i>load()</i> for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it
makes perfect sense to expire a certain session parameter,
instead of the whole session. I usually do this in my login
enabled sites, where after the user logs in successfully, I
set his/her &quot;_logged_in&quot; session parameter to
true, and assign an expiration ticker on that flag to
something like 30 minutes. It means, after 30 idle minutes
CGI::Session will clear &quot;_logged_in&quot; flag,
indicating the user should log in over again. I agree, the
same effect can be achieved by simply <i>expiring()</i> the
session itself, but by doing this we would loose other
session parameters, such as user&rsquo;s shopping cart,
session-preferences and the like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
can also be used to simulate layered authentication, such
as, you can keep the user&rsquo;s access to his/her personal
profile information for as long as 60 minutes after a
successful login, but expire his/her access to his credit
card information after 5 idle minutes. To achieve this
effect, we will use <i>expire()</i> method again:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $session&minus;&gt;expire(_profile_access, '1h');
    $session&minus;&gt;expire(_cc_access, '5m');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the above
syntax, the person will still have access to his personal
information even after 5 idle hours. But when he tries to
access or update his/her credit card information, he may be
displayed a &quot;login again, please&quot; screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i>expire()</i> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This concludes
our discussion of CGI::Session programming style. The rest
of the manual covers some &quot;
<small>SECURITY&quot;</small> issues. Driver specs from the
previous manual were moved to CGI::Session::Driver.</p>

<h2>SECURITY
<a name="SECURITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;How
secure is using CGI::Session?&quot;, &quot;Can others hack
down people&rsquo;s sessions using another browser if they
can get the session id of the user?&quot;, &quot;Are the
session ids easy to guess?&quot; are the questions I find
myself answering over and over again.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>STORAGE</small></b>
<br>
Security of the library does in many aspects depend on the
implementation. After making use of this library, you no
longer have to send all the information to the user&rsquo;s
cookie except for the session id. But, you still have to
store the data in the server side. So another set of
questions arise, can an evil person get access to session
data in your server, even if he does, can he make sense out
of the data in the session file, and even if he can, can he
reuse the information against a person who created that
session. As you see, the answer depends on yourself who is
implementing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">First rule of thumb, do not
store users&rsquo; passwords or other sensitive data in the
session, please. If you have to, use one-way encryption,
such as md5, or <small>SHA&minus;1&minus;1.</small> For my
own experience I can assure you that in properly implemented
session-powered Web applications there is never a need for
it.</p> </td></tr>

<p>Default configuration of the driver makes use of
Data::Dumper class to serialize data to make it possible to
save it in the disk. Data::Dumper&rsquo;s result is a human
readable data structure, which, if opened, can be
interpreted easily. If you configure your session object to
use either Storable or FreezeThaw as a serializer, this
would make it more difficult for bad guys to make sense out
of session data. But don&rsquo;t use this as the only
precaution. Since evil fingers can type a quick program
using Storable or FreezeThaw to decipher session files very
easily.</p> </td></tr>

<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Do not allow anyone to update contents of session files.
If you&rsquo;re using default serializer serialized data
string needs to be <i>eval()</i>ed to bring the original
data structure back to life. Of course, we use Safe to do it
safely, but your cautiousness does no harm either.</p></td></tr>

<p>Do not keep sessions open for very long. This will
increase the possibility that some bad guy may have
someone&rsquo;s valid session id at a given time (acquired
somehow). To do this use <i>expire()</i> method to set
expiration ticker. The more sensitive the information on
your Web site is, the sooner the session should be set to
expire.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SESSION</small>
IDs</b> <br>
Session ids are not easily guessed (unless you&rsquo;re
using incr <small>ID</small> generator)! Default
configuration of CGI::Session uses Digest::MD5 to generate
random, 32 character long identifier. Although this string
cannot be guessed as easily by others, if they find it out
somehow, can they use this identifier against the other
person?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider the
scenario, where you just give someone either via email or an
instant messaging a link to a Web site where you&rsquo;re
currently logged in. The <small>URL</small> you give to that
person contains a session id as part of a query string. If
the site was initializing the session solely using query
string parameter, after clicking on that link that person
now appears to that site as you, and might have access to
all of your private data instantly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even if
you&rsquo;re solely using cookies as the session id
transporters, it&rsquo;s not that difficult to plant a
cookie in the cookie file with the same id and trick the web
browser to send that particular session id to the server. So
key for security is to check if the person who&rsquo;s
asking us to retrieve a session data is indeed the person
who initially created the session data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One way to help
with this is by also checking that the <small>IP</small>
address that the session is being used from is always same.
However, this turns out not to be practical in common cases
because some large ISPs (such as <small>AOL</small> ) use
proxies which cause each and every request from the same
user to come from different <small>IP</small> address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have an
application where you are sure your users&rsquo; IPs are
constant during a session, you can consider enabling an
option to make this check:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use CGI::Session ( '&minus;ip_match' );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For backwards
compatibility, you can also achieve this by setting
<tt>$CGI::Session::IP_MATCH</tt> to a true value. This makes
sure that before initializing a previously stored session,
it checks if the ip address stored in the session matches
the ip address of the user asking for that session. In which
case the library returns the session, otherwise it dies with
a proper error message.</p>
