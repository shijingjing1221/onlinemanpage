<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bazaar (or bzr)
is a distributed version control system that is powerful,
friendly, and scalable. Bazaar is a project of Canonical Ltd
and part of the GNU Project to develop a free operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bazaar keeps
track of changes to software source code (or similar
information); lets you explore who changed it, when, and
why; merges concurrent changes; and helps people work
together in a team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
non&minus;recursive mode, all the named items are added,
regardless of whether they were previously ignored. A
warning is given if any of the named files are already
versioned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In recursive
mode (the default), files are treated the same way but the
behaviour for directories is different. Directories that are
already versioned do not give a warning. All directories,
whether already versioned or not, are searched for files or
subdirectories that are neither versioned or ignored, and
these are added. This search proceeds recursively into
versioned directories. If no names are given &acute;.&acute;
is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A warning will
be printed when nested trees are encountered, unless they
are explicitly ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore
simply saying &acute;bzr add&acute; will version all files
that are currently unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adding a file
whose parent directory is not versioned will implicitly add
the parent, and so on up to the root. This means you should
never need to explicitly add a directory, they&acute;ll just
get added when you add a file in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;file&minus;ids&minus;from
will try to use the file ids from the supplied path. It
looks up ids trying to find a matching parent directory with
the same filename, and then by pure path. This option is
rarely needed but can be useful when adding the same logical
file into two branches that will be merged later (without
showing the two different adds as a conflict). It is also
useful when merging another project into a subdirectory of
this one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any files
matching patterns in the ignore list will not be added
unless they are explicitly mentioned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In recursive

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Commit changes
into a new revision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An explanatory
message needs to be given for each commit. This is often
done by using the &minus;&minus;message option (getting the
message from the command line) or by using the
&minus;&minus;file option (getting the message from a file).
If neither of these options is given, an editor is opened
for the user to enter the message. To see the changed files
in the boilerplate text loaded into the editor, use the
&minus;&minus;show&minus;diff option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
entire tree is committed and the person doing the commit is
assumed to be the author. These defaults can be overridden
as explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Selective
commits:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If selected
files are specified, only changes to those files are <br>
committed. If a directory is specified then the directory
and <br>
everything within it is committed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When excludes
are given, they take precedence over selected files. <br>
For example, to commit only changes within foo, but not
changes <br>
within foo/bar:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bzr commit foo
&minus;x foo/bar</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A selective

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Custom
authors:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the author
of the change is not the same person as the committer, <br>
you can specify the author&acute;s name using the
&minus;&minus;author option. The <br>
name should be in the same format as a committer&minus;id,
e.g. <br>
&quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@example.com&gt;&quot;. If there is
more than one author of <br>
the change you can specify the option multiple times, once
for each <br>
author.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Checks:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A common
mistake is to forget to add a new file or directory before
<br>
running the commit command. The &minus;&minus;strict option
checks for unknown <br>
files and aborts the commit if any are found. More advanced
pre&minus;commit <br>
checks can be implemented by defining hooks. See ``bzr help
hooks`` <br>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Things to
note:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
accidentially commit the wrong changes or make a spelling
<br>
mistake in the commit message say, you can use the uncommit
command <br>
to undo it. See ``bzr help uncommit`` for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hooks can also
be configured to run after a commit. This allows you <br>
to trigger updates to external systems like bug trackers.
The &minus;&minus;fixes <br>
option can be used to record the association between a
revision and <br>
one or more bugs. See ``bzr help bugs`` for details.</p>

log for a branch or subset of a branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">log is
bzr&acute;s default tool for exploring the history of a
branch. The branch to use is taken from the first parameter.
If no parameters are given, the branch containing the
working directory is logged. Here are some simple
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bzr log log the
current branch <br>
bzr log foo.py log a file in its branch <br>
bzr log http://server/branch log a branch on a server</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filtering,
ordering and information shown for each revision can be
controlled as explained below. By default, all revisions are
shown sorted (topologically) so that newer revisions appear
before older ones and descendants always appear before
ancestors. If displayed, merged revisions are shown indented
under the revision in which they were merged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Output
control:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The log format
controls how information about each revision is <br>
displayed. The standard log formats are called ``long``,
``short`` <br>
and ``line``. The default is long. See ``bzr help
log&minus;formats`` <br>
for more details on log formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options can be used to control what information is <br>
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;l N
display a maximum of N revisions <br>
&minus;n N display N levels of revisions (0 for all, 1 for
collapsed) <br>
&minus;v display a status summary (delta) for each revision
<br>
&minus;p display a diff (patch) for each revision <br>
&minus;&minus;show&minus;ids display revision&minus;ids (and
file&minus;ids), not just revnos</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
default number of levels to display is a function of the
<br>
log format. If the &minus;n option is not used, the standard
log formats show <br>
just the top level (mainline).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Status
summaries are shown using status flags like A, M, etc. To
see <br>
the changes explained using words like ``added`` and
``modified`` <br>
instead, use the &minus;vv option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ordering
control:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To display
revisions from oldest to newest, use the
&minus;&minus;forward option. <br>
In most cases, using this option will have little impact on
the total <br>
time taken to produce a log, though &minus;&minus;forward
does not incrementally <br>
display revisions like &minus;&minus;reverse does when it
can.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Revision
filtering:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;r
option can be used to specify what revision or range of
revisions <br>
to filter against. The various forms are shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;rX
display revision X <br>
&minus;rX.. display revision X and later <br>
&minus;r..Y display up to and including revision Y <br>
&minus;rX..Y display from X to Y inclusive</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See ``bzr help
revisionspec`` for details on how to specify X and Y. <br>
Some common examples are given below:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;r&minus;1
show just the tip <br>
&minus;r&minus;10.. show the last 10 mainline revisions <br>
&minus;rsubmit:.. show what&acute;s new on this branch <br>
&minus;rancestor:path.. show changes since the common
ancestor of this <br>
branch and the one at location path <br>
&minus;rdate:yesterday.. show changes since yesterday</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When logging a
range of revisions using &minus;rX..Y, log starts at <br>
revision Y and searches back in history through the primary
<br>
(&quot;left&minus;hand&quot;) parents until it finds X. When
logging just the <br>
top level (using &minus;n1), an error is reported if X is
not found <br>
along the way. If multi&minus;level logging is used
(&minus;n0), X may be <br>
a nested merge revision and the log will be truncated
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Path
filtering:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If parameters
are given and the first one is not a branch, the log <br>
will be filtered to show only those revisions that changed
the <br>
nominated files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Filenames are
interpreted within their historical context. To log a <br>
deleted file, specify a revision range so that the file
existed at <br>
the end or start of the range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
context is also important when interpreting pathnames of
<br>
renamed files/directories. Consider the following
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* revision 1:
add tutorial.txt <br>
* revision 2: modify tutorial.txt <br>
* revision 3: rename tutorial.txt to guide.txt; add
tutorial.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
case:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* ``bzr log
guide.txt`` will log the file added in revision 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* ``bzr log
tutorial.txt`` will log the new file added in revision 3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* ``bzr log
&minus;r2 &minus;p tutorial.txt`` will show the changes made
to <br>
the original file in revision 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* ``bzr log
&minus;r2 &minus;p guide.txt`` will display an error message
as there <br>
was no file called guide.txt in revision 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Renames are
always followed by log. By design, there is no need to <br>
explicitly ask for this (and no way to stop logging a file
back <br>
until it was last renamed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other
filtering:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&minus;&minus;match option can be used for finding revisions
that match a <br>
regular expression in a commit message, committer, author or
bug. <br>
Specifying the option several times will match any of the
supplied <br>
expressions. &minus;&minus;match&minus;author,
&minus;&minus;match&minus;bugs,
&minus;&minus;match&minus;committer and <br>
&minus;&minus;match&minus;message can be used to only match
a specific field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tips &amp;
tricks:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GUI tools and
IDEs are often better at exploring history than command <br>
line tools: you may prefer qlog or viz from qbzr or
bzr&minus;gtk, the <br>
bzr&minus;explorer shell, or the Loggerhead web interface.
See the Plugin <br>
Guide &lt;http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/&gt;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may find it
useful to add the aliases below to ``bazaar.conf``:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[ALIASES] <br>
tip = log &minus;r&minus;1 <br>
top = log &minus;l10 &minus;&minus;line <br>
show = log &minus;v &minus;p</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">``bzr tip``
will then show the latest revision while ``bzr top`` <br>
will show the last 10 mainline revisions. To see the details
of a <br>
particular revision X, ``bzr show &minus;rX``.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
interested in looking deeper into a particular merge X, <br>
use ``bzr log &minus;n0 &minus;rX``.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">``bzr log
&minus;v`` on a branch with lots of history is currently
<br>
very slow. A fix for this issue is currently under
development. <br>
With or without that fix, it is recommended that a revision
range <br>
be given when using the &minus;v option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bzr has a
generic full&minus;text matching plugin, bzr&minus;search,
that can be <br>
used to find revisions matching user names, commit messages,
etc. <br>
Among other features, this plugin can find all revisions
containing <br>
a list of words but not others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When exploring
non&minus;mainline history on large projects with deep <br>
history, the performance of log can be greatly improved by
installing <br>
the historycache plugin. This plugin buffers historical
information <br>
trading disk space for faster speed.</p>

the default is the upstream branch or the branch most
recently merged using &minus;&minus;remember. The source of
the merge may also be specified in the form of a path to a
file in another branch: in this case, only the modifications
to that file are merged into the current working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When merging
from a branch, by default bzr will try to merge in all new
work from the other branch, automatically determining an

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
two values, &quot;&minus;&minus;revision BASE..OTHER&quot;,
only revisions BASE through OTHER, excluding BASE but
including OTHER, will be merged. If this causes some
revisions to be skipped, i.e. if the destination branch does
not already contain revision BASE, such a merge is commonly
referred to as a &quot;cherrypick&quot;. Unlike a normal
merge, Bazaar does not currently track cherrypicks. The
changes look like a normal commit, and the history of the
changes from the other branch is not stored in the
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Revision
numbers are always relative to the source branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Merge will do
its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
are some kinds of problems only a human can fix. When it
encounters those, it will mark a conflict. A conflict means
that you need to fix something, before you can commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use bzr resolve
when you have fixed a problem. See also bzr conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is no

&minus;&minus;no&minus;remember to avoid setting it). After
that, you can omit the branch to use the default. To change
the default, use &minus;&minus;remember. The value will only
be saved if the remote location can be accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The results of
the merge are placed into the destination working directory,
where they can be reviewed (with bzr diff), tested, and then
committed to record the result of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge refuses
to run if there are any uncommitted changes, unless
&minus;&minus;force is given. If &minus;&minus;force is
given, then the changes from the source will be merged with
the current working tree, including any uncommitted changes
in the tree. The &minus;&minus;force option can also be used
to create a merge revision which has more than two

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one would

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To remove only
some changes, without reverting to a prior version, use
merge instead. For example, &quot;merge . &minus;r
&minus;2..&minus;3&quot; (don&acute;t forget the
&quot;.&quot;) will remove the changes introduced by the
second last commit (&minus;2), without affecting the changes
introduced by the last commit (&minus;1). To remove certain
changes on a hunk&minus;by&minus;hunk basis, see the shelve

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, any
files that have been manually changed will be backed up
first. (Files changed only by merge are not backed up.)
Backup files have &acute;.~#~&acute; appended to their name,
where # is a number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
provide files, you can use their current pathname or the
pathname from the target revision. So you can use revert to
&quot;undelete&quot; a file by name. If you name a
directory, all the contents of that directory will be
reverted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
newly added files since the target revision, they will be
removed. If the files to be removed have been changed,
backups will be created as above. Directories containing
unknown files will not be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The working
tree contains a list of revisions that have been merged but
not yet committed. These revisions will be included as
additional parents of the next commit. Normally, using
revert clears that list as well as reverting the files. If
any files are specified, revert leaves the list of
uncommitted merges alone and reverts only the files. Use
``bzr revert and ``bzr revert
&minus;&minus;forget&minus;merges`` to clear the pending
merge list without reverting any files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;bzr
revert &minus;&minus;forget&minus;merges&quot;, it is
possible to apply all of the changes from a branch in a
single revision. To do this, perform the merge as desired.
Then doing revert with the
&quot;&minus;&minus;forget&minus;merges&quot; option will
keep the content of the tree as it was, but it will clear
the list of pending merges. The next commit will then
contain all of the changes that are present in the other
branch, but without any other parent revisions. Because this
technique forgets where these changes originated, it may
cause additional conflicts on later merges involving the
same source and target branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* A

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* An optional

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">`bzr send`
creates a compact data set that, when applied using bzr
merge, has the same effect as merging from the source
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default the
merge directive is self&minus;contained and can be applied
to any branch containing submit_branch in its ancestory
without needing access to the source branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&minus;&minus;no&minus;bundle is specified, then Bazaar
doesn&acute;t send the contents of the revisions, but only a
structured request to merge from the public_location. In
that case the public_branch is needed and it must be
up&minus;to&minus;date and accessible to the recipient. The
public_branch is always included if known, so that people
can check it later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The submit
branch defaults to the parent of the source branch, but can
be overridden. Both submit branch and public branch will be
remembered in branch.conf the first time they are used for a
particular branch. The source branch defaults to that
containing the working directory, but can be changed using
&minus;&minus;from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both the submit
branch and the public branch follow the usual behavior with
respect to &minus;&minus;remember: If there is no default
location set, the first send will set it (use
&minus;&minus;no&minus;remember to avoid setting it). After
that, you can omit the location to use the default. To
change the default, use &minus;&minus;remember. The value
will only be saved if the location can be accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
calculate those changes, bzr must analyse the submit branch.
Therefore it is most efficient for the submit branch to be a
local mirror. If a public location is known for the
submit_branch, that location is used in the merge
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behaviour is to send the merge directive by mail, unless
&minus;o is given, in which case it is sent to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mail is sent
using your preferred mail program. This should be
transparent on Windows (it uses MAPI). On Unix, it requires
the xdg&minus;email utility. If the preferred client
can&acute;t be found (or used), your editor will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use a
specific mail program, set the mail_client configuration
option. (For Thunderbird 1.5, this works around some bugs.)
Supported values for specific clients are &quot;claws&quot;,
&quot;evolution&quot;, &quot;kmail&quot;,
&quot;mail.app&quot; (MacOS X&acute;s Mail.app),
&quot;mutt&quot;, and &quot;thunderbird&quot;; generic
options are &quot;default&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;,
&quot;emacsclient&quot;, &quot;mapi&quot;, and
&quot;xdg&minus;email&quot;. Plugins may also add supported
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If mail is
being sent, a to address is required. This can be supplied
either on the commandline, by setting the submit_to
configuration option in the branch itself or the
child_submit_to configuration option in the submit
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two formats are
currently supported: &quot;4&quot; uses revision bundle
format 4 and merge directive format 2. It is significantly
faster and smaller than older formats. It is compatible with
Bazaar 0.19 and later. It is the default. &quot;0.9&quot;
uses revision bundle format 0.9 and merge directive format
1. It is compatible with Bazaar 0.12 &minus; 0.18.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The merge
directives created by bzr send may be applied using bzr
merge or bzr pull by specifying a file containing a merge
directive as the location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bzr send makes
extensive use of public locations to map local locations
into URLs that can be used by other people. See `bzr help

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upgrade a
repository, branch or working tree to a newer format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
default format has changed after a major new release of
Bazaar, you may be informed during certain operations that
you should upgrade. Upgrading to a newer format may improve
performance or make new features available. It may however
limit interoperability with older repositories or with older
versions of Bazaar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wish to
upgrade to a particular format rather than the current
default, that can be specified using the
&minus;&minus;format option. As a consequence, you can use
the upgrade command this way to &quot;downgrade&quot; to an
earlier format, though some conversions are a one way
process (e.g. changing from the 1.x default to the 2.x
default) so downgrading is not always possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
backup.bzr.~#~ directory is created at the start of the
conversion process (where # is a number). By default, this
is left there on completion. If the conversion fails, delete
the new .bzr directory and rename this one back in its
place. Use the &minus;&minus;clean option to ask for the
backup.bzr directory to be removed on successful conversion.
Alternatively, you can delete it by hand if everything looks
good afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the location
given is a shared repository, dependent branches are also
converted provided the repository converts successfully. If
the conversion of a branch fails, remaining branches are
still tried.</p>

views.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Views provide a
mask over the tree so that users can focus on a subset of a
tree when doing their work. After creating a view, commands
that support a list of files &minus; status, diff, commit,
etc &minus; effectively have that list of files implicitly
given each time. An explicit list of files can still be
given but those files must be within the current view.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
a view has a short life&minus;span: it is created to make a
selected change and is deleted once that change is
committed. At other times, you may wish to create one or
more named views and switch between them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable the
current view without deleting it, you can switch to the
pseudo view called ``off``. This can be useful when you need
to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g. merge)
but want to switch back to your view after that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
To define the current view:</p>
