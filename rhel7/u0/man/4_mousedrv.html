<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mouse</b> is
an Xorg input driver for mice. The driver supports most
available mouse types and interfaces, though the level of
support for types of mice depends on the OS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>mouse</b> driver functions as a pointer input device.
Multiple mice are supported by multiple instances of this
driver.</p>

<h2>SUPPORTED HARDWARE
<a name="SUPPORTED HARDWARE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">USB mouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">USB (Universal Serial Bus)
ports are present on most modern computers. Several devices
can be plugged into this bus, including mice and keyboards.
Support for USB mice is platform specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">PS/2 mouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The PS/2 mouse is an
intelligent device and may have more than three buttons and
a wheel or a roller. The PS/2 mouse is usually compatible
with the original PS/2 mouse from IBM immediately after
power up. The PS/2 mouse with additional features requires a
specialized initialization procedure to enable these
features. Without proper initialization, it behaves as
though it were an ordinary two or three button mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Serial mouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">There have been numerous serial
mouse models from a number of manufacturers. Despite the
wide range of variations, there have been relatively few
protocols (data format) with which the serial mouse talks to
the host computer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The modern
serial mouse conforms to the PnP COM device specification so
that the host computer can automatically detect the mouse
and load an appropriate driver. This driver supports this
specification and can detect popular PnP serial mouse models
on most platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bus mouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The bus mouse connects to a
dedicated interface card in an expansion slot. Some older
video cards, notably those from ATI, and integrated I/O
cards may also have a bus mouse connector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The interface
type of the mouse can be determined by looking at the
connector of the mouse. USB mice have a thin rectangular
connector. PS/2 mice are equipped with a small, round DIN
6-pin connector. Serial mouse have a D-Sub female 9- or
25-pin connector. Bus mice have either a D-Sub male 9-pin
connector or a round DIN 9-pin connector. Some mice come
with adapters with which the connector can be converted to
another. If you are to use such an adapter, remember that
the connector at the very end of the mouse/adapter pair is
what matters.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DETAILS
<a name="CONFIGURATION DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
the X server version in use, input device options may be set
in either a xorg.conf file, an xorg.conf.d snippet or in the
configuration files read by the Hardware Abstraction Layer
(HAL) daemon, hald(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The driver can
auto-detect the mouse type on some platforms. On some
platforms this is limited to plug and play serial mice, and
on some the auto-detection works for any mouse that the
OS&rsquo;s kernel driver supports. On others, it is always
necessary to specify the mouse protocol in the config file.
The <i>README</i> document provided with this driver
contains some detailed information about this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
driver <b>Options</b> are supported: <b><br>
Option &quot;Protocol&quot;
&quot;</b><i>string</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the mouse protocol.
Valid protocol types include:</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Auto,
Microsoft, MouseSystems, MMSeries, Logitech, MouseMan,
MMHitTab, GlidePoint, IntelliMouse, ThinkingMouse,
ValuMouseScroll, AceCad, PS/2, ImPS/2, ExplorerPS/2,
ThinkingMousePS/2, MouseManPlusPS/2, GlidePointPS/2,
NetMousePS/2, NetScrollPS/2, BusMouse, SysMouse, WSMouse,
USB, VUID, Xqueue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
protocols are supported on all platforms. The
&quot;Auto&quot; protocol specifies that protocol
auto-detection should be attempted. The default protocol
setting is platform-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;Device&quot;
&quot;</b><i>string</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the device through
which the mouse can be accessed. A common setting is
&quot;/dev/mouse&quot;, which is often a symbolic link to
the real device. This option is mandatory, and there is no
default setting. The driver may however attempt to probe
some default devices if this option is missing. Property:
&quot;Device Node&quot; (read-only).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;Buttons&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the number of mouse
buttons. In cases where the number of buttons cannot be
auto-detected, the default value is 3. The maximum number is
24.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable the emulation of
the third (middle) mouse button for mice which only have two
physical buttons. The third button is emulated by pressing
both buttons simultaneously. Default: on, until a press of a
physical button 3 is detected. Property: &quot;Mouse Middle
Button Emulation&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;Emulate3Timeout&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the timeout (in
milliseconds) that the driver waits before deciding if two
buttons where pressed &quot;simultaneously&quot; when 3
button emulation is enabled. Default: 50. Property:
&quot;Mouse Middle Button Timeout&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;ChordMiddle&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable handling of mice
that send left+right events when the middle button is used.
Default: off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;EmulateWheel&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable
&quot;wheel&quot; emulation. Wheel emulation means emulating
button press/release events when the mouse is moved while a
specific real button is pressed. Wheel button events
(typically buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for scrolling.
Wheel emulation is useful for getting wheel-like behaviour
with trackballs. It can also be useful for mice with 4 or
more buttons but no wheel. See the description of the
<b>EmulateWheelButton</b>, <b>EmulateWheelInertia</b>,
<b>XAxisMapping</b>, and <b>YAxisMapping</b> options below.
Default: off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;EmulateWheelButton&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which button must be
held down to enable wheel emulation mode. While this button
is down, X and/or Y pointer movement will generate button
press/release events as specified for the
<b>XAxisMapping</b> and <b>YAxisMapping</b> settings. If set
to 0, no button is required and any motion of the device is
converted into wheel events. Default: 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;EmulateWheelInertia&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies how far (in pixels)
the pointer must move to generate button press/release
events in wheel emulation mode. Default: 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;EmulateWheelTimeout&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the time in
milliseconds the <b>EmulateWheelButton</b> must be pressed
before wheel emulation is started. If the
<b>EmulateWheelButton</b> is released before this timeout,
the original button press/release event is sent. Default:
200.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;XAxisMapping&quot; &quot;</b><i>N1
N2</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which buttons are
mapped to motion in the X direction in wheel emulation mode.
Button number <i>N1</i> is mapped to the negative X axis
motion and button number <i>N2</i> is mapped to the positive
X axis motion. Default: no mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;YAxisMapping&quot; &quot;</b><i>N1
N2</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which buttons are
mapped to motion in the Y direction in wheel emulation mode.
Button number <i>N1</i> is mapped to the negative Y axis
motion and button number <i>N2</i> is mapped to the positive
Y axis motion. Default: no mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;ZAxisMapping&quot; &quot;X&quot; <br>
Option &quot;ZAxisMapping&quot; &quot;Y&quot; <br>
Option &quot;ZAxisMapping&quot; &quot;</b><i>N1
N2</i><b>&quot; <br>
Option &quot;ZAxisMapping&quot; &quot;</b><i>N1 N2 N3
N4</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the mapping for the Z axis
(wheel) motion to buttons or another axis (<b>X</b> or
<b>Y</b>). Button number <i>N1</i> is mapped to the negative
Z axis motion and button number <i>N2</i> is mapped to the
positive Z axis motion. For mice with two wheels, four
button numbers can be specified, with the negative and
positive motion of the second wheel mapped respectively to
buttons number <i>N3</i> and <i>N4</i>. Note that the
protocols for mice with one and two wheels can be different
and the driver may not be able to autodetect it. Default:
&quot;4 5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;ButtonMapping&quot; &quot;</b><i>N1 N2
[...]</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies how physical mouse
buttons are mapped to logical buttons. Physical button 1 is
mapped to logical button <i>N1</i>, physical button 2 to
<i>N2</i>, and so forth. This enables the use of physical
buttons that are obscured by <i>ZAxisMapping</i>.
Default:&nbsp;&quot;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;8&nbsp;9&nbsp;10&nbsp;...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;FlipXY&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable swapping the X
and Y axes. This transformation is applied after the
<b>InvX</b>, <b>InvY</b> and <b>AngleOffset</b>
transformations. Default: off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;InvX&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Invert the X axis. Default:
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;InvY&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Invert the Y axis. Default:
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;AngleOffset&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a clockwise angular
offset (in degrees) to apply to the pointer motion. This
transformation is applied before the <b>FlipXY</b>,
<b>InvX</b> and <b>InvY</b> transformations. Default: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;SampleRate&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the number of
motion/button events the mouse sends per second. Setting
this is only supported for some mice, including some
Logitech mice and some PS/2 mice on some platforms. Default:
whatever the mouse is already set to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;Resolution&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the resolution of the
device in counts per inch. Setting this is only supported
for some mice, including some PS/2 mice on some platforms.
Default: whatever the mouse is already set to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;Sensitivity&quot;
&quot;</b><i>float</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mouse movements are multiplied
by this float before being processed. Use this mechanism to
slow down high resolution mice. Because values bigger than
1.0 will result in not all pixels on the screen being
accessible, you should better use mouse acceleration (see
<b>man xset</b>) for speeding up low resolution mice.
Default: 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;DragLockButtons&quot; &quot;</b><i>L1 B2 L3
B4</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets &quot;drag lock
buttons&quot; that simulate holding a button down, so that
low dexterity people do not have to hold a button down at
the same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur
in pairs, with the lock button number occurring first,
followed by the button number that is the target of the lock
button.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option
&quot;DragLockButtons&quot;
&quot;</b><i>M1</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets a &quot;master drag lock
button&quot; that acts as a &quot;Meta Key&quot; indicating
that the next button pressed is to be &quot;drag
locked&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;ClearDTR&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable clearing the DTR
line on the serial port used by the mouse. Some
dual-protocol mice require the DTR line to be cleared to
operate in the non-default protocol. This option is for
serial mice only and is handled by the X server. Default:
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;ClearRTS&quot;
&quot;</b><i>boolean</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable clearing the RTS
line on the serial port used by the mouse. Some
dual-protocol mice require the RTS line to be cleared to
operate in the non-default protocol. This option is for
serial mice only and is handled by the X server. Default:
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option &quot;BaudRate&quot;
&quot;</b><i>integer</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the baud rate to use for
communicating with a serial mouse. This option should rarely
be required because the default is correct for almost all
situations. Valid values include: 300, 1200, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200. Default: 1200.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
other options that may be used to control various parameters
for serial port communication, but they are not documented
here because the driver sets them correctly for each mouse
protocol type.</p>
