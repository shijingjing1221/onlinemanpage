<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip::Holidays
&minus; describes holidays and events</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This describes
the Holidays and Events sections of the config file, and how
they are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Holidays and
events are specific days that are named. Holidays are used
in business mode calculations, events are not. Events may be
used for other calendaring operations.</p>

<h2>HOLIDAYS
<a name="HOLIDAYS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The holiday
section of the config file is used to define holidays. Each
line is of the form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   STRING = HOLIDAY</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>HOLIDAY</small>
is the name of the holiday (or it can be blank in which case
the day will still be treated as a holiday... for example
the day after Thanksgiving is often a work holiday though it
is not named).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>STRING</small>
is a string which can be parsed to give a valid date. It can
be any of the following forms: <b><br>
A full date</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specific holidays can be set
which occur only a single time.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   May 5, 2000                     = A one&minus;time&minus;only holiday</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any format
parseable by Date::Manip::Date::parse_date can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>A date without a
year</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some holidays occur every year
on the same day. These can be defined using the simple
lines:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Jan 1                           = New Year's Day
   Jul 4th                         = Independence Day
   fourth Thu in Nov               = Thanksgiving</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These dates
must be written in a form which can be parsed as a full date
by simply adding the year to the end of the string. Please
refer to the Date::Manip::Date documentation to see what
forms will work. <small>ISO 8601</small> dates will not work
since the year comes first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any format
parseable by Date::Manip::Date::parse_date can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Recurrence</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The dates can be specified
using recurrences:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*0:0:0:0:0:0*EASTER            = Easter
   1*11:0:11:0:0:0*DWD             = Veteran's Day</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In cases where
you are interested in business type calculations,
you&rsquo;ll want to define most holidays using recurrences,
since they can define when a holiday is celebrated in the
financial world. For example, Christmas might be defined
as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Dec 25               = Christmas</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but if it falls
on a weekend, there won&rsquo;t be a business holiday
associated with it. It could be defined using a
recurrence:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*12:0:24:0:0:0*DWD  = Christmas</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">so that if
Christmas falls on a weekend, a holiday will be taken on the
Friday before or the Monday after the weekend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can use the
fully specified format of a recurrence:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  1*2:0:1:0:0:0***Jan 1 1999*Dec 31 2002 = Feb 2 from 1999&minus;2002</pre>


<h2>OTHER HOLIDAY CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="OTHER HOLIDAY CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Recurrences
which change years</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It is now valid to have a
recurrence defined for New Year&rsquo;s day which pushes the
holiday to the previous year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the most useful definition of New Year&rsquo;s day is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*1:0:1:0:0:0*DWD               = New Year's Day</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which means to
choose the closest working day to observe the holiday, even
though this might mean that the holiday is observed on the
previous year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Order of definitions is
preserved</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The order of the definitions is
preserved. In other words, when looking at the holidays for
a year, previously defined holidays (in the order given in
the config file) are correctly handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
if you wanted to define both Christmas and Boxing days
(Boxing is the day after Christmas, and is celebrated in
some parts of the world), and you wanted to celebrate
Christmas on a business day on or after Dec 25, and Boxing
day as the following work day, you could do it in one of the
following ways:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Christmas
   1*12:0:26:0:0:0*NWD  = Boxing</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Christmas
   1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Boxing</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Holidays go
into affect the minute they are parsed which is why the
second example works (though for clarity, the first one is
preferable). The first recurrence defined the first business
day on or after Dec 25 as Christmas. The second one then
defines the business day after that as Boxing day. Since the
definitions are stored as a list ( <small>NOT</small> a hash
as they were in Date::Manip 5.xx), using the same recurrence
twice does not cause a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Multiple holidays</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Having multiple holidays on a
single day is allowed. As an example, you may want to look
at New Years day as both the observed and actual holidays,
so you might have:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*1:0:1:0:0:0*DWD               = New Year's Day (observed)
   Jan 1                           = New Year's Day</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
time, both will fall on the same day, but sometimes they may
differ. In this example, it is important that the observed
holiday be listed first. Otherwise, Jan 1 will be marked as
a holiday and then the observed date will check Jan 1, but
where it is not a business day, it will move to another day
(due to the <small>DWD</small> modifier).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Likewise, the
two holidays:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   3rd Sunday in June              = Father's Day
   Jun 17                          = Bunker Hill Day</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sometimes fall
on the same day. Using the Date::Manip::Date::list_holidays
method (or the Date_IsHoliday function), you can get a list
of all names that the date contains.</p>

<h2>EVENTS
<a name="EVENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Events
section of the config file is similar to the Holiday
section. It is used to name certain days or times, but there
are a few important differences: <b><br>
Events can be assigned to any time and duration</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All holidays are exactly 1 day
long. They are assigned to a period of time from midnight to
midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Events can be
based at any time of the day, and may be of any
duration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Events don&rsquo;t affect
business mode calculations</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unlike holidays, events are
completely ignored when doing business mode
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas
holidays were added with business mode math in mind, events
were added with calendar and scheduling applications in
mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every line in
the events section is of the form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   EVENT = NAME</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<small>NAME</small> is the name of the event, and
<small>EVENT</small> defines when it occurs and its
duration. An <small>EVENT</small> can be defined in the
following ways:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   Date
   YMD
   YM
   Recur
   Date  ; Date
   YMD   ; YMD
   YM    ; YM
   Date  ; Delta
   Recur ; Delta</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date refers to
a full date/time (and is any string that can be parsed by
Date::Manip::Date::parse). <small>YMD</small> is any string
which can be parsed by Date::Manip::Date::parse_date.
<small>YM</small> is any string which can be parsed by the
parse_date method to give a date in the current year. Recur
is a partial or fully specified recurrence. Delta is any
string that can be parsed to form a delta.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
&quot;Date&quot; form, or the &quot;Recur&quot; form, the
event starts at the time (or times) specified by the date or
recurrence, and last 1 hour long. With the &quot;
<small>YMD&quot;</small> and &quot; <small>YM&quot;</small>
forms, the event occurs on the given day, and lasts all
day.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With all of the
two part forms (&quot;Date;Date&quot;, &quot;
<small>YM</small> ;YM&quot;, etc.), the event starts at the
first date and goes to the second date, or goes an amount of
time specified by the delta.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;
<small>YMD</small> ;YMD&quot; and &quot; <small>YM</small>
;YM&quot; forms means that the event lasts from the start of
the first date to the end of the second. In the Date;Date
form, the event goes from the first date to the second date
inclusive. In other words, both dates are in the event. In
the &quot;Date;Delta&quot; and &quot;Recur;Delta&quot;
forms, the Delta tells the length of the event. Also, in the
Date;Date form, the second date may <small>NOT</small> be
expressed as a delta.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
having an event longer than 1 year is <small>NOT</small>
supported, but no checking is done for this.</p>
