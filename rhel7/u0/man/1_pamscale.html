<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>
scales a Netpbm image by a specified factor, or scales
individually horizontally and vertically by specified
factors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can either
enlarge (scale factor &gt; 1) or reduce (scale factor &lt;
1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>
work on multi-image streams, scaling each one independently.
But before Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), it scales only the
first image and ignores the rest of the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Scale
Factors</b> <br>
The options <b>-width</b>, <b>-height</b>, <b>-xsize</b>,
<b>-ysize</b>, <b>-xscale</b>, <b>-yscale</b>,
<b>-xyfit</b>, <b>-xyfill</b>, <b>-reduce</b>, and
<b>-pixels</b> control the amount of scaling. For backward
compatibility, there is also <b>-xysize</b> and the
<i>scale_factor</i> argument, but you shouldn&rsquo;t use
those.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-width</b>
and <b>-height</b> specify the width and height in pixels
you want the resulting image to be. See below for rules when
you specify one and not the other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-xsize</b>
and <b>-ysize</b> are synonyms for <b>-width</b> and
<b>-height</b>, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-xscale</b>
and <b>-yscale</b> tell the factor by which you want the
width and height of the image to change from source to
result (e.g. <b>-xscale 2</b> means you want to double the
width; <b>-xscale .5</b> means you want to halve it). See
below for rules when you specify one and not the other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
specify an absolute size or scale factor for both
dimensions, <b>pamscale</b> scales each dimension
independently without consideration of the aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
one dimension as a pixel size and don&rsquo;t specify the
other dimension, <b>pamscale</b> scales the unspecified
dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
one dimension as a scale factor and don&rsquo;t specify the
other dimension, <b>pamscale</b> leaves the unspecified
dimension unchanged from the input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
the <i>scale_factor</i> parameter instead of dimension
options, that is the scale factor for both dimensions. It is
equivalent to <b>-xscale=</b><i>scale_factor</i>
<b>-yscale=</b><i>scale_factor</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying the
<b>-reduce</b> <i>reduction_factor</i> option is equivalent
to specifying the <i>scale_factor</i> parameter, where
<i>scale_factor</i> is the reciprocal of
<i>reduction_factor</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-xyfit</b>
specifies a bounding box. <b>pamscale</b> scales the input
image to the largest size that fits within the box, while
preserving its aspect ratio. <b>-xysize</b> is a synonym for
this. Before Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004), <b>-xyfit</b> did
not exist, but <b>-xysize</b> did.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-xyfill</b>
is similar, but <b>pamscale</b> scales the input image to
the smallest size that completely fills the box, while
preserving its aspect ratio. This option has existed since
Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-pixels</b>
specifies a maximum total number of output pixels.
<b>pamscale</b> scales the image down to that number of
pixels. If the input image is already no more than that many
pixels, <b>pamscale</b> just copies it as output;
<b>pamscale</b> does not scale up with <b>-pixels</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you enlarge
by a factor of 3 or more, you should probably add a
<i>pnmsmooth</i> step; otherwise, you can see the original
pixels in the resulting image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Usage
Notes</b> <br>
A useful application of <b>pamscale</b> is to blur an image.
Scale it down (without <b>-nomix</b>) to discard some
information, then scale it back up using
<b>pamstretch</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or scale it
back up with <b>pamscale</b> and create a
&rsquo;pixelized&rsquo; image, which is sort of a
computer-age version of blurring.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Transparency
<br>
pamscale</b> understands transparency and properly mixes
pixels considering the pixels&rsquo; transparency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Proper mixing
<i>does not</i> mean just mixing the transparency value and
the color component values separately. In a PAM image, a
pixel which is not opaque represents a color that contains
light of the foreground color indicated explicitly in the
PAM and light of a background color to be named later. But
the numerical scale of a color component sample in a PAM is
as if the pixel is opaque. So a pixel that is supposed to
contain half-strength red light for the foreground plus some
light from the background has a red color sample that says
<i>full</i> red and a transparency sample that says 50%
opaque. In order to mix pixels, you have to first convert
the color sample values to numbers that represent amount of
light directly (i.e. multiply by the opaqueness) and after
mixing, convert back (divide by the opaqueness).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Input And
Output Image Types <br>
pamscale</b> produces output of the same type (and tuple
type if the type is PAM) as the input, except if the input
is PBM. In that case, the output is PGM with maxval 255. The
purpose of this is to allow meaningful pixel mixing. Note
that there is no equivalent exception when the input is PAM.
If the PAM input tuple type is BLACKANDWHITE, the PAM output
tuple type is also BLACKANDWHITE, and you get no meaningful
pixel mixing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want PBM
output with PBM input, use <b>pamditherbw</b> to convert
<b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s output to PBM. Also consider
<b>pbmreduce</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s
function is essentially undefined for PAM input images that
are not of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE, BLACKANDWHITE, or the
_ALPHA variations of those. (By standard Netpbm backward
compatibility, this includes PBM, PGM, and PPM images).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might think
it would have an obvious effect on other tuple types, but
remember that the aforementioned tuple types have
gamma-adjusted sample values, and <b>pamscale</b> uses that
fact in its calculations. And it treats a transparency plane
different from any other plane.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>
does not simply reject unrecognized tuple types because
there&rsquo;s a possibility that just by coincidence you can
get useful function out of it with some other tuple type and
the right combination of options (consider <b>-linear</b> in
particular).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Methods Of
Scaling</b> <br>
There are numerous ways to scale an image. <b>pamscale</b>
implements a bunch of them; you select among them with
invocation options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pixel
Mixing</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pamscale&rsquo;s
default method is pixel mixing. To understand this, imagine
the source image as composed of square tiles. Each tile is a
pixel and has uniform color. The tiles are all the same
size. Now take a transparent sheet the size of the target
image, marked with a square grid of tiles the same size.
Stretch or compress the source image to the size of the
sheet and lay the sheet over the source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each cell in
the overlay grid stands for a pixel of the target image. For
example, if you are scaling a 100x200 image up by 1.5, the
source image is 100 x 200 tiles, and the transparent sheet
is marked off in 150 x 300 cells.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each cell
covers parts of multiple tiles. To make the target image,
just color in each cell with the color which is the average
of the colors the cell covers -- weighted by the amount of
that color it covers. A cell in our example might cover 4/9
of a blue tile, 2/9 of a red tile, 2/9 of a green tile, and
1/9 of a white tile. So the target pixel would be somewhat
unsaturated blue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you are
scaling up or down by an integer, the results are simple.
When scaling up, pixels get duplicated. When scaling down,
pixels get thrown away. In either case, the colors in the
target image are a subset of those in the source image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the scale
factor is weirder than that, the target image can have
colors that didn&rsquo;t exist in the original. For example,
a red pixel next to a white pixel in the source might become
a red pixel, a pink pixel, and a white pixel in the
target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This method
tends to replicate what the human eye does as it moves
closer to or further away from an image. It also tends to
replicate what the human eye sees, when far enough away to
make the pixelization disappear, if an image is not made of
pixels and simply stretches or shrinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Discrete
Sampling</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Discrete
sampling is basically the same thing as pixel mixing except
that, in the model described above, instead of averaging the
colors of the tiles the cell covers, you pick the one color
that covers the most area.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result you
see is that when you enlarge an image, pixels get duplicated
and when you reduce an image, some pixels get discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The advantage
of this is that you end up with an image made from the same
color palette as the original. Sometimes that&rsquo;s
important.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
disadvantage is that it distorts the picture. If you scale
up by 1.5 horizontally, for example, the even numbered input
pixels are doubled in the output and the odd numbered ones
are copied singly. If you have a bunch of one pixel wide
lines in the source, you may find that some of them stretch
to 2 pixels, others remain 1 pixel when you enlarge. When
you reduce, you may find that some of the lines disappear
completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You select
discrete sampling with <b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s <b>-nomix</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Actually,
<b>-nomix</b> doesn&rsquo;t do exactly what I described
above. It does the scaling in two passes - first horizontal,
then vertical. This can produce slightly different
results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
common case in which one often finds it burdensome to have
<b>pamscale</b> make up colors that weren&rsquo;t there
originally: Where one is working with an image format such
as GIF that has a limited number of possible colors per
image. If you take a GIF with 256 colors, convert it to PPM,
scale by .625, and convert back to GIF, you will probably
find that the reduced image has way more than 256 colors,
and therefore cannot be converted to GIF. One way to solve
this problem is to do the reduction with discrete sampling
instead of pixel mixing. Probably a better way is to do the
pixel mixing, but then color quantize the result with
<b>pnmquant</b> before converting to GIF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the scale
factor is an integer (which means you&rsquo;re scaling up),
discrete sampling and pixel mixing are identical -- output
pixels are always just N copies of the input pixels. In this
case, though, consider using <b>pamstretch</b> instead of
<b>pamscale</b> to get the added pixels interpolated instead
of just copied and thereby get a smoother enlargement.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s
discrete sampling is faster than pixel mixing, but
<b>pamenlarge</b> is faster still. <b>pamenlarge</b> works
only on integer enlargements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">discrete
sampling (<b>-nomix</b>) was new in Netpbm 9.24 (January
2002).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Resampling</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Resampling
assumes that the source image is a discrete sampling of some
original continuous image. That is, it assumes there is some
non-pixelized original image and each pixel of the source
image is simply the color of that image at a particular
point. Those points, naturally, are the intersections of a
square grid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The idea of
resampling is just to compute that original image, then
sample it at a different frequency (a grid of a different
scale).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problem, of
course, is that sampling necessarily throws away the
information you need to rebuild the original image. So we
have to make a bunch of assumptions about the makeup of the
original image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You tell
<b>pamscale</b> to use the resampling method by specifying
the <b>-filter</b> option. The value of this option is the
name of a function, from the set listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>To explain
resampling, we are going to talk about a simple one
dimensional scaling</b> -- scaling a single row of grayscale
pixels horizontally. If you can understand that, you can
easily understand how to do a whole image: Scale each of the
rows of the image, then scale each of the resulting columns.
And scale each of the color component planes separately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a first step
in resampling, <b>pamscale</b> converts the source image,
which is a set of discrete pixel values, into a continuous
step function. A step function is a function whose graph is
a staircase-y thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, we
convolve the step function with a proper scaling of the
filter function that you identified with <b>-filter</b>. If
you don&rsquo;t know what the mathematical concept of
convolution (convolving) is, you are officially lost. You
cannot understand this explanation. The result of this
convolution is the imaginary original continuous image
we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, we
make target pixels by picking values from that function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To understand
what is going on, we use Fourier analysis:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The idea is
that the only difference between our step function and the
original continuous function (remember that we constructed
the step function from the source image, which is itself a
sampling of the original continuous function) is that the
step function has a bunch of high frequency Fourier
components added. If we could chop out all the higher
frequency components of the step function, and know that
they&rsquo;re all higher than any frequency in the original
function, we&rsquo;d have the original function back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resampling
method <i>assumes</i> that the original function was sampled
at a high enough frequency to form a perfect sampling. A
perfect sampling is one from which you can recover exactly
the original continuous function. The Nyquist theorem says
that as long as your sample rate is at least twice the
highest frequency in your original function, the sampling is
perfect. So we <i>assume</i> that the image is a sampling of
something whose highest frequency is half the sample rate
(pixel resolution) or less. Given that, our filtering does
in fact recover the original continuous image from the
samples (pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To chop out all
the components above a certain frequency, we just multiply
the Fourier transform of the step function by a rectangle
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We could find
the Fourier transform of the step function, multiply it by a
rectangle function, and then Fourier transform the result
back, but there&rsquo;s an easier way. Mathematicians tell
us that multiplying in the frequency domain is equivalent to
convolving in the time domain. That means multiplying the
Fourier transform of F by a rectangle function R is the same
as convolving F with the Fourier transform of R. It&rsquo;s
a lot better to take the Fourier transform of R, and build
it into <b>pamscale</b> than to have <b>pamscale</b> take
the Fourier transform of the input image dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That leaves
only one question: What <i>is</i> the Fourier transform of a
rectangle function? Answer: sinc. Recall from math that sinc
is defined as sinc(x) = sin(PI*x)/PI*x.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hence, when you
specify <b>-filter=sinc</b>, you are effectively passing the
step function of the source image through a low pass
frequency filter and recovering a good approximation of the
original continuous image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Refiltering</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s
another twist: If you simply sample the reconstructed
original continuous image at the new sample rate, and that
new sample rate isn&rsquo;t at least twice the highest
frequency in the original continuous image, you won&rsquo;t
get a perfect sampling. In fact, you&rsquo;ll get something
with ugly aliasing in it. Note that this can&rsquo;t be a
problem when you&rsquo;re scaling up (increasing the sample
rate), because the fact that the old sample rate was above
the Nyquist level means so is the new one. But when scaling
down, it&rsquo;s a problem. Obviously, you have to give up
image quality when scaling down, but aliasing is not the
best way to do it. It&rsquo;s better just to remove high
frequency components from the original continuous image
before sampling, and then get a perfect sampling of
that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore,
<b>pamscale</b> filters out frequencies above half the new
sample rate before picking the new samples.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Approximations</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
<b>pamscale</b> doesn&rsquo;t do the convolution precisely.
Instead of evaluating the filter function at every point, it
samples it -- assumes that it doesn&rsquo;t change any more
often than the step function does. <b>pamscale</b> could
actually do the true integration fairly easily. Since the
filter functions are built into the program, the integrals
of them could be too. Maybe someday it will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
more complication with the Fourier analysis. sinc has
nonzero values on out to infinity and minus infinity. That
makes it hard to compute a convolution with it. So instead,
there are filter functions that approximate sinc but are
nonzero only within a manageable range. To get those, you
multiply the sinc function by a <i>window function</i>,
which you select with the <b>-window</b> option. The same
holds for other filter functions that go on forever like
sinc. By default, for a filter that needs a window function,
the window function is the Blackman function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filter
Functions Besides Sinc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The math
described above works only with sinc as the filter function.
<b>pamscale</b> offers many other filter functions, though.
Some of these approximate sinc and are faster to compute.
For most of them, I have no idea of the mathematical
explanation for them, but people do find they give pleasing
results. They may not be based on resampling at all, but
just exploit the convolution that is coincidentally part of
a resampling calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For some filter
functions, you can tell just by looking at the convolution
how they vary the resampling process from the perfect one
based on sinc:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The impulse
filter assumes that the original continuous image is in fact
a step function -- the very one we computed as the first
step in the resampling. This is mathematically equivalent to
the discrete sampling method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The box
(rectangle) filter assumes the original image is a piecewise
linear function. Its graph just looks like straight lines
connecting the pixel values. This is mathematically
equivalent to the pixel mixing method (but mixing
brightness, not light intensity, so like <b>pamscale
-linear</b>) when scaling down, and interpolation (ala
<b>pamstretch</b>) when scaling up.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Gamma</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>
assumes the underlying continuous function is a function of
brightness (as opposed to light intensity), and therefore
does all this math using the gamma-adjusted numbers found in
a PNM or PAM image. The <b>-linear</b> option is not
available with resampling (it causes <b>pamscale</b> to
fail), because it wouldn&rsquo;t be useful enough to justify
the implementation effort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Resampling
(<b>-filter</b>) was new in Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The filter
functions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a list
of the function names you can specify for the <b>-filter</b>
option. For most of them, you&rsquo;re on your own to figure
out just what the function is and what kind of scaling it
does. These are common functions from mathematics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linear vs
Gamma-adjusted</b> <br>
The pixel mixing scaling method described above involves
intensities of pixels (more precisely, it involves
individual intensities of primary color components of
pixels). But the PNM and PNM-equivalent PAM image formats
represent intensities with gamma-adjusted numbers that are
not linearly proportional to intensity. So <b>pamscale</b>,
by default, performs a calculation on each sample read from
its input and each sample written to its output to convert
between these gamma-adjusted numbers and internal
intensity-proportional numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you
are not working with true PNM or PAM images, but rather a
variation in which the sample values are in fact directly
proportional to intensity. If so, use the <b>-linear</b>
option to tell <b>pamscale</b> this. <b>pamscale</b> then
will skip the conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The conversion
takes time. In one experiment, it increased by a factor of
10 the time required to reduce an image. And the difference
between intensity-proportional values and gamma-adjusted
values may be small enough that you would barely see a
difference in the result if you just pretended that the
gamma-adjusted values were in fact intensity-proportional.
So just to save time, at the expense of some image quality,
you can specify <b>-linear</b> even when you have true PPM
input and expect true PPM output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the first
13 years of Netpbm&rsquo;s life, until Netpbm 10.20 (January
2004), <b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s predecessor <b>pnmscale</b>
always treated the PPM samples as intensity-proportional
even though they were not, and drew few complaints. So using
<b>-linear</b> as a lie is a reasonable thing to do if speed
is important to you. But if speed is important, you also
should consider the <b>-nomix</b> option and
<b>pnmscalefixed</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
technique to consider is to convert your PNM image to the
linear variation with <b>pnmgamma</b>, run <b>pamscale</b>
on it and other transformations that like linear PNM, and
then convert it back to true PNM with <b>pnmgamma
-ungamma</b>. <b>pnmgamma</b> is often faster than
<b>pamscale</b> in doing the conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>-nomix</b>, <b>-linear</b> has no effect. That&rsquo;s
because <b>pamscale</b> does not concern itself with the
meaning of the sample values in this method; <b>pamscale</b>
just copies numbers from its input to its output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Precision
<br>
pamscale</b> uses floating point arithmetic internally.
There is a speed cost associated with this. For some images,
you can get the acceptable results (in fact, sometimes
identical results) faster with <b>pnmscalefixed</b>, which
uses fixed point arithmetic. <b>pnmscalefixed</b> may,
however, distort your image a little. See the
<b>pnmscalefixed</b> user manual for a complete discussion
of the difference.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamscale</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004). It was adapted from,
and obsoleted, <b>pnmscale</b>. <b>pamscale</b>&rsquo;s
primary difference from <b>pnmscale</b> is that it handles
the PAM format and uses the &quot;pam&quot; facilities of
the Netpbm programming library. But it also added the
resampling class of scaling method. Furthermore, it properly
does its pixel mixing arithmetic (by default) using
intensity-proportional values instead of the gamma-adjusted
values the <b>pnmscale</b> uses. To get the old
<b>pnmscale</b> arithmetic, you can specify the
<b>-linear</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The intensity
proportional stuff came out of suggestions by <i>Adam M
Costello</i> in January 2004.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resampling
algorithms are mostly taken from code contributed by
<i>Michael Reinelt</i> in December 2003.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The version of
<b>pnmscale</b> from which <b>pamscale</b> was derived,
itself evolved out of the original Pbmplus version of
<b>pnmscale</b> by Jef Poskanzer (1989, 1991). But none of
that original code remains.</p>
