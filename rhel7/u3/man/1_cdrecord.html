<h2>NOTE
<a name="NOTE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There may be
similarities and differences between this program and other
disk recording application(s). See the <b>CREDITS</b> and
<b>AUTHORS</b> sections below to learn about the origin of
<b>wodim.</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wodim</b> is
used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an Orange Book
CD-Recorder or to write DVD media on a DVD-Recorder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>device</i> is the device file or label offered by the
operating system to access the recorder with SCSI GENERIC
(sg) interface. Note that some operating systems may provide
separate device nodes for block&minus;oriented and sg
access. For example, on older <i>Linux</i> systems, the sg
access was available through <i>/dev/sg...</i> files while
the block oriented access was done through associated (but
not identical) <i>/dev/hd...</i> and <i>/dev/sr...</i> (or
<i>/dev/scd...</i> ) files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In any case,
the user running <b>wodim</b> needs read and write access to
the particular device file on a Linux system. It is
recommended to be root or install the application as
suid-root, because certain versions of Linux (kernel) limit
the set of SCSI commands allowed for non-root users. Even if
usage without root identity is possible in many cases, some
device drivers still may fail, show unexplainable problems
and generally the problems become harder to debug. The risk
for buffer-underruns is also increased. See the <i>PROCESS
SCHEDULING PRIORITY</i> section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is an
alternative way of specifying the device, using the
traditional SCSI descriptions in form of
<i>devicetype:bus/target/lun</i> specification. However, the
success of this method is not guaranteed since it requires
an adaptation scheme for your architecture, and the numbers
may vary depending on the hardware-internal numbering or on
the order of hot-plug device detection. If your operating
system does not provide a sufficient framework for keeping
this numbers persistent, don&rsquo;t rely on them. See
<b>&minus;scanbus</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;devices</b>
options below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
emulated SCSI compatible device systems, using the SCSI
protocols transported over various hardware/media types. The
most known examples is ATAPI (&quot;IDE burners&quot;) or
USB storage (&quot;external USB case&quot;). If the
pseudo-SCSI b/t/l device address specification is used
instead of the native one, you need to prepend the
&quot;devicetype:&quot; description to the emulated
&quot;bus/target/lun&quot; device address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a file
/etc/wodim.conf exists, the parameter to the <b>dev=</b>
option may also be a drive name label in that file (see
FILES section).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
exception, the device specification can be <i>-1</i> or just
omitted, which invokes automatic guessing of an appropriate
device for the selected operation. However, this guessing is
not available everywhere and is not reliable; it is only
available for the user&rsquo;s convenience in simple
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In <i>Track At
Once</i> mode, each <i>track</i> corresponds to a single
file that contains the prepared data for that track. If the
argument is &lsquo;<b>&minus;</b>&rsquo;, standard input is
used for that track. Only one track may be taken from
<i>stdin</i>. In the other write modes, the direct file to
track relation may not be implemented. In
<b>&minus;clone</b> mode, a single file contains all data
for the whole disk. To allow DVD writing on platforms that
do not implement large file support, <b>wodim</b>
concatenates all file arguments to a single track when
writing to DVD media.</p>

<h2>PROCESS SCHEDULING PRIORITY
<a name="PROCESS SCHEDULING PRIORITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wodim tries to
get higher process priority using different methods. This is
important because the burn process is usually a realtime
task, no long delays should occur while transmitting fresh
data to the recorder. This is especially important on
systems with insufficient RAM where swapping can create
delays of many seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A possible
workaround on underpowered systems is the use of the
burnfree or similar feature, allowing the recorder to
resume.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Root
permissions are usually required to get higher process
scheduling priority.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On <b>SVr4</b>
compliant systems, <b>wodim</b> uses the real time class to
get the highest scheduling priority that is possible (higher
than all kernel processes). On systems with <b>POSIX real
time scheduling</b> wodim uses real time scheduling too, but
may not be able to gain a priority that is higher than all
kernel processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to be
able to use the SCSI transport subsystem of the OS, run at
highest priority and lock itself into core <b>wodim</b>
either needs to be run as root, needs to be installed suid
root or must be called via <b>RBACs</b> pfexec
mechanism.</p>

writing process, that occur in the CD/DVD-Recorder. If you
get incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag
to get more detailed output. <b>&minus;VV</b> will show data
buffer content in addition. Using <b>&minus;V</b> or
<b>&minus;VV</b> slows down the process and may be the
reason for a buffer underrun.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;immed</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell wodim to set the <b>SCSI
IMMED</b> flag in certain commands
(load/eject/blank/close_track/close_session). This can be
useful on broken systems with ATAPI harddisk and CD/DVD
writer on the same bus or with SCSI systems that don&rsquo;t
use disconnect/reconnect. These systems will freeze while
blanking or fixating a CD/DVD or while a DVD writer is
filling up a session to the minimum amount (approx. 800 MB).
Setting the <b>&minus;immed</b> flag will request the
command to return immediately while the operation proceeds
in background, making the bus usable for the other devices
and avoiding the system freeze. This is an experimental
feature which may work or not, depending on the model of the
CD/DVD writer. A correct solution would be to set up a
correct cabling but there seem to be notebooks around that
have been set up the wrong way by the manufacturer. As it is
impossible to fix this problem in notebooks, the
<b>&minus;immed</b> option has been added.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A second
experimental feature of the <b>&minus;immed</b> flag is to
tell wodim to try to wait short times while writing to the
media. This is expected to free the IDE bus if the CD/DVD
writer and the data source are connected to the same IDE
cable. In this case, the CD/DVD writer would otherwise
usually block the IDE bus for nearly all the time making it
impossible to fetch data from the source drive. See also
<b>minbuf=</b> and <b>&minus;v</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use both
features at your own risk. If it turns out that it would
make sense to have a separate option for the wait feature,
write to the author and convince him.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>minbuf=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The # <b>minbuf=</b> option
allows to define the minimum drive buffer fill ratio for the
experimental ATAPI wait mode that is intended to free the
IDE bus to allow hard disk and CD/DVD writer to be on the
same IDE cable. As the wait mode currently only works when
the verbose option <b>&minus;v</b> has been specified,
<b>wodim</b> implies the verbose option in case the
<b>&minus;immed</b> or <b>minbuf=</b> option have been
specified. Valid values for <b>minbuf=</b> are between 25
and 95 for 25%...95% minimum drive buffer fill ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select Set <b>RAW writing
mode</b> with 2352 byte sectors plus 96 bytes of raw P-W
subchannel data resulting in a sector size of 2448 bytes.
This is the preferred raw writing mode as it gives best
control over the CD writing process. If you find any
problems with the layout of a disk or with sub channel
content (e.g. wrong times on the display when playing the
CD) and your drive supports to write in <b>&minus;raw96r</b>
or <b>&minus;raw16</b> mode, you should give it a try. There
are several CD writers with bad firmware that result in
broken disks when writing in TAO or SAO mode. Writing data
disks in raw mode needs significantly more CPU time than
other write modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result
in buffer underruns. Note that wodim needs to know the size
of each track in advance for this mode (see the

This is the less preferred raw writing mode as only a few
recorders support it and some of these recorders have bugs
in the firmware implementation. Don&rsquo;t use this mode if
your recorder supports <b>&minus;raw96r</b> or
<b>&minus;raw16</b>. Writing data disks in raw mode needs

<p>Allow multi session CDs to be made. This flag needs to
be present on all sessions of a multi session disk, except
you want to create a session that will be the last session
on the media. The fixation will be done in a way that allows
the CD/DVD-Recorder to append additional sessions later.
This is done by generation a TOC with a link to the next
program area. The so generated media is not 100% compatible
to manufactured CDs (except for CDplus). Use only for
recording of multi session CDs. If this option is present,
the default track type is <b>CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1</b> and
the sector size is 2048 bytes. The XA sector subheaders will
be created by the drive. The <i>Sony</i> drives have no
hardware support for <b>CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1</b>. You
have to specify the <b>&minus;data</b> option in order to
create multi session disks on these drives. As long as wodim
does not have a coder for converting data sectors to audio
sectors, you need to force <b>CD-ROM</b> sectors by
including the <b>&minus;data</b> option if you like to

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not all drives support all
blanking types. It may be necessary to use <b>blank=all</b>
if a drive reports a specified command as being invalid. If
used together with the <b>&minus;force</b> flag, this option
may be used to blank CD-RW disks that otherwise cannot be
blanked. Note that you may need to specify
<b>blank=</b><i>all</i> because some drives will not
continue with certain types of bad CD-RW disks. Note also
that <b>wodim</b> does its best if the <b>&minus;force</b>
flag is used but it finally depends on the drive&rsquo;s
firmware whether the blanking operation will succeed or not.
<b><br>
&minus;format</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Format a CD-RW/DVD-RW/DVD+RW
disc. Formatting is currently only implemented for DVD+RW
media. A &rsquo;maiden&rsquo; DVD+RW media needs to be
formatted before you may write to it. However, as
<b>wodim</b> autodetects the need for formatting in this
case and auto formats the medium before it starts writing,
the <b>&minus;format</b> option is only needed if you like
to forcibly reformat a DVD+RW medium.</p>

<p>Set the FIFO (ring buffer) size to #. You may use the
same syntax as in <b>dd</b>(1), <b>sdd</b>(1) or
<b>star</b>(1). The number representing the size is taken in
bytes unless otherwise specified. If a number is followed
directly by the letter &lsquo;b&rsquo;, &lsquo;k&rsquo;,
&lsquo;m&rsquo;, &lsquo;s&rsquo; or &lsquo;f&rsquo;, the
size is multiplied by 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 2048 or 2352. If
the size consists of numbers separated by &lsquo;x&rsquo; or
&lsquo;*&rsquo;, multiplication of the two numbers is
performed. Thus <i>fs=10x63k</i> will specify a FIFO size of
630&nbsp;kBytes.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The size
specified by the <i>fs=</i> argument includes the shared
memory that is needed for administration. This is at least
one page of memory. If no <i>fs</i>= option is present,
<b>wodim</b> will try to get the FIFO size value from the
<b>CDR_FIFOSIZE</b> environment. The default FIFO size is
currently 4 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The FIFO is
used to increase buffering for the real time writing
process. It allows to run a pipe from <b>genisoimage</b>
directly into <b>wodim</b>. If the FIFO is active and a pipe
from <b>genisoimage</b> into <b>wodim</b> is used to create
a CD, <b>wodim</b> will abort prior to do any modifications
on the disk if <b>genisoimage</b> dies before it starts
writing. The recommended FIFO size is between 4 and
128&nbsp;MBytes. As a rule of thumb, the FIFO size should be
at least equal to the size of the internal buffer of the
CD/DVD-Recorder and no more than half of the physical amount
of RAM available in the machine. If the FIFO size is big
enough, the FIFO statistics will print a FIFO empty count of
zero and the FIFO min fill is not below 20%. It is not wise
to use too much space for the FIFO. If you need more than 8
MB to write a CD at a speed less than 20x from an image on a
local file system on an idle machine, your machine is either
underpowered, has hardware problems or is mis-configured. If
you like to write DVDs or CDs at higher speed, it makes
sense to use at least 16&nbsp;MB for the FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On old and
small machines, you need to be more careful with the FIFO
size. If your machine has less than 256&nbsp;MB of physical
RAM, you should not set up a FIFO size that is more than
32&nbsp;MB. The sun4c architecture (e.g. a Sparcstation-2)
has only MMU page table entries for 16&nbsp;MBytes per
process. Using more than 14&nbsp;MBytes for the FIFO may
cause the operating system in this case to spend much time
to constantly reload the MMU tables. Newer machines from Sun
do not have this MMU hardware problem. I have no information
on PC-hardware reflecting this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Old Linux
systems for non x86 platforms have broken definitions for
the shared memory size. You need to fix them and rebuild the
kernel or manually tell <b>wodim</b> to use a smaller
FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
buffer underruns or similar problems (like a constantly
empty drive buffer) and observe a zero <i>fifo empty
count</i>, you have hardware problems that prevents the data
from flowing fast enough from the kernel memory to the
drive. The FIFO size in this case is sufficient, but you
should check for a working DMA setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dev=</b><i>target</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the SCSI target for the
CD/DVD-Recorder, see notes above. A typical device
specification is <b>dev=</b><i>6,0</i> . A filename or
virtual device name can be passed instead of the symbolic
SCSI numbers. The correct device/filename in this case can
be found in the system specific manuals of the target
operating system. On a <i>FreeBSD</i> system without
<i>CAM</i> support, you need to use the control device (e.g.
<i>/dev/rcd0.ctl</i>). A correct device specification in
this case may be <b>dev=</b><i>/dev/rcd0.ctl:@</i> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux and
Windows 2000/XP, drives are accessible with their device (or

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>timeout=</b><i>#</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the default SCSI command
timeout value to <i>#</i> seconds. The default SCSI command
timeout is the minimum timeout used for sending SCSI
commands. If a SCSI command fails due to a timeout, you may
try to raise the default SCSI command timeout above the
timeout value of the failed command. If the command runs
correctly with a raised command timeout, please report the
better timeout value and the corresponding command to the
author of the program. If no <i>timeout</i> option is
present, a default timeout of 40 seconds is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>driver=</b><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows the user to manually
select a driver for the device. The reason for the existence
of the <b>driver=</b><i>name</i> option is to allow users to
use <b>wodim</b> with drives that are similar to supported
drives but not known directly by <b>wodim</b>. All drives
made after 1997 should be MMC standard compliant and thus
supported by one of the MMC drivers. It is most unlikely
that <b>wodim</b> is unable to find the right driver
automatically. Use this option with extreme care. If a wrong
driver is used for a device, the possibility of creating
corrupted disks is high. The minimum problem related to a
wrong driver is that the <b>speed=</b> or
<b>&minus;dummy</b> will not work.</p>

would otherwise select the <b>mmc_cdr</b> driver but the
device seems to be made by Sony. The <b>mmc_cdr_sony</b> is
definitely needed for the Sony CDU 928 as this drive does
not completely implement the MMC standard and some of the
MMC SCSI commands have to be replaced by Sony proprietary
commands. It seems that all Sony drives (even newer ones)
still implement the Sony proprietary SCSI commands so it has
not yet become a problem to use this driver for all Sony
drives. If you find a newer Sony drive that does not work
with this driver, please report.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>mmc_mdvd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The generic SCSI-3/mmc-2
DVD-R/DVD-RW driver is auto-selected whenever <b>wodim</b>
finds a MMC-2 or MMC-3 compliant drive that supports to
write DVDs and an appropriate medium is loaded. Note that
for unknown reason, the DVD-Plus alliance does not like that
there is a simulation mode for DVD+R and DVD+RW media nor a
way to erase DVD+RW media. DVD+R and DVD+RW only supports
one write mode that is somewhere between Track At Once and
Packet writing; this mode is selected in <b>wodim</b> via a
the <b>&minus;dao</b>/<b>&minus;sao</b> option. As DVD+RW
media needs to be formatted before its first use,
<b>wodim</b> auto-detects this media state and performs a
format before it starts to write.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Note: If you

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>teac_cdr50</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The driver for Teac CD-R50S,
Teac CD-R55S, JVC XR-W2010, Pinnacle RCD-5020 is
auto-selected whenever one of the drives is found that is
known to the non MMC command set used by TEAC and JVC. Note
that many drives from JVC will not work because they do not
correctly implement the documented command set and JVC has
been unwilling to fix or document the bugs. There is no

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>cdr_simul</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The simulation CD-R driver
allows to run timing and speed tests with parameters that
match the behavior of CD writers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>dvd_simul</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The simulation DVD-R driver
allows to run timing and speed tests with parameters that
match the behavior of DVD writers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
special driver entries in the list: <b>cdr_simul</b> and
<b>dvd_simul</b>. These driver entries are designed to make
timing tests at any speed or timing tests for drives that do
not support the <b>&minus;dummy</b> option. The simulation
drivers implement a drive with a buffer size of 1&nbsp;MB
that can be changed via the <b>CDR_SIMUL_BUFSIZE</b>
environment variable. The simulation driver correctly
simulates even a buffer underrun condition. If the
<b>&minus;dummy</b> option is present, the simulation is not
aborted in case of a buffer underrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>driveropts=</b><i>option
list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set driver specific options.
The options are specified a comma separated list. To get a
list of valid options use <b>driveropts=</b><i>help</i>
together with the <i>&minus;checkdrive</i> option. If you
like to set driver options without running a typical
<b>wodim</b> task, you need to use the
<b>&minus;setdropts</b> option in addition, otherwise the
command line parser in <b>wodim</b> will complain. Currently
implemented driver options are: <b><br>
burnfree</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn the support for Buffer
Underrun Free writing on. This only works for drives that
support Buffer Underrun Free technology, which is available
on most drives manufactured in this millennium. This may be
called: <b>Sanyo BURN-Proof</b>, <b>Ricoh Just-Link</b>,
<b>Yamaha Lossless-Link</b> or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
deprecated and is mentioned here for documentation purposes
only. The BURN-Free feature is enabled by default if the
drive supports it. However, use of BURN-Free may cause
decreased burning quality. Therefore it can be useful to
disable it for certain purposes, eg. when creating a master
copy for mass CD production.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>noburnfree</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn the support for Buffer
Underrun Free writing off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>varirec=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn on the <b>Plextor
VariRec</b> writing mode. The mandatory parameter
<i>value</i> is the laser power offset and currently may be
selected from -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. In addition, you need to set
the write speed to 4 in order to allow <b>VariRec</b> to
work.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>gigarec=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Manage the <b>Plextor
GigaRec</b> writing mode. The mandatory parameter
<i>value</i> is the disk capacity ratio compared to normal
recording and currently may be selected from 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4. If values &lt; 1.0 are used, then the
effect is similar to the <b>Yamaha Audio Master Q. R.</b>
feature. If values &gt; 1.0 are used, then the disk capacity
is increased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Not all drives
support all <b>GigaRec</b> values. When a drive uses the
<b>GigaRec</b> feature, the write speed is limited to
8x.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>audiomaster</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn on the <b>Yamaha Audio
Master Q. R.</b> feature which usually should result in high
quality CDs that have less reading problems in Hi-Fi
players. As this is implemented as a variant of the Session
at Once write mode, it will only work if you select SAO
write mode and there is no need to turn it off. The <b>Audio
Master</b> mode will work with a limited speed but may also
be used with data CDs. In <b>Audio Master</b> mode, the pits
on the CD will be written larger then usual so the capacity
of the medium is reduced when turning this feature on. A 74
minute CD will only have a capacity of 63 minutes if
<b>Audio Master</b> is active and the capacity of a 80
minute CD will be reduced to 68 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>forcespeed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Normally, modern drives know
the highest possible speed for different media and may
reduce the speed in order to grant best write quality. This
technology may be called: <b>Plextor PowerRec</b>, <b>Ricoh
Just-Speed</b>, <b>Yamaha Optimum Write Speed Control</b> or
similar. Some drives (e.g. Plextor, Ricoh and Yamaha) allow
to force the drive to use the selected speed even if the
medium is so bad that the write quality would be poor. This
option tells such a drive to force to use the selected speed
regardless of the medium quality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Use this option
with extreme care and note that the drive should know better
which medium will work at full speed. The default is to turn
<b>forcespeed</b> off, regardless of the defaults of the
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>noforcespeed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn off the <b>force speed</b>
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>speedread</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Some ultra high speed drives
such as 48x and faster drives from Plextor limit the read
speed for unknown media to e.g. 40x in order to avoid
damaged disks and drives. Using this option tells the drive
to read any media as fast as possible. Be very careful as
this may cause the media to break in the drive while
reading, resulting in a damaged media and drive!</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>nospeedread</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn off unlimited read
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>singlesession</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn the drive into a single
session only drive. This allows to read defective or
non-compliant (illegal) media with extremely non-standard
additional (broken/illegal) TOC entries in the TOC from the
second or higher session. Some of these disks become usable
if only the information from the first session is used. You
need to enable Single Session mode before you insert the
defective disk!</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>nosinglesession</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn off single session mode.
The drive will again behave as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>hidecdr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Hide the fact that a medium
might be a recordable medium. This allows to make CD-Rs look
like CD-ROMs and applications believe that the media in the
drive is not a CD-R.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>nohidecdr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Turn off hiding CD-R media.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>tattooinfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Use this option together with
<b>&minus;checkdrive</b> to retrieve the image size
information for the <b>Yamaha DiskT@2</b> feature. The
images always have a line length of 3744 pixel. Line number
0 (radius 0) is mapped to the center of the disk. If you
know the inner and outer radius you will be able to create a
pre distorted image that later may appear undistorted on the
disk.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>tattoofile=</b><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Use this option together with
<b>&minus;checkdrive</b> to write an image prepared for the
<b>Yamaha DiskT@2</b> feature to the medium. The file must
be a file with raw image B&amp;W data (one byte per pixel)
in a size as retrieved by a previous call to
<b>tattoofile=</b><i>name</i> . If the size of the image
equals the maximum possible size (3744 x 320 pixel),
<b>wodim</b> will use the first part of the file. This first
part then will be written to the leftover space on the
CD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the

is 90 seconds (6750 sectors) and a disk usually works if
there are at least 150 sectors of lead out, all media may be
overburned by at least 88 seconds (6600 sectors). Most CD
recorders only do overburning in <b>SAO</b> or <b>RAW</b>
mode. Known exceptions are TEAC CD-R50S, TEAC CD-R55S and
the Panasonic CW-7502. Some drives do not allow to overburn
as much as you might like and limit the size of a CD to e.g.
76 minutes. This problem may be circumvented by writing the
CD in RAW mode because this way the drive has no chance to

<h2>NOTES

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Solaris you
need to stop the volume management if you like to use the
USCSI fallback SCSI transport code. Even things like
<b>wodim -scanbus</b> will not work if the volume management
is running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Disks made in
<b>Track At Once</b> mode are not suitable as a master for
direct mass production by CD manufacturers. You will need
the <b>disk at once</b> option to record such disks.
Nevertheless the disks made in <b>Track At Once</b> will
normally be read in all CD players. Some old audio CD
players however may produce a two second click between two
audio tracks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The minimal
size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors. If you write
smaller tracks, the CD-Recorder will add dummy blocks. This
is not an error, even though the SCSI-error message looks
this way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Yamaha
CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming drives are
supported in single and multi-session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should run
several tests in all supported speeds of your drive with the
<b>&minus;dummy</b> option turned on if you are using
<b>wodim</b> on an unknown system. Writing a CD is a
real-time process. <b>NFS, CIFS</b> and other network file
systems won&rsquo;t always deliver constantly the needed
data rates. If you want to use <b>wodim</b> with CD-images
that are located on a <b>NFS</b> mounted filesystem, be sure
that the FIFO size is big enough. If you want to make sure
that buffer underruns are not caused by your source disk,
you may use the command</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wodim -dummy
dev=2,0 padsize=600m /dev/null</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to create a
disk that is entirely made of dummy data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
cases where you either need to be root or install
<b>wodim</b> executable with suid-root permissions. First,
if you are using a device manufactured before 1999 which
requires a non-MMC driver, you should run <b>wodim</b> in
dummy mode before writing data. If you find a problem doing
this, please report it to the <b>cdrkit</b> maintainers (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Second, certain
functionality may be unusable because of Linux&rsquo;s SCSI
command filtering. When using <b>wodim</b> for anything
except of pure data writing, you should also test the
process in dummy mode and report trouble to the contact
address below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you still
want to run <b>wodim</b> with root permissions, you can set
the permissions of the executable to suid-root. See the
additional notes of your system/program distribution or
README.suidroot which is part of the cdrkit source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should not
connect old drives that do not support disconnect/reconnect
to either the SCSI bus that is connected to the CD-Recorder
or the source disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Compact Disc
can have no more than 99 tracks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When creating a
disc with both audio and data tracks, the data should be on
track 1 otherwise you should create a CDplus disk which is a
multi session disk with the first session containing the
audio tracks and the following session containing the data
track.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many operating
systems are not able to read more than a single data track,
or need special software to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
more information or SCSI command manuals for currently
unsupported CD/DVD/BR/HD-DVD-Recorders, please contact the
<b>cdrkit</b> maintainers (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many CD
recorders have bugs and often require a firmware update to
work correctly. If you experience problems which cannot be
solved or explained by the notes above, please look for
instructions on the homepage of the particular
manufacturer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some bugs will
force you to power cycle the device or to reboot the
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The FIFO
percent output is computed just after a block of data has
been written to the CD/DVD-Recorder. For this reason, there
will never be 100% FIFO fill ratio while the FIFO is in
streaming mode.</p>
