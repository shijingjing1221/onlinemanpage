<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zshroadmap
&minus; informal introduction to the zsh manual</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Zsh Manual,
like the shell itself, is large and often complicated. This
section of the manual provides some pointers to areas of the
shell that are likely to be of particular interest to new
users, and indicates where in the rest of the manual the
documentation is to be found.</p>

<h2>WHEN THE SHELL STARTS
<a name="WHEN THE SHELL STARTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When it starts,
the shell reads commands from various files. These can be
created or edited to customize the shell. See the section
Startup/Shutdown Files in <i>zsh</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no personal
initialization files exist for the current user, a function
is run to help you change some of the most common settings.
It won&rsquo;t appear if your administrator has disabled the
<b>zsh/newuser</b> module. The function is designed to be
self&minus;explanatory. You can run it by hand with
&lsquo;<b>autoload &minus;Uz
zsh&minus;newuser&minus;install;
zsh&minus;newuser&minus;install &minus;f</b>&rsquo;. See
also the section User Configuration Functions in
<i>zshcontrib</i>(1).</p>

<h2>INTERACTIVE USE
<a name="INTERACTIVE USE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interaction
with the shell uses the builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE. This
is described in detail in <i>zshzle</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
decision a user must make is whether to use the Emacs or Vi
editing mode as the keys for editing are substantially
different. Emacs editing mode is probably more natural for
beginners and can be selected explicitly with the command
<b>bindkey &minus;e</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A history
mechanism for retrieving previously typed lines (most simply
with the Up or Down arrow keys) is available; note that,
unlike other shells, zsh will not save these lines when the
shell exits unless you set appropriate variables, and the
number of history lines retained by default is quite small
(30 lines). See the description of the shell variables
(referred to in the documentation as parameters)
<b>HISTFILE</b>, <b>HISTSIZE</b> and <b>SAVEHIST</b> in
<i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shell now
supports the UTF&minus;8 character set (and also others if
supported by the operating system). This is (mostly) handled
transparently by the shell, but the degree of support in
terminal emulators is variable. There is some discussion of
this in the shell FAQ, http://zsh.dotsrc.org/FAQ/ . Note in
particular that for combining characters to be handled the
option <b>COMBINING_CHARS</b> needs to be set. Because the
shell is now more sensitive to the definition of the
character set, note that if you are upgrading from an older
version of the shell you should ensure that the appropriate
variable, either <b>LANG</b> (to affect all aspects of the
shell&rsquo;s operation) or <b>LC_CTYPE</b> (to affect only
the handling of character sets) is set to an appropriate
value. This is true even if you are using a
single&minus;byte character set including extensions of
ASCII such as <b>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1</b> or
<b>ISO&minus;8859&minus;15</b>. See the description of
<b>LC_CTYPE</b> in <i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Completion</b>
<br>
Completion is a feature present in many shells. It allows
the user to type only a part (usually the prefix) of a word
and have the shell fill in the rest. The completion system
in zsh is programmable. For example, the shell can be set to
complete email addresses in arguments to the mail command
from your <b>~/.abook/addressbook</b>; usernames, hostnames,
and even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so on.
Anything that can be written in or glued together with zsh
can be the source of what the line editor offers as possible
completions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Zsh has two
completion systems, an old, so called <b>compctl</b>
completion (named after the builtin command that serves as
its complete and only user interface), and a new one,
referred to as <b>compsys</b>, organized as library of
builtin and user&minus;defined functions. The two systems
differ in their interface for specifying the completion
behavior. The new system is more customizable and is
supplied with completions for many commonly used commands;
it is therefore to be preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The completion
system must be enabled explicitly when the shell starts. For
more information see <i>zshcompsys</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extending
the line editor</b> <br>
Apart from completion, the line editor is highly extensible
by means of shell functions. Some useful functions are
provided with the shell; they provide facilities such as:
<b><br>
insert&minus;composed&minus;char</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">composing characters not found
on the keyboard</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>match&minus;words&minus;by&minus;style</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">configuring what the line
editor considers a word when moving or deleting by word</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>history&minus;beginning&minus;search&minus;backward&minus;end</b>,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">alternative ways of searching
the shell history</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>replace&minus;string</b>,
<b>replace&minus;pattern</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">functions for replacing strings
or patterns globally in the command line</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>edit&minus;command&minus;line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">edit the command line with an
external editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the section
&lsquo;ZLE Functions&rsquo; in <i>zshcontrib</i>(1) for
descriptions of these.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shell has a
large number of options for changing its behaviour. These
cover all aspects of the shell; browsing the full
documentation is the only good way to become acquainted with
the many possibilities. See <i>zshoptions</i>(1).</p>

<h2>PATTERN MATCHING
<a name="PATTERN MATCHING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shell has a
rich set of patterns which are available for file matching
(described in the documentation as &lsquo;filename
generation&rsquo; and also known for historical reasons as
&lsquo;globbing&rsquo;) and for use when programming. These
are described in the section &lsquo;Filename
Generation&rsquo; in <i>zshexpn</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of particular
interest are the following patterns that are not commonly
supported by other systems of pattern matching:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>**</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>for matching over multiple directories</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>~</b>, <b>^</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>the ability to exclude patterns from matching when the
<b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option is set</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the end of
the pattern, which select files by type (such as
directories) or attribute (such as size).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX
<a name="GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
syntax of zsh is in ways similar to the Korn shell, and
therefore more remotely to the original UNIX shell, the
Bourne shell, its default behaviour does not entirely
correspond to those shells. General shell syntax is
introduced in the section &lsquo;Shell Grammar&rsquo; in
<i>zshmisc</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One commonly
encountered difference is that variables substituted onto
the command line are not split into words. See the
description of the shell option <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> in the
section &lsquo;Parameter Expansion&rsquo; in
<i>zshexpn</i>(1). In zsh, you can either explicitly request
the splitting (e.g. <b>${=foo}</b>) or use an array when you
want a variable to expand to more than one word. See the
section &lsquo;Array Parameters&rsquo; in
<i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMING
<a name="PROGRAMMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most
convenient way of adding enhancements to the shell is
typically by writing a shell function and arranging for it
to be autoloaded. Functions are described in the section
&lsquo;Functions&rsquo; in <i>zshmisc</i>(1). Users changing
from the C shell and its relatives should notice that
aliases are less used in zsh as they don&rsquo;t perform
argument substitution, only simple text replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A few general
functions, other than those for the line editor described
above, are provided with the shell and are described in
<i>zshcontrib</i>(1). Features include: <b><br>
promptinit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">a prompt theme system for
changing prompts easily, see the section &lsquo;Prompt
Themes&rsquo;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>zsh&minus;mime&minus;setup</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">a MIME&minus;handling system
which dispatches commands according to the suffix of a file
as done by graphical file managers</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>zcalc</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>a calculator</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>zargs</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>a version of <b>xargs</b> that makes the <b>find</b>
command redundant</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>zmv</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>a command for renaming files by means of shell
patterns.</p> </td></tr>
