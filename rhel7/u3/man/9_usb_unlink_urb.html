<h2>ARGUMENTS
<a name="ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>urb</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">pointer to urb describing a
previously submitted request, may be NULL</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This routine
cancels an in&minus;progress request. URBs complete only
once per submission, and may be canceled only once per
submission. Successful cancellation means termination of
<i>urb</i> will be expedited and the completion handler will
be called with a status code indicating that the request has
been canceled (rather than any other code).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Drivers should
not call this routine or related routines, such as
<b>usb_kill_urb</b> or <b>usb_unlink_anchored_urbs</b>,
after their disconnect method has returned. The disconnect
function should synchronize with a driver's I/O routines to
insure that all URB&minus;related activity has completed
before it returns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This request is
asynchronous, however the HCD might call the
&minus;&gt;<b>complete</b> callback during unlink. Therefore
when drivers call <b>usb_unlink_urb</b>, they must not hold
any locks that may be taken by the completion function.
Success is indicated by returning &minus;EINPROGRESS, at
which time the URB will probably not yet have been given
back to the device driver. When it is eventually called, the
completion function will see <i>urb</i>&minus;&gt;status ==
&minus;ECONNRESET. Failure is indicated by
<b>usb_unlink_urb</b> returning any other value. Unlinking
will fail when <i>urb</i> is not currently
&ldquo;linked&rdquo; (i.e., it was never submitted, or it
was unlinked before, or the hardware is already finished
with it), even if the completion handler has not yet
run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The URB must
not be deallocated while this routine is running. In
particular, when a driver calls this routine, it must insure
that the completion handler cannot deallocate the URB.</p>

<h2>RETURN
<a name="RETURN"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;EINPROGRESS
on success. See description for other values on failure.</p>

<h2>UNLINKING AND ENDPOINT QUEUES
<a name="UNLINKING AND ENDPOINT QUEUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[The behaviors
and guarantees described below do not apply to virtual root
hubs but only to endpoint queues for physical USB
devices.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Host Controller
Drivers (HCDs) place all the URBs for a particular endpoint
in a queue. Normally the queue advances as the controller
hardware processes each request. But when an URB terminates
with an error its queue generally stops (see below), at
least until that URB's completion routine returns. It is
guaranteed that a stopped queue will not restart until all
its unlinked URBs have been fully retired, with their
completion routines run, even if that's not until some time
after the original completion handler returns. The same
behavior and guarantee apply when an URB terminates because
it was unlinked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bulk and
interrupt endpoint queues are guaranteed to stop whenever an
URB terminates with any sort of error, including
&minus;ECONNRESET, &minus;ENOENT, and &minus;EREMOTEIO.
Control endpoint queues behave the same way except that they
are not guaranteed to stop for &minus;EREMOTEIO errors.
Queues for isochronous endpoints are treated differently,
because they must advance at fixed rates. Such queues do not
stop when an URB encounters an error or is unlinked. An
unlinked isochronous URB may leave a gap in the stream of
packets; it is undefined whether such gaps can be filled
in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that early
termination of an URB because a short packet was received
will generate a &minus;EREMOTEIO error if and only if the
URB_SHORT_NOT_OK flag is set. By setting this flag, USB
device drivers can build deep queues for large or complex
bulk transfers and clean them up reliably after any sort of
aborted transfer by unlinking all pending URBs at the first
fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a control
URB terminates with an error other than &minus;EREMOTEIO, it
is quite likely that the status stage of the transfer will
not take place.</p>
