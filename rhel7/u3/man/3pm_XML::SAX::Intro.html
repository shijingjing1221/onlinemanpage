<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">XML::SAX::Intro
&minus; An Introduction to SAX Parsing with Perl</p>

<h2>Introduction
<a name="Introduction"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>XML::SAX</small>
is a new way to work with <small>XML</small> Parsers in
Perl. In this article we&rsquo;ll discuss why you should be
using <small>SAX,</small> why you should be using
<small>XML::SAX,</small> and we&rsquo;ll see some of the
finer implementation details. The text below assumes some
familiarity with callback, or push based parsing, but if you
are unfamiliar with these techniques then a good place to
start is Kip Hampton&rsquo;s excellent series of articles on
<small>XML</small> .com.</p>

<h2>Replacing XML::Parser
<a name="Replacing XML::Parser"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The de-facto
way of parsing <small>XML</small> under perl is to use Larry
Wall and Clark Cooper&rsquo;s XML::Parser. This module is a
Perl and <small>XS</small> wrapper around the expat
<small>XML</small> parser library by James Clark. It has
been a hugely successful project, but suffers from a couple
of rather major flaws. Firstly it is a proprietary
<small>API,</small> designed before the <small>SAX
API</small> was conceived, which means that it is not easily
replaceable by other streaming parsers. Secondly it&rsquo;s
callbacks are subrefs. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like much of
an issue, but unfortunately leads to code like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub handle_start {
    my ($e, $el, %attrs) = @_;
    if ($el eq 'foo') {
      $e&minus;&gt;{inside_foo}++; # BAD! $e is an XML::Parser::Expat object.
    }
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
we&rsquo;re using the <tt>$e</tt> object to hold our state
information, which is a bad idea because we don&rsquo;t own
that object &minus; we didn&rsquo;t create it. It&rsquo;s an
internal object of XML::Parser, that happens to be a
hashref. We could all too easily overwrite XML::Parser
internal state variables by using this, or Clark could
change it to an array ref (not that he would, because it
would break so much code, but he could).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only way
currently with XML::Parser to safely maintain state is to
use a closure:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $state = MyState&minus;&gt;new();
  $parser&minus;&gt;setHandlers(Start =&gt; sub { handle_start($state, @_) });</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This closure
traps the <tt>$state</tt> variable, which now gets passed as
the first parameter to your callback. Unfortunately very few
people use this technique, as it is not documented in the
XML::Parser <small>POD</small> files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another reason
you might not want to use XML::Parser is because you need
some feature that it doesn&rsquo;t provide (such as
validation), or you might need to use a library that
doesn&rsquo;t use expat, due to it not being installed on
your system, or due to having a restrictive
<small>ISP.</small> Using <small>SAX</small> allows you to
work around these restrictions.</p>

<h2>Introducing SAX
<a name="Introducing SAX"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>SAX</small>
stands for the Simple <small>API</small> for
<small>XML.</small> And simple it really is. Constructing a
<small>SAX</small> parser and passing events to handlers is
done as simply as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use XML::SAX;
  use MySAXHandler;
  my $parser = XML::SAX::ParserFactory&minus;&gt;parser(
        Handler =&gt; MySAXHandler&minus;&gt;new
  );
  $parser&minus;&gt;parse_uri(&quot;foo.xml&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The important
concept to grasp here is that <small>SAX</small> uses a
factory class called XML::SAX::ParserFactory to create a new
parser instance. The reason for this is so that you can
support other underlying parser implementations for
different feature sets. This is one thing that XML::Parser
has always sorely lacked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the code
above we see the parse_uri method used, but we could have
equally well called parse_file, parse_string, or
<i>parse()</i>. Please see XML::SAX::Base for what these
methods take as parameters, but don&rsquo;t be fooled into
believing parse_file takes a filename. No, it takes a file
handle, a glob, or a subclass of IO::Handle. Beware.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>SAX</small>
works very similarly to XML::Parser&rsquo;s default callback
method, except it has one major difference: rather than
setting individual callbacks, you create a new class in
which to recieve the callbacks. Each callback is called as a
method call on an instance of that handler class. An example
will best demonstrate this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  package MySAXHandler;
  use base qw(XML::SAX::Base);
  sub start_document {
    my ($self, $doc) = @_;
    # process document start event
  }
  sub start_element {
    my ($self, $el) = @_;
    # process element start event
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, when we
instantiate this as above, and parse some <small>XML</small>
with this as the handler, the methods start_document and
start_element will be called as method calls, so this would
be the equivalent of directly calling:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $object&minus;&gt;start_element($el);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice how this
is different to XML::Parser&rsquo;s calling style, which
calls:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  start_element($e, $name, %attribs);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s the
difference between function calling and method calling which
allows you to subclass <small>SAX</small> handlers which
contributes to <small>SAX</small> being a powerful
solution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
unlike XML::Parser, we have to define a new package in which
to do our processing (there are hacks you can do to make
this uneccessary, but I&rsquo;ll leave figuring those out to
the experts). The biggest benefit of this is that you
maintain your own state variable ($self in the above
example) thus freeing you of the concerns listed above. It
is also an improvement in maintainability &minus; you can
place the code in a separate file if you wish to, and your
callback methods are always called the same thing, rather
than having to choose a suitable name for them as you had to
with XML::Parser. This is an obvious win.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>SAX</small>
parsers are also very flexible in how you pass a handler to
them. You can use a constructor parameter as we saw above,
or we can pass the handler directly in the call to one of
the parse methods:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $parser&minus;&gt;parse(Handler =&gt; $handler,
                 Source =&gt; { SystemId =&gt; &quot;foo.xml&quot; });
  # or...
  $parser&minus;&gt;parse_file($fh, Handler =&gt; $handler);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
flexibility allows for one parser to be used in many
different scenarios throughout your script (though one
shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressure to use this method, as parser
construction is generally not a time consuming process).</p>

<h2>Callback Parameters
<a name="Callback Parameters"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only other
thing you need to know to understand basic
<small>SAX</small> is the structure of the parameters passed
to each of the callbacks. In XML::Parser, all parameters are
passed as multiple options to the callbacks, so for example
the Start callback would be called as my_start($e,
<tt>$name</tt>, <tt>%attributes</tt>), and the
<small>PI</small> callback would be called as
my_processing_instruction($e, <tt>$target</tt>,
<tt>$data</tt>). In <small>SAX,</small> every callback is
passed a hash reference, containing entries that define our
&quot;node&quot;. The key callbacks and the structures they
receive are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>start_element</b>
<br>
The start_element handler is called whenever a parser sees
an opening tag. It is passed an element structure consisting
of: <br>
LocalName</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the element minus
any namespace prefix it may have come with in the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NamespaceURI</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <small>URI</small> of the
namespace associated with this element, or the empty string
for none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attributes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of attributes as
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the element as it
was seen in the document (i.e. including any prefix
associated with it)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Prefix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The prefix used to qualify this
element&rsquo;s namespace, or the empty string if none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Attributes</b> are a hash reference, keyed by what we
have called &quot;James Clark&quot; notation. This means
that the attribute name has been expanded to include any
associated namespace <small>URI,</small> and put together as
{ns}name, where &quot;ns&quot; is the expanded namespace
<small>URI</small> of the attribute if and only if the
attribute had a prefix, and &quot;name&quot; is the
LocalName of the attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
each entry in the attributes hash is another hash structure
consisting of: <br>
LocalName</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the attribute minus
any namespace prefix it may have come with in the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NamespaceURI</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <small>URI</small> of the
namespace associated with this attribute. If the attribute
had no prefix, then this consists of just the empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The attribute&rsquo;s name as
it appeared in the document, including any namespace
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Prefix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The prefix used to qualify this
attribute&rsquo;s namepace, or the empty string if none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value of the attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So a full
example, as output by Data::Dumper might be:</p>
<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  ....</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>end_element</b>
<br>
The end_element handler is called either when a parser sees
a closing tag, or after start_element has been called for an
empty element (do note however that a parser may if it is so
inclined call characters with an empty string when it sees
an empty element. There is no simple way in
<small>SAX</small> to determine if the parser in fact saw an
empty element, a start and end element with no content..</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The end_element
handler receives exactly the same structure as
start_element, minus the Attributes entry. One must note
though that it should not be a reference to the same data as
start_element receives, so you may change the values in
start_element but this will not affect the values later seen
by end_element.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>characters</b>
<br>
The characters callback may be called in serveral
circumstances. The most obvious one is when seeing ordinary
character data in the markup. But it is also called for text
in a <small>CDATA</small> section, and is also called in
other situations. A <small>SAX</small> parser has to make no
guarantees whatsoever about how many times it may call
characters for a stretch of text in an <small>XML</small>
document &minus; it may call once, or it may call once for
every character in the text. In order to work around this it
is often important for the <small>SAX</small> developer to
use a bundling technique, where text is gathered up and
processed in one of the other callbacks. This is not always
necessary, but it is a worthwhile technique to learn, which
we will cover in XML::SAX::Advanced (when I get around to
writing it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The characters
handler is called with a very simple structure &minus; a
hash reference consisting of just one entry: <br>
Data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The text data that was
received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>comment</b>
<br>
The comment callback is called for comment text. Unlike with
<tt>&quot;characters()&quot;</tt>, the comment callback
*must* be invoked just once for an entire comment string. It
receives a single simple structure &minus; a hash reference
containing just one entry: <br>
Data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The text of the comment.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>processing_instruction</b>
<br>
The processing instruction handler is called for all
processing instructions in the document. Note that these
processing instructions may appear before the document root
element, or after it, or anywhere where text and elements
would normally appear within the document, according to the
<small>XML</small> specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The handler is
passed a structure containing just two entries: <br>
Target</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The target of the processing
instrcution</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The text data in the processing
instruction. Can be an empty string for a processing
instruction that has no data element. For example
&lt;?wiggle?&gt; is a perfectly valid processing
instruction.</p>

<h2>Tip of the iceberg
<a name="Tip of the iceberg"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What we have
discussed above is really the tip of the <small>SAX</small>
iceberg. And so far it looks like there&rsquo;s not much of
interest to <small>SAX</small> beyond what we have seen with
XML::Parser. But it does go much further than that, I
promise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">People who hate
Object Oriented code for the sake of it may be thinking here
that creating a new package just to parse something is a
waste when they&rsquo;ve been parsing things just fine up to
now using procedural code. But there&rsquo;s reason to all
this madness. And that reason is <small>SAX</small>
Filters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you saw
right at the very start, to let the parser know about our
class, we pass it an instance of our class as the Handler to
the parser. But now imagine what would happen if our class
could also take a Handler option, and simply do some
processing and pass on our data further down the line? That
in a nutshell is how <small>SAX</small> filters work.
It&rsquo;s Unix pipes for the 21st century!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
downsides to this. Number 1 &minus; writing
<small>SAX</small> filters can be tricky. If you look into
the future and read the advanced tutorial I&rsquo;m writing,
you&rsquo;ll see that Handler can come in several shapes and
sizes. So making sure your filter does the right thing can
be tricky. Secondly, constructing complex filter chains can
be difficult, and simple thinking tells us that we only get
one pass at our document, when often we&rsquo;ll need more
than that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Luckily though,
those downsides have been fixed by the release of two very
cool modules. What&rsquo;s even better is that I
didn&rsquo;t write either of them!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
module is XML::SAX::Base. This is a <small>VITAL SAX</small>
module that acts as a base class for all <small>SAX</small>
parsers and filters. It provides an abstraction away from
calling the handler methods, that makes sure your filter or
parser does the right thing, and it does it
<small>FAST.</small> So, if you ever need to write a
<small>SAX</small> filter, which if you&rsquo;re processing
<small>XML &minus;</small> &gt; <small>XML,</small> or
<small>XML &minus;</small> &gt; <small>HTML,</small> then
you probably do, then you need to be writing it as a
subclass of XML::SAX::Base. Really &minus; this is advice
not to ignore lightly. I will not go into the details of
writing a <small>SAX</small> filter here. Kip Hampton, the
author of XML::SAX::Base has covered this nicely in his
article on <small>XML</small> .com here &lt;
<small>URI</small> &gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To construct
<small>SAX</small> pipelines, Barrie Slaymaker, a long time
Perl hacker whose modules you will probably have heard of or
used, wrote a very clever module called XML::SAX::Machines.
This combines some really clever <small>SAX</small>
filter-type modules, with a construction toolkit for filters
that makes building pipelines easy. But before we see how it
makes things easy, first lets see how tricky it looks to
build complex <small>SAX</small> filter pipelines.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use XML::SAX::ParserFactory;
  use XML::Filter::Filter1;
  use XML::Filter::Filter2;
  use XML::SAX::Writer;
  my $output_string;
  my $writer = XML::SAX::Writer&minus;&gt;new(Output =&gt; \$output_string);
  my $filter2 = XML::SAX::Filter2&minus;&gt;new(Handler =&gt; $writer);
  my $filter1 = XML::SAX::Filter1&minus;&gt;new(Handler =&gt; $filter2);
  my $parser = XML::SAX::ParserFactory&minus;&gt;parser(Handler =&gt; $filter1);
  $parser&minus;&gt;parse_uri(&quot;foo.xml&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a lot
easier with XML::SAX::Machines:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use XML::SAX::Machines qw(Pipeline);
  my $output_string;
  my $parser = Pipeline(
        XML::SAX::Filter1 =&gt; XML::SAX::Filter2 =&gt; \$output_string
        );
  $parser&minus;&gt;parse_uri(&quot;foo.xml&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the main
benefits of XML::SAX::Machines is that the pipelines are
constructed in natural order, rather than the reverse order
we saw with manual pipeline construction. XML::SAX::Machines
takes care of all the internals of pipe construction,
providing you at the end with just a parser you can use (and
you can re-use the same parser as many times as you need
to).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just a final
tip. If you ever get stuck and are confused about what is
being passed from one <small>SAX</small> filter or parser to
the next, then Devel::TraceSAX will come to your rescue.
This perl debugger plugin will allow you to dump the
<small>SAX</small> stream of events as it goes by. Usage is
really very simple just call your perl script that uses
<small>SAX</small> as follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ perl &minus;d:TraceSAX &lt;scriptname&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And preferably
pipe the output to a pager of some sort, such as more or
less. The output is extremely verbose, but should help clear
some issues up.</p>
