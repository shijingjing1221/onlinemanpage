<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS is
routing algorithm designed for large-scale 2D/3D torus
fabrics. The torus-2QoS routing engine can provide the
following functionality on a 2D/3D torus:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">&ndash; Routing
that is free of credit loops. <br>
&ndash; Two levels of Quality of Service (QoS), assuming
switches support eight data VLs and channel adapters support
two data VLs. <br>
&ndash; The ability to route around a single failed switch,
and/or multiple failed links, without</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&ndash; introducing credit
loops, or <br>
&ndash; changing path SL values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">&ndash; Very short run times,
with good scaling properties as fabric size increases.</p>

<h2>UNICAST ROUTING
<a name="UNICAST ROUTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unicast routing
in torus-2QoS is based on Dimension Order Routing (DOR). It
avoids the deadlocks that would otherwise occur in a
DOR-routed torus using the concept of a dateline for each
torus dimension. It encodes into a path SL which datelines
the path crosses, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sl = 0; <br>
for (d = 0; d &lt; torus_dimensions; d++) {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>/* path_crosses_dateline(d) returns 0 or 1 */</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>sl |= path_crosses_dateline(d) &lt;&lt; d;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a 3D torus
this consumes three SL bits, leaving one SL bit unused.
Torus-2QoS uses this SL bit to implement two QoS levels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS also
makes use of the output port dependence of switch SL2VL maps
to encode into one VL bit the information encoded in three
SL bits. It computes in which torus coordinate direction
each inter-switch link &quot;points&quot;, and writes SL2VL
maps for such ports as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for (sl = 0; sl
&lt; 16; sl++) {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>/* cdir(port) computes which torus coordinate
direction</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>* a switch port &quot;points&quot; in; returns 0, 1, or
2</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>*/</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>sl2vl(iport,oport,sl) = 0x1 &amp; (sl &gt;&gt;
cdir(oport));</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, on a
pristine 3D torus, <i>i.e.</i>, in the absence of failed
fabric switches, torus-2QoS consumes eight SL values (SL
bits 0-2) and two VL values (VL bit 0) per QoS level to
provide deadlock-free routing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS
routes around link failure by &quot;taking the long way
around&quot; any 1D ring interrupted by link failure. For
example, consider the 2D 6x5 torus below, where switches are
denoted by [+a-zA-Z]:</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">| | | | | | <br>
4 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
3 --+----+----+----D----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
2 --+----+----I----r----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
1 --m----S----n----T----o----p-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
y=0 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | |</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">x=0 1 2 3 4
5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a pristine
fabric the path from S to D would be S-n-T-r-D. In the event
that either link S-n or n-T has failed, torus-2QoS would use
the path S-m-p-o-T-r-D. Note that it can do this without
changing the path SL value; once the 1D ring m-S-n-T-o-p-m
has been broken by failure, path segments using it cannot
contribute to deadlock, and the x-direction dateline
(between, say, x=5 and x=0) can be ignored for path segments
on that ring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One result of
this is that torus-2QoS can route around many simultaneous
link failures, as long as no 1D ring is broken into disjoint
segments. For example, if links n-T and T-o have both
failed, that ring has been broken into two disjoint
segments, T and o-p-m-S-n. Torus-2QoS checks for such
issues, reports if they are found, and refuses to route such
fabrics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
the case where there are multiple parallel links between a
pair of switches, torus-2QoS will allocate routes across
such links in a round-robin fashion, based on ports at the
path destination switch that are active and not used for
inter-switch links. Should a link that is one of several
such parallel links fail, routes are redistributed across
the remaining links. When the last of such a set of parallel
links fails, traffic is rerouted as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Handling a
failed switch under DOR requires introducing into a path at
least one turn that would be otherwise &quot;illegal&quot;,
<i>i.e.</i>, not allowed by DOR rules. Torus-2QoS will
introduce such a turn as close as possible to the failed
switch in order to route around it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the above
example, suppose switch T has failed, and consider the path
from S to D. Torus-2QoS will produce the path S-n-I-r-D,
rather than the S-n-T-r-D path for a pristine torus, by
introducing an early turn at n. Normal DOR rules will cause
traffic arriving at switch I to be forwarded to switch r;
for traffic arriving from I due to the &quot;early&quot;
turn at n, this will generate an &quot;illegal&quot; turn at
I.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS will
also use the input port dependence of SL2VL maps to set VL
bit 1 (which would be otherwise unused) for y-x, z-x, and
z-y turns, <i>i.e.</i>, those turns that are illegal under
DOR. This causes the first hop after any such turn to use a
separate set of VL values, and prevents deadlock in the
presence of a single failed switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For any given
path, only the hops after a turn that is illegal under DOR
can contribute to a credit loop that leads to deadlock. So
in the example above with failed switch T, the location of
the illegal turn at I in the path from S to D requires that
any credit loop caused by that turn must encircle the failed
switch at T. Thus the second and later hops after the
illegal turn at I (<i>i.e.</i>, hop r-D) cannot contribute
to a credit loop because they cannot be used to construct a
loop encircling T. The hop I-r uses a separate VL, so it
cannot contribute to a credit loop encircling T.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extending this
argument shows that in addition to being capable of routing
around a single switch failure without introducing deadlock,
torus-2QoS can also route around multiple failed switches on
the condition they are adjacent in the last dimension routed
by DOR. For example, consider the following case on a 6x6 2D
torus:</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">| | | | | | <br>
5 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
4 --+----+----+----D----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
3 --+----+----I----u----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
2 --+----+----q----R----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
1 --m----S----n----T----o----p-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
y=0 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | |</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">x=0 1 2 3 4
5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose
switches T and R have failed, and consider the path from S
to D. Torus-2QoS will generate the path S-n-q-I-u-D, with an
illegal turn at switch I, and with hop I-u using a VL with
bit 1 set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a further
example, consider a case that torus-2QoS cannot route
without deadlock: two failed switches adjacent in a
dimension that is not the last dimension routed by DOR; here
the failed switches are O and T:</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">| | | | | | <br>
5 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
4 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
3 --+----+----+----+----D----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
2 --+----+----I----q----r----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
1 --m----S----n----O----T----p-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
y=0 --+----+----+----+----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | |</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">x=0 1 2 3 4
5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a pristine
fabric, torus-2QoS would generate the path from S to D as
S-n-O-T-r-D. With failed switches O and T, torus-2QoS will
generate the path S-n-I-q-r-D, with illegal turn at switch
I, and with hop I-q using a VL with bit 1 set. In contrast
to the earlier examples, the second hop after the illegal
turn, q-r, can be used to construct a credit loop encircling
the failed switches.</p>

<h2>MULTICAST ROUTING
<a name="MULTICAST ROUTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
torus-2QoS uses all four available SL bits, and the three
data VL bits that are typically available in current
switches, there is no way to use SL/VL values to separate
multicast traffic from unicast traffic. Thus, torus-2QoS
must generate multicast routing such that credit loops
cannot arise from a combination of multicast and unicast
path segments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It turns out
that it is possible to construct spanning trees for
multicast routing that have that property. For the 2D 6x5
torus example above, here is the full-fabric spanning tree
that torus-2QoS will construct, where &quot;x&quot; is the
root switch and each &quot;+&quot; is a non-root switch:</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">4 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
3 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
2 +----+----+----x----+----+ <br>
| | | | | | <br>
1 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
y=0 + + + + + +</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">x=0 1 2 3 4
5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For multicast
traffic routed from root to tip, every turn in the above
spanning tree is a legal DOR turn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For traffic
routed from tip to root, and some traffic routed through the
root, turns are not legal DOR turns. However, to construct a
credit loop, the union of multicast routing on this spanning
tree with DOR unicast routing can only provide 3 of the 4
turns needed for the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition, if
none of the above spanning tree branches crosses a dateline
used for unicast credit loop avoidance on a torus, and if
multicast traffic is confined to SL 0 or SL 8 (recall that
torus-2QoS uses SL bit 3 to differentiate QoS level), then
multicast traffic also cannot contribute to the
&quot;ring&quot; credit loops that are otherwise possible in
a torus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS uses
these ideas to create a master spanning tree. Every
multicast group spanning tree will be constructed as a
subset of the master tree, with the same root as the master
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such multicast
group spanning trees will in general not be optimal for
groups which are a subset of the full fabric. However, this
compromise must be made to enable support for two QoS levels
on a torus while preventing credit loops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the presence
of link or switch failures that result in a fabric for which
torus-2QoS can generate credit-loop-free unicast routes, it
is also possible to generate a master spanning tree for
multicast that retains the required properties. For example,
consider that same 2D 6x5 torus, with the link from (2,2) to
(3,2) failed. Torus-2QoS will generate the following master
spanning tree:</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">4 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
3 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
2 --+----+----+ x----+----+-- <br>
| | | | | | <br>
1 + + + + + + <br>
| | | | | | <br>
y=0 + + + + + +</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">x=0 1 2 3 4
5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two things are
notable about this master spanning tree. First, assuming the
x dateline was between x=5 and x=0, this spanning tree has a
branch that crosses the dateline. However, just as for
unicast, crossing a dateline on a 1D ring (here, the ring
for y=2) that is broken by a failure cannot contribute to a
torus credit loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Second, this
spanning tree is no longer optimal even for multicast groups
that encompass the entire fabric. That, unfortunately, is a
compromise that must be made to retain the other desirable
properties of torus-2QoS routing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the event
that a single switch fails, torus-2QoS will generate a
master spanning tree that has no &quot;extra&quot; turns by
appropriately selecting a root switch. In the 2D 6x5 torus
example, assume now that the switch at (3,2), <i>i.e.</i>,
the root for a pristine fabric, fails. Torus-2QoS will
generate the following master spanning tree for that
case:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming the y
dateline was between y=4 and y=0, this spanning tree has a
branch that crosses a dateline. However, again this cannot
contribute to credit loops as it occurs on a 1D ring (the
ring for x=3) that is broken by a failure, as in the above
example.</p>

<h2>TORUS TOPOLOGY DISCOVERY
<a name="TORUS TOPOLOGY DISCOVERY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The algorithm
used by torus-2QoS to construct the torus topology from the
undirected graph representing the fabric requires that the
radix of each dimension be configured via torus-2QoS.conf.
It also requires that the torus topology be
&quot;seeded&quot;; for a 3D torus this requires configuring
four switches that define the three coordinate directions of
the torus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given this
starting information, the algorithm is to examine the cube
formed by the eight switch locations bounded by the corners
(x,y,z) and (x+1,y+1,z+1). Based on switches already placed
into the torus topology at some of these locations, the
algorithm examines 4-loops of inter-switch links to find the
one that is consistent with a face of the cube of switch
locations, and adds its swiches to the discovered topology
in the correct locations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
algorithm is based on examining the topology of 4-loops of
links, a torus with one or more radix-4 dimensions requires
extra initial seed configuration. See torus-2QoS.conf(5) for
details. Torus-2QoS will detect and report when it has
insufficient configuration for a torus with radix-4
dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the event
the torus is significantly degraded, <i>i.e.</i>, there are
many missing switches or links, it may happen that
torus-2QoS is unable to place into the torus some switches
and/or links that were discovered in the fabric, and will
generate a warning in that case. A similar condition occurs
if torus-2QoS is misconfigured, <i>i.e.</i>, the radix of a
torus dimension as configured does not match the radix of
that torus dimension as wired, and many switches/links in
the fabric will not be placed into the torus.</p>

<h2>QUALITY OF SERVICE CONFIGURATION
<a name="QUALITY OF SERVICE CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSM will not
program switchs and channel adapters with SL2VL maps or VL
arbitration configuration unless it is invoked with -Q.
Since torus-2QoS depends on such functionality for correct
operation, always invoke OpenSM with -Q when torus-2QoS is
in the list of routing engines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any quality of
service configuration method supported by OpenSM will work
with torus-2QoS, subject to the following limitations and
considerations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For all routing
engines supported by OpenSM except torus-2QoS, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between QoS level and SL.
Torus-2QoS can only support two quality of service levels,
so only the high-order bit of any SL value used for unicast
QoS configuration will be honored by torus-2QoS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For multicast
QoS configuration, only SL values 0 and 8 should be used
with torus-2QoS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since SL to VL
map configuration must be under the complete control of
torus-2QoS, any configuration via qos_sl2vl, qos_swe_sl2vl,
<i>etc.</i>, must and will be ignored, and a warning will be
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
inter-switch links, Torus-2QoS uses VL values 0-3 to
implement one of its supported QoS levels, and VL values 4-7
to implement the other. For endport links (CA, router,
switch management port), Torus-2QoS uses VL value 0 for one
of its supported QoS levels and VL value 1 to implement the
other. Hard-to-diagnose application issues may arise if
traffic is not delivered fairly across each of these two VL
ranges. For inter-switch links, Torus-2QoS will detect and
warn if VL arbitration is configured unfairly across VLs in
the range 0-3, and also in the range 4-7. Note that the
default OpenSM VL arbitration configuration does not meet
this constraint, so all torus-2QoS users should configure VL
arbitration via qos_ca_vlarb_high, qos_swe_vlarb_high,
qos_ca_vlarb_low, qos_swe_vlarb_low, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
torus-2QoS maps SL values to VL values differently for
inter-switch and endport links. This is why qos_vlarb_high
and qos_vlarb_low should not be used, as using them may
result in VL arbitration for a QoS level being different
across inter-switch links vs. across endport links.</p>

<h2>OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any routing
algorithm for a torus IB fabric must employ path SL values
to avoid credit loops. As a result, all applications run
over such fabrics must perform a path record query to obtain
the correct path SL for connection setup. Applications that
use <b>rdma_cm</b> for connection setup will automatically
meet this requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a change in
fabric topology causes changes in path SL values required to
route without credit loops, in general all applications
would need to repath to avoid message deadlock. Since
torus-2QoS has the ability to reroute after a single switch
failure without changing path SL values, repathing by
running applications is not required when the fabric is
routed with torus-2QoS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS can
provide unchanging path SL values in the presence of subnet
manager failover provided that all OpenSM instances have the
same idea of dateline location. See torus-2QoS.conf(5) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Torus-2QoS will
detect configurations of failed switches and links that
prevent routing that is free of credit loops, and will log
warnings and refuse to route. If &quot;no_fallback&quot; was
configured in the list of OpenSM routing engines, then no
other routing engine will attempt to route the fabric. In
that case all paths that do not transit the failed
components will continue to work, and the subset of paths
that are still operational will continue to remain free of
credit loops. OpenSM will continue to attempt to route the
fabric after every sweep interval, and after any change
(such as a link up) in the fabric topology. When the fabric
components are repaired, full functionality will be
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the event
OpenSM was configured to allow some other engine to route
the fabric if torus-2QoS fails, then credit loops and
message deadlock are likely if torus-2QoS had previously
routed the fabric successfully. Even if the other engine is
capable of routing a torus without credit loops,
applications that built connections with path SL values
granted under torus-2QoS will likely experience message
deadlock under routing generated by a different engine,
unless they repath.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify that
a torus fabric is routed free of credit loops, use
<b>ibdmchk</b> to analyze data collected via <b>ibdiagnet
