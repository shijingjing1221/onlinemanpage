<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE
&minus; empty a table or set of tables</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE [
TABLE ] [ ONLY ] <i>name</i> [ * ] [, ... ] <br>
[ RESTART IDENTITY | CONTINUE IDENTITY ] [ CASCADE |
RESTRICT ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
quickly removes all rows from a set of tables. It has the
same effect as an unqualified <b>DELETE</b> on each table,
but since it does not actually scan the tables it is faster.
Furthermore, it reclaims disk space immediately, rather than
requiring a subsequent <b>VACUUM</b> operation. This is most
useful on large tables.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of a table to truncate. If ONLY is
specified before the table name, only that table is
truncated. If ONLY is not specified, the table and all its
descendant tables (if any) are truncated. Optionally, * can
be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate
that descendant tables are included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RESTART
IDENTITY</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Automatically restart sequences
owned by columns of the truncated table(s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CONTINUE
IDENTITY</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not change the values of
sequences. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CASCADE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Automatically truncate all
tables that have foreign&minus;key references to any of the
named tables, or to any tables added to the group due to
CASCADE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RESTRICT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refuse to truncate if any of
the tables have foreign&minus;key references from tables
that are not listed in the command. This is the default.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You must have
the TRUNCATE privilege on a table to truncate it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
acquires an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock on each table it operates
on, which blocks all other concurrent operations on the
table. When RESTART IDENTITY is specified, any sequences
that are to be restarted are likewise locked exclusively. If
concurrent access to a table is required, then the
<b>DELETE</b> command should be used instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
cannot be used on a table that has foreign&minus;key
references from other tables, unless all such tables are
also truncated in the same command. Checking validity in
such cases would require table scans, and the whole point is
not to do one. The CASCADE option can be used to
automatically include all dependent tables &mdash; but be
very careful when using this option, or else you might lose
data you did not intend to!</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
will not fire any ON DELETE triggers that might exist for
the tables. But it will fire ON TRUNCATE triggers. If ON
TRUNCATE triggers are defined for any of the tables, then
all BEFORE TRUNCATE triggers are fired before any truncation
happens, and all AFTER TRUNCATE triggers are fired after the
last truncation is performed and any sequences are reset.
The triggers will fire in the order that the tables are to
be processed (first those listed in the command, and then
any that were added due to cascading).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
is not MVCC&minus;safe. After truncation, the table will
appear empty to concurrent transactions, if they are using a
snapshot taken before the truncation occurred. See Section
13.5, &ldquo;Caveats&rdquo;, in the documentation for more
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TRUNCATE</b>
is transaction&minus;safe with respect to the data in the
tables: the truncation will be safely rolled back if the
surrounding transaction does not commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When RESTART
IDENTITY is specified, the implied <b>ALTER SEQUENCE
RESTART</b> operations are also done transactionally; that
is, they will be rolled back if the surrounding transaction
does not commit. This is unlike the normal behavior of
<b>ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART</b>. Be aware that if any
additional sequence operations are done on the restarted
sequences before the transaction rolls back, the effects of
these operations on the sequences will be rolled back, but
not their effects on <b>currval()</b>; that is, after the
transaction <b>currval()</b> will continue to reflect the
last sequence value obtained inside the failed transaction,
even though the sequence itself may no longer be consistent
with that. This is similar to the usual behavior of
<b>currval()</b> after a failed transaction.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Truncate the
tables bigtable and fattable:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE
bigtable, fattable;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same, and
also reset any associated sequence generators:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE
bigtable, fattable RESTART IDENTITY;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Truncate the
table othertable, and cascade to any tables that reference
othertable via foreign&minus;key constraints:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE
othertable CASCADE;</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL:2008
standard includes a <b>TRUNCATE</b> command with the syntax
TRUNCATE TABLE <i>tablename</i>. The clauses CONTINUE
IDENTITY/RESTART IDENTITY also appear in that standard, but
have slightly different though related meanings. Some of the
concurrency behavior of this command is left
implementation&minus;defined by the standard, so the above
notes should be considered and compared with other
implementations if necessary.</p>
