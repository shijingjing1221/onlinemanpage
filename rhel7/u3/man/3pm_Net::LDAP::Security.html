<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Net::LDAP</b>
provides ways to address these vulnerabilities: through the
use of <small>LDAPS,</small> or LDAPv3 and
<small>TLS,</small> and/or the use of <small>SASL.</small>
Each of these will be explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does an
<small>LDAP</small> connection work</b> <br>
A normal LDAPv2 or LDAPv3 connection works by the client
connecting directly to port 389 (by default), and then
issuing various <small>LDAP</small> requests like search,
add, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no way
to guarantee that an <small>LDAP</small> client is connected
to the right <small>LDAP</small> server. Hackers could have
poisoned your <small>DNS,</small> so
&rsquo;ldap.example.com&rsquo; could be made to point to
&rsquo;ldap.hacker.com&rsquo;. Or they could have installed
their own server on the correct machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is in the
nature of the <small>LDAP</small> protocol that all
information goes between the client and the server in
&rsquo;plain text&rsquo;. This is a term used by
cryptographers to describe unencrypted and recoverable data,
so even though <small>LDAP</small> can transfer binary
values like <small>JPEG</small> photographs, audio clips and
X.509 certificates, everything is still considered
&rsquo;plain text&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If these
vulnerabilities are an issue to, then you should consider
the other possibilities described below, namely
<small>LDAPS,</small> LDAPv3 and <small>TLS,</small> and
<small>SASL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does an
<small>LDAPS</small> connection work</b> <small><br>
LDAPS</small> is an unofficial protocol. It is to
<small>LDAP</small> what <small>HTTPS</small> is to
<small>HTTP,</small> namely the exact same protocol (but in
this case LDAPv2 or LDAPv3) running over a <i>secured</i>
<small>SSL</small> (&quot;Secure Socket Layer&quot;)
connection to port 636 (by default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all servers
will be configured to listen for <small>LDAPS</small>
connections, but if they do, it will commonly be on a
different port from the normal plain text
<small>LDAP</small> port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<small>LDAPS</small> can <i>potentially</i> solve the
vulnerabilities described above, but you should be aware
that simply &quot;using&quot; <small>SSL</small> is not a
magic bullet that automatically makes your system
&quot;secure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First of all,
<small>LDAPS</small> can solve the problem of verifying that
you are connected to the correct server. When the client and
server connect, they perform a special <small>SSL</small>
&rsquo;handshake&rsquo;, part of which involves the server
and client exchanging cryptographic keys, which are
described using X.509 certificates. If the client wishes to
confirm that it is connected to the correct server, all it
needs to do is verify the server&rsquo;s certificate which
is sent in the handshake. This is done in two ways:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">check that the certificate is
signed (trusted) by someone that you trust, and that the
certificate hasn&rsquo;t been revoked. For instance, the
server&rsquo;s certificate may have been signed by Verisign
(www.verisign.com), and you decide that you want to trust
Verisign to sign legitimate certificates.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>check that the least-significant cn <small>RDN</small>
in the server&rsquo;s certificate&rsquo;s <small>DN</small>
is the fully-qualified hostname of the hostname that you
connected to when creating the <small>LDAPS</small> object.
For example if the server is &lt;cn=ldap.example.com,ou=My
department,o=My company&gt;, then the <small>RDN</small> to
check is cn=ldap.example.com.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can do this
by using the cafile and capath options when creating a
<b>Net::LDAPS</b> object, <i>and</i> by setting the verify
option to &rsquo;require&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent
hackers &rsquo;sniffing&rsquo; passwords and other
information on your connection, you also have to make sure
the encryption algorithm used by the <small>SSL</small>
connection is good enough. This is also something that gets
decided by the <small>SSL</small> handshake &minus; if the
client and server cannot agree on an acceptable algorithm
the connection is not made.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Net::LDAPS</b>
will by default use all the algorithms built into your copy
of OpenSSL, except for ones considered to use
&quot;low&quot; strength encryption, and those using export
strength encryption. You can override this when you create
the <b>Net::LDAPS</b> object using the &rsquo;ciphers&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once
you&rsquo;ve made the secure connection, you should also
check that the encryption algorithm that is actually being
used is one that you find acceptable. Broken servers have
been observed in the field which &rsquo;fail over&rsquo; and
give you an unencrypted connection, so you ought to check
for that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does
<small>LDAP</small> and <small>TLS</small> work</b>
<small><br>
SSL</small> is a good solution to many network security
problems, but it is not a standard. The <small>IETF</small>
corrected some defects in the <small>SSL</small> mechanism
and published a standard called <small>RFC 2246</small>
which describes <small>TLS</small> (&quot;Transport Layer
Security&quot;), which is simply a cleaned up and
standardized version of <small>SSL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can only
use <small>TLS</small> with an LDAPv3 server. That is
because the standard ( <small>RFC 4511</small> ) for
<small>LDAP</small> and <small>TLS</small> requires that the
<i>normal</i> <small>LDAP</small> connection (i.e., on port
389) can be switched on demand from plain text into a
<small>TLS</small> connection. The switching mechanism uses
a special extended <small>LDAP</small> operation, and since
these are not legal in LDAPv2, you can only switch to
<small>TLS</small> on an LDAPv3 connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So the way you
use <small>TLS</small> with LDAPv3 is that you create your
normal LDAPv3 connection using
<tt>&quot;Net::LDAP::new()&quot;</tt>, and then you perform
the switch using
<tt>&quot;Net::LDAP::start_tls()&quot;</tt>. The
<tt>&quot;start_tls()&quot;</tt> method takes pretty much
the same arguments as
<tt>&quot;Net::LDAPS::new()&quot;</tt>, so check above for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does
<small>SASL</small> work</b> <small><br>
SASL</small> is an authentication framework that can be used
by a number of different Internet services, including
LDAPv3. Because it is only a framework, it doesn&rsquo;t
provide any way to authenticate by itself; to actually
authenticate to a service you need to use a specific
<small>SASL</small> <i>mechanism</i>. A number of mechanisms
are defined, such as <small>CRAM&minus;MD5.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of a
mechanism like <small>CRAM&minus;MD5</small> provides a
solution to the password sniffing vulnerability, because
these mechanisms typically do not require the user to send
across a secret (e.g., a password) in the clear across the
network. Instead, authentication is carried out in a clever
way which avoids this, and so prevents passwords from being
sniffed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Net::LDAP</b>
supports <small>SASL</small> using the <b>Authen::SASL</b>
class. Currently the only <b>Authen::SASL</b> subclasses
(i.e., <small>SASL</small> mechanism) available are
<small>CRAM&minus;MD5</small> and
<small>EXTERNAL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
<small>SASL</small> mechanisms provide a general solution to
the sniffing of all data on the network vulnerability, as
they can negotiate confidential (i.e., encrypted) network
connections. Note that this is over and above any
<small>SSL</small> or <small>TLS</small> encryption!
Unfortunately, perl&rsquo;s <b>Authen::SASL</b> code cannot
negotiate this.</p>
