<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCAP Security
Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and
associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The project
provides practical security hardening advice for Red Hat
products, and also links it to compliance requirements in
order to ease deployment activities, such as certification
and accreditation. These include requirements in the U.S.
government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as
well as of the financial services and health care
industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted
policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose stating that
System Administrators must audit &quot;privileged user
actions,&quot; but do not define what &quot;privileged
actions&quot; are. The SSG bridges the gap between
generalized policy requirements and specific implementation
guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 SSG content is broken into
&rsquo;profiles,&rsquo; groupings of security settings that
correlate to a known policy. Available profiles are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>stig-rhel6-server-upstream</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The Security Technical
Implementation Guides (STIGs) and the NSA Guides are the
configuration standards for DOD IA and IA-enabled
devices/systems. Since 1998, DISA Field Security Operations
(FSO) has played a critical role enhancing the security
posture of DoD&rsquo;s security systems by providing the
Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). This
profile was created as a collaboration effort between the
National Security Agency, DISA FSO, and Red Hat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As a result of
the upstream/downstream relationship between the SCAP
Security Guide project and the official DISA FSO STIG
baseline, users should expect variance between SSG and DISA
FSO content. For additional information relating to STIGs,
please refer to the DISA FSO webpage at
http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">While this
profile is packaged by Red Hat as part of the SCAP Security
Guide package, please note that commercial support of this
SCAP content is NOT available. This profile is provided as
example SCAP content with no endorsement for suitability or
production readiness. Support for this profile is provided
by the upstream SCAP Security Guide community on a
best-effort basis. The upstream project homepage is
https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>usgcb-rhel6-server</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The purpose of the United
States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) initiative
is to create security configuration baselines for
Information Technology products widely deployed across the
federal agencies. The USGCB baseline evolved from the
Federal Desktop Core Configuration mandate. The USGCB is a
Federal government-wide initiative that provides guidance to
agencies on what should be done to improve and maintain an
effective configuration settings focusing primarily on
security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b>
While the current content maps to USGCB requirements, it has
NOT been validated by NIST as of yet. This content should be
considered draft, we are highly interested in feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For additional
information relating to USGCB, please refer to the NIST

<h2>STATEMENT OF SUPPORT
<a name="STATEMENT OF SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SCAP
Security Guide, an open source project jointly maintained by
Red Hat and the NSA, provides XCCDF and OVAL content for Red
Hat technologies. As an open source project, community
participation extends into U.S. Department of Defense
agencies, civilian agencies, academia, and other industrial
partners.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCAP Security
Guide is provided to consumers through Red Hat&rsquo;s
Extended Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository. As
such, SCAP Security Guide content is considered &quot;vendor
provided.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that while
Red Hat hosts the infrastructure for this project and Red
Hat engineers are involved as maintainers and leaders, there
is no commercial support contracts or service level
agreements provided by Red Hat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support, for
both users and developers, is provided through the SCAP
Security Guide community.</p>

<a name="DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCAP Security
Guide content is considered vendor (Red Hat) provided
content. Per guidance from the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Government programs
are allowed to use Vendor produced SCAP content in absence
of &quot;Governmental Authority&quot; checklists. The

<h2>DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. MILITARY SYSTEMS
<a name="DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. MILITARY SYSTEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DoD Directive
(DoDD) 8500.1 requires that &quot;all IA and IA-enabled IT
products incorporated into DoD information systems shall be
configured in accordance with DoD-approved security
configuration guidelines&quot; and tasks Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) to &quot;develop and provide security
configuration guidance for IA and IA-enabled IT products in
coordination with Director, NSA.&quot; The output of this
authority is the DISA Security Technical Implementation
Guides, or STIGs. DISA FSO is in the process of moving the
STIGs towards the use of the NIST Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to &quot;automate&quot;
compliance reporting of the STIGs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Through a
common, shared vision, the SCAP Security Guide community
enjoys close collaboration directly with NSA and DISA FSO.
As stated in Section 1.1 of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
STIG Overview, Version 1, Release 2, issued on
03-JUNE-2013:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;The
consensus content was developed using an open-source project
called SCAP Security Guide. The project&rsquo;s website is
https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/. Except for
differences in formatting to accomodate the DISA STIG
publishing process, the content of the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 STIG should mirrot the SCAP Security Guide content
with only minor divergence as updates from multiple sources
work through the concensus process.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DoD STIG
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was released June 2013.
Currently, the DoD Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG contains
only XCCDF content and is available online:
http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/red-hat.aspx</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Content
published against the iase.disa.mil website is authoritative
STIG content. The SCAP Security Guide project, as noted in
the STIG overview, is considered upstream content. Unlike
DISA FSO, the SCAP Security Guide project does publish OVAL
automation content. Individual programs and C&amp;A
evaluators make program-level determinations on the direct
usage of the SCAP Security Guide. Currently there is no
blanket approval.</p>
