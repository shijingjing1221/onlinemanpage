<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bmc-config</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bmc-config</b>
is used to get and set BMC configuration parameters, such as
usernames, passwords, networking information, security,
Serial-over-LAN (SOL), and other core IPMI fields. This
configuration is required before most IPMI tools can be used
to access a machine remotely. The majority of configuration
operations require ADMIN privilege when using
<b>bmc-config</b> out-of-band. Although connecting via a
user with ADMIN privileges is not required for out-of-band
use, the vast majority of configuration options will not be
retrieved or set. For configuration of chassis, platform
event filtering (PEF), or sensors, please see the
<b>ipmi-chassis-config(8), ipmi-pef-config(8),</b> or
<b>ipmi-sensors-config(8)</b> tools respectively. For some
OEM specific configurations, please see
<b>ipmi-oem(8).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listed below
are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble
shooting information, workaround information, examples, and
known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please
see <b>freeipmi(7).</b> See GENERAL USE below for a
description on how most will want to use
<b>Bmc-config.</b></p>

<h2>HOSTRANGED OPTIONS
<a name="HOSTRANGED OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options manipulate hostranged output. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
below for additional information on hostranges. <b><br>
&minus;B</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;buffer-output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Buffer hostranged output. For
each node, buffer standard output until the node has
completed its IPMI operation. When specifying this option,
data may appear to output slower to the user since the the
entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be
output. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;consolidate-output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Consolidate hostranged output.
The complete standard output from every node specified will
be consolidated so that nodes with identical output are not
output twice. A header will list those nodes with the
consolidated output. When this option is specified, no
output can be seen until the IPMI operations to all nodes
has completed. If the user breaks out of the program early,
all currently consolidated output will be dumped. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;F</b> <i>NUM</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;fanout</b>=<i>NUM</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify multiple host fanout. A
&quot;sliding window&quot; (or fanout) algorithm is used for
parallel IPMI communication so that slower nodes or timed
out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
maximum number of threads available at the same time is
limited by the fanout. The default is 64.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;E</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;eliminate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Eliminate hosts determined as
undetected by <b>ipmidetect.</b> This attempts to remove the
common issue of hostranged execution timing out due to
several nodes being removed from service in a large cluster.
The <b>ipmidetectd</b> daemon must be running on the node
executing the command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;always&minus;prefix</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Always prefix output, even if
only one host is specified or communicating in-band. This
option is primarily useful for scripting purposes. Option
will be ignored if specified with the <b>&minus;C</b>
option.</p>

<h2>GENERAL USE
<a name="GENERAL USE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most users of
will want to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A) Run with
--checkout to get a copy of the current configuration and
store it in a file. The standard output can be redirected to
a file or a file can be specified with the --filename
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">B) Edit the
configuration file with an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">C) Commit the
configuration back using the --commit option and specifying
the configuration file with the --filename option. The
configuration can be committed to multiple hosts in parallel
via the hostrange support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although not
typically necessarily, some motherboards do not store
configuration values in non-volatile memory. Therefore,
after system reboots, some configuration values may have
changed. The user may wish to run configuration tools on
each boot to ensure configuration values remain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments
throughout the checked out file will give instructions on
how to configure the fields. The <b>bmc-config.conf(5)</b>
manpage also provides additional information on the meaning
of different fields.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For users with
large clusters or sets of nodes, you may wish to use the
same configuration file for all nodes. The one problem with
this is that the IP address and MAC address will be
different on each node in your cluster and thus can&rsquo;t
be configured through the same config file. The IP address
and MAC address in your config file may be overwritten on
the command line using --key-pair option. The following
example could be used in a script to configure each node in
a cluster with the same BMC config file. The script only
needs to determine the correct IP address and MAC address to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b># bmc-config
--commit -k Lan_Conf:Ip_Address=$MY_IP -k
Lan_Conf:Mac_Address=$MY_MAC -n my_bmc.conf</b></p>

<h2>BMC-CONFIG SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION
<a name="BMC-CONFIG SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>UserN:Password</b> fields (where N is a number) cannot be
checked out on some systems, therefore the checked out value
will always be blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>UserN:Enable_User</b> field (where N is a number) cannot
be checked out on older IPMI systems, therefore the checked
out value will sometime be blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>UserN:Lan_Session_Limit</b> and
<b>UserN:Serial_Session_Limit</b> fields (where N is a
number) cannot be checked out on some systems, therefore the
checked out value will always be blank. If not specified in
later commits of configurations, the field may be reset to 0
due to a requirement that other fields (configured along
with the session limit) will require an input value for the
session limit. Under most conditions, it is not necessary to
set this field and most users may choose to ignore it. This
field is considered optional by IPMI standards, and may
result in errors when attempting to configure it to a
non-zero value. If errors to occur, setting the value back
to 0 should resolve problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fields
<b>Lan_Conf:IP_Address</b> and <b>Lan_Conf:MAC_Address</b>
cannot be committed in parallel via hostrange support. Each
machine must be configured with a unique IP Address and MAC
Address tuple, therefore we disallow this configuration in
<b>bmc-config.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, <b>Lan_Conf:MAC_Address</b> may be read only
and the MAC address is automatically configured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, <b>Lan_Conf:MAC_Address</b> may be read only
and the MAC address is configured via an OEM command. See
<b>ipmi-oem(8)</b> to see if OEM configuration for your
motherboard is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, a number of user configuration fields cannot
be read or configured until after a non-null username or
non-null password is configured. In some of these cases, an
appropriate output in the config file will indicate this
situation. However, not all motherboard corner cases may be
detected. Users may wish to play around with the ordering of
fields to work around these problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, OEM Authentication in <b>Lan_Conf_Auth</b>
cannot be enabled. However, the default motherboard settings
have these fields enabled. Users are advised to disable all
OEM Authentication in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, multiple channels may exist for either LAN or
Serial IPMI communication. If multiple channels exist,
configuration of both channels can be viewed and ultimately
configured by running <i>&minus;&minus;checkout</i> under
verbose mode. Each section or key name will be suffixed
appropriately with the word <i>Channel</i> and the channel
number. For example, you might see a
<i>Lan_Conf_Channel_1</i> and <i>Lan_Conf_Channel_3</i>,
where you can configure LAN configuration on Channels 1 and
3 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
motherboards, configuration changes will not be
&quot;absorbed&quot; by the system until the motherboard is
hard-reset. This can be accomplished by physically powering
off and on the system (e.g. button push), or it can be
accomplished through a cold-reset. A cold-reset can be
executed via <b>bmc-device.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple hosts
can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of
hosts or a range of hostnames in the general form:
prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n &lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The
later form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19]
does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a
degenerate range: foo19.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This range
syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges
should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9
could be specified as such, or by the range foo[1,9].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some examples
of range usage follow: <br>
foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 <br>
foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10 <br>
foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a reminder
to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ])
for pattern matching. Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When multiple
hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be executed
for each host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which
can be adjusted via the <b>&minus;F</b> option). This will
allow communication to large numbers of nodes far more
quickly than if done in serial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
standard output from each node specified will be output with
the hostname prepended to each line. Although this output is
readable in many situations, it may be difficult to read in
other situations. For example, output from multiple nodes
may be mixed together. The <b>&minus;B</b> and
<b>&minus;C</b> options can be used to change this
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In-band IPMI
Communication will be used when the host
&quot;localhost&quot; is specified. This allows the user to
add the localhost into the hostranged output.</p>

<h2>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most often,
IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN
problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote
machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC:
IP address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
<b>bmc-config(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change
these configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inband IPMI
problems are typically caused by improperly configured
drivers or non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below
to also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listed below
are many of the common issues for error messages. For
additional support, please e-mail the
&lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;username
invalid&quot; - The username entered (or a NULL username if
none was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It
may also be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username
configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;password
invalid&quot; - The password entered (or a NULL password if
none was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible
the password for the user is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;password
verification timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed
out. A &quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above)
or a generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g
invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if
none was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible
the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try
to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require
authenticating to a different user which has a higher
maximum privilege.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level cannot be obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than
the maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a
lower privilege. It may also be possible the maximum
privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication
type unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try again with an
alternate authentication type or alternate privilege level.
It may also be possible the available authentication types
you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on
the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher
suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be
possible the available cipher suite ids are not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0
unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the
remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection
timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number
of potential errors are possible, including an invalid
hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved,
IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the network
connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and
connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;session
timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed out. Please
reconnect. If this error occurs often, you may wish to
increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are
considerably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;device
not found&quot; - The specified device could not be found.
Please check configuration or inputs and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver
timeout&quot; - Communication with the driver or device has
timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;message
timeout&quot; - Communication with the driver or device has
timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC
busy&quot; - The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing
information or have too many simultaneous sessions to
manage. Please wait and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;could not
find inband device&quot; - An inband device could not be
found. Please check configuration or specify specific device
or driver on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;driver
timeout&quot; - The inband driver has timed out
communicating to the local BMC or service processor. The BMC
or service processor may be busy or (worst case) possibly
non-functioning.</p>

<h2>WORKAROUNDS
<a name="WORKAROUNDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With so many
different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,
different vendors may implement their IPMI protocols
incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds
currently available to handle discovered compliance issues.
When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
will be transparent to the user. However, some will require
the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hardware
listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem
was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may
or may not exhibit the same problems. Different vendors may
license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware
developer, so it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed
below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
your hardware has an additional compliance issue that needs
a workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI
maintainers on &lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi&minus;devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>assumeio</i>
- This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces
communicate with system I/O rather than being memory-mapped.
This will work around systems that report invalid base
addresses. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;device not
supported&quot; or &quot;could not find inband device&quot;
errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>spinpoll</i>
- This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers (most
notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling rather than
putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve
the wall clock running time of tools because an operating
system scheduler&rsquo;s granularity may be much larger than
the time it takes to perform a single IPMI message
transaction. However, by spinning, your system may be
performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool
for a more useful task.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>authcap</i>
- This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support
and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around
multiple issues in which the remote system does not properly
report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>nochecksumcheck</i>
- This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums due to
implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise valid.
Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it removes
validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances.
However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most situations.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;connection
timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;, or
&quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. On IPMI
1.5 connections, the &quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround
may also needed too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF,
Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>idzero</i> -
This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be
accepted by the client. It works around IPMI sessions that
report empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>unexpectedauth</i>
- This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null
authcodes to be checked as though they were expected. It
works around an issue when packets contain non-null
authentication data when they should be null due to disabled
per-message authentication. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Dell
PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer
firmware.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>forcepermsg</i>
- This workaround flag will force per-message authentication
to be used no matter what is advertised by the remote
system. It works around an issue when per-message
authentication is advertised as disabled on the remote
system, but it is actually required for the protocol. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>endianseq</i>
- This workaround flag will flip the endian of the session
sequence numbers to allow the session to continue properly.
It works around IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are
the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on some
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor endian).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>noauthcodecheck</i>
- This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
authentication codes returned from IPMI 1.5 command
responses. It works around systems that return invalid
authentication codes due to hashing or implementation
errors. Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it
removes an authentication check verifying the validity of a
packet. However, in most organizations, this is unlikely to
be a security issue. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;connection timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;,
or &quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Xyratex FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>intel20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management
Module (Professional Edition).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>supermicro20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro
IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon
IPMI firmware. The issues covered include handling invalid
length authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed
on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sun20</i> -
This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround automatically includes the
&quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>opensesspriv</i>
- This workaround flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s
IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid
hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege
level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g
invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status code&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM,
Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro
X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel
S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN.
This workaround is automatically triggered with the
&quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>integritycheckvalue</i>
- This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity
check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when
using Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be
0 length, however the remote motherboard responds with a
non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;k_g
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG,
Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and
Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No IPMI 1.5
Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have been
found to not support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; or &quot;connection
timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be worked around by
using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;driver&minus;type</b>=<i>LAN_2_0</i>. Issue
observed on HP Proliant DL 145.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>slowcommit</i>
- This workaround will slow down commits to the BMC by
sleeping one second between the commit of sections. It works
around motherboards that have BMCs that can be overwhelmed
by commits. Those hitting this issue may see commit errors
or commits not being written to the BMC. Issue observed on
Supermicro H8QME.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>veryslowcommit</i>
- This workaround will slow down commits to the BMC by
sleeping one second between the commit of every key. It
works around motherboards that have BMCs that can be
overwhelmed by commits. Those hitting this issue may see
commit errors or commits not being written to the BMC. Issue
observed on Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>solchannelassumelanchannel</i>
- This workaround will force <b>bmc-config</b> to assume
that the channel used SOL is identical to the channel used
for LAN. On some motherboards, the SOL channel is reported
incorrectly, leading to incorrect configuration. Most
notably, this problem has come up when attempting to
configure multiple channels. Issue observed on Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700.</p>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES
<a name="KNOWN ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
operating systems, if you input your username, password, and
other potentially security relevant information on the
command line, this information may be discovered by other
users when using tools like the <b>ps(1)</b> command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information
in the FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an
appropriate way to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
&quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote authentication
