<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">variables -
Format of specifying variable names to SNMP tools.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax and
semantics of management information in SNMP is given by the
definitions of MIB objects, loaded from one or more MIB
files (or &quot;MIB modules&quot;). These definitions are
not strictly required for the SNMP protocol to operate
correctly, but are typically needed by SNMP client
applications to display information in a meaningful
manner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The MIB file
also serves as a design document when developing an SNMP
agent (or sub-agent) that provides this information, and
ensures that client and server share a common understanding
about what management information represents.</p>

<h2>OIDs
<a name="OIDs"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MIB objects are
specified using Object Identifiers (OIDs), which can take a
number of forms. Note that all of the examples in this
section refer to the same MIB object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Numeric
OIDs</b> <br>
The fundamental format of an OID is a sequence of integer
values (or &quot;subidentifiers&quot;), typically written
using dots to separate the individual subidentifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This is the format that is used
within the SNMP protocol itself, in the packets that are
sent over the network.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This form of
representing an OID does not require MIB files or MIB object
definitions to be available. However it does rely on the
client application and/or network administrator knowing what
a given numeric OID refers to. As such, it is not a
particularly helpful representation to anyone just starting
out with SNMP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This format can
be obtained by giving the command-line option -On to most
Net-SNMP commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Full OID
path</b> <br>
A similar (but somewhat more informative) format uses the
same dotted list representation, but with the numeric
subidentifiers replaced by names, taken from the relevant
MIB file(s).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;">.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This uniquely identifies a
particular MIB object (as with the numeric OID), but the
list of names should hopefully give some indication as to
what information this object represents. However it does
rely on the relevant MIB files being available (as do all
formats other than the purely numeric OID). Such OIDs also
tend to be fairly long!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This format can
be obtained by giving the command-line option -Of to most
Net-SNMP commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A variant of
this (typically used when writing OIDs in descriptive text,
rather than running programs), is to combine the name and
numeric subidentifier:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;">.iso(1).org(3).dod(6).internet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1).sysDescr(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Module-qualified
OIDs</b> <br>
An alternative way to (more-or-less) uniquely specify an
OID, is to give the name of the MIB object, together with
the MIB module where it is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MIB object names are unique
within a given module, so as long as there are not two MIB
modules with the same name (which is unusual, though not
unheard of), this format specifies the desired object in a
reasonably compact form. It also makes it relatively easy to
find the definition of the MIB object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
default format for displaying OIDs in Net-SNMP applications.
It can also be specified explicitly by giving the
command-line option -OS to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Object
name</b> <br>
Possibly the most common form for specifying MIB objects is
using the name of the object alone - without the full path
or the name of the module that defines it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sysDescr</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This is by far the shortest and
most convenient way to refer to a MIB object. However the
danger is that if two MIB modules each define a MIB object
with the same name (which is perfectly legal in some
circumstances), then it&rsquo;s not necessarily clear which
MIB object is actually meant. For day-to-day use,
particularly when using standard MIB objects, this is
<i>probaby</i> safe. But it&rsquo;s important to be aware of
the potential ambiguities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This format can
be obtained by giving the command-line option -Os to most
Net-SNMP commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UCD-format</b>
<br>
Previous versions of the code (UCD v4.x and earlier) used a
simple approach to shortening the way OIDs were specified.
If the full path of the OID began with
<tt>.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2</tt> then this prefix
was removed from the OID before displaying it. All other
OIDs were displayed in full.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, if
an OID was passed to the UCD library that did not begin with
a dot (and wasn&rsquo;t in the module::name format), then
the same prefix was prepended. The example OID from the
formats listed above would therefore be given or displayed
as</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">system.sysDescr</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The inconsistent handling of
OIDs, depending on their location within the OID tree,
proved to be more trouble than it was worth, and this format
is no longer recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The previous
behaviour can be obtained by giving the command-line option
-Ou (for displaying output), or -Iu (for interpreting input
OIDs without a leading dot) to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
