<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REINDEX { INDEX
| TABLE | DATABASE | SYSTEM } <i>name</i> [ FORCE ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>REINDEX</b>
rebuilds an index using the data stored in the index's
table, replacing the old copy of the index. There are
several scenarios in which to use <b>REINDEX</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; An index
has become corrupted, and no longer contains valid data.
Although in theory this should never happen, in practice
indexes can become corrupted due to software bugs or
hardware failures. <b>REINDEX</b> provides a recovery
method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; An index
has become &ldquo;bloated&rdquo;, that is it contains many
empty or nearly&minus;empty pages. This can occur with
B&minus;tree indexes in PostgreSQL under certain uncommon
access patterns. <b>REINDEX</b> provides a way to reduce the
space consumption of the index by writing a new version of
the index without the dead pages. See Section 23.2,
&ldquo;Routine Reindexing&rdquo;, in the documentation for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; You have
altered a storage parameter (such as fillfactor) for an
index, and wish to ensure that the change has taken full
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; An index
build with the CONCURRENTLY option failed, leaving an
&ldquo;invalid&rdquo; index. Such indexes are useless but it
can be convenient to use <b>REINDEX</b> to rebuild them.
Note that <b>REINDEX</b> will not perform a concurrent
build. To build the index without interfering with
production you should drop the index and reissue the
<b>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</b> command.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">INDEX</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recreate the specified
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TABLE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recreate all indexes of the
specified table. If the table has a secondary
&ldquo;TOAST&rdquo; table, that is reindexed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DATABASE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recreate all indexes within the
current database. Indexes on shared system catalogs are also
processed. This form of <b>REINDEX</b> cannot be executed
inside a transaction block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Recreate all indexes on system
catalogs within the current database. Indexes on shared
system catalogs are included. Indexes on user tables are not
processed. This form of <b>REINDEX</b> cannot be executed
inside a transaction block.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the specific index,
table, or database to be reindexed. Index and table names
can be schema&minus;qualified. Presently, <b>REINDEX
DATABASE</b> and <b>REINDEX SYSTEM</b> can only reindex the
current database, so their parameter must match the current
database's name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FORCE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an obsolete option; it
is ignored if specified.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you suspect
corruption of an index on a user table, you can simply
rebuild that index, or all indexes on the table, using
<b>REINDEX INDEX</b> or <b>REINDEX TABLE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Things are more
difficult if you need to recover from corruption of an index
on a system table. In this case it's important for the
system to not have used any of the suspect indexes itself.
(Indeed, in this sort of scenario you might find that server
processes are crashing immediately at start&minus;up, due to
reliance on the corrupted indexes.) To recover safely, the
server must be started with the <b>&minus;P</b> option,
which prevents it from using indexes for system catalog
lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One way to do
this is to shut down the server and start a
single&minus;user PostgreSQL server with the <b>&minus;P</b>
option included on its command line. Then, <b>REINDEX
DATABASE</b>, <b>REINDEX SYSTEM</b>, <b>REINDEX TABLE</b>,
or <b>REINDEX INDEX</b> can be issued, depending on how much
you want to reconstruct. If in doubt, use <b>REINDEX
SYSTEM</b> to select reconstruction of all system indexes in
the database. Then quit the single&minus;user server session
and restart the regular server. See the <b>postgres</b>(1)
reference page for more information about how to interact
with the single&minus;user server interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
a regular server session can be started with <b>&minus;P</b>
included in its command line options. The method for doing
this varies across clients, but in all libpq&minus;based
clients, it is possible to set the <b>PGOPTIONS</b>
environment variable to &minus;P before starting the client.
Note that while this method does not require locking out
other clients, it might still be wise to prevent other users
from connecting to the damaged database until repairs have
been completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>REINDEX</b>
is similar to a drop and recreate of the index in that the
index contents are rebuilt from scratch. However, the
locking considerations are rather different. <b>REINDEX</b>
locks out writes but not reads of the index's parent table.
It also takes an exclusive lock on the specific index being
processed, which will block reads that attempt to use that
index. In contrast, <b>DROP INDEX</b> momentarily takes an
exclusive lock on the parent table, blocking both writes and
reads. The subsequent <b>CREATE INDEX</b> locks out writes
but not reads; since the index is not there, no read will
attempt to use it, meaning that there will be no blocking
but reads might be forced into expensive sequential
scans.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reindexing a
single index or table requires being the owner of that index
or table. Reindexing a database requires being the owner of
the database (note that the owner can therefore rebuild
indexes of tables owned by other users). Of course,
superusers can always reindex anything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to
PostgreSQL 8.1, <b>REINDEX DATABASE</b> processed only
system indexes, not all indexes as one would expect from the
name. This has been changed to reduce the surprise factor.
The old behavior is available as <b>REINDEX SYSTEM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to
PostgreSQL 7.4, <b>REINDEX TABLE</b> did not automatically
process TOAST tables, and so those had to be reindexed by
separate commands. This is still possible, but
redundant.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rebuild a
single index:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">REINDEX INDEX
my_index;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rebuild all the
indexes on the table my_table:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">REINDEX TABLE
my_table;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rebuild all
indexes in a particular database, without trusting the
system indexes to be valid already:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ <b>export
PGOPTIONS=&quot;&minus;P&quot;</b> <br>
$ <b>psql broken_db</b> <br>
... <br>
broken_db=&gt; REINDEX DATABASE broken_db; <br>
broken_db=&gt; \q</p>
