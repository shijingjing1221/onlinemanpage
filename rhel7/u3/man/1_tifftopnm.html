convert a TIFF file into a PNM image</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tifftopnm</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tifftopnm</b>
reads a TIFF file as input and produces a PNM image as
output. The type of the output file depends on the input
file - if it&rsquo;s black and white, <b>tifftopnm</b>
generates a PBM image; if it&rsquo;s grayscale, it generates
a PGM image; otherwise, the output is PPM. The program tells
you which type it is writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the TIFF
file contains multiple images (multiple
&rsquo;directories&rsquo;), <b>tifftopnm</b> generates a
multi-image PNM output stream. Before Netpbm 10.27 (March
2005), however, it would just ignore all but the first input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>tiff-filename</i> argument names the regular file that
contains the Tiff image. If you specify &rsquo;-&rsquo; or
don&rsquo;t specify this argument, <b>tfftopnm</b> uses
Standard Input. In either case, the file must be seekable.
That means no pipe, but any regular file is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TIFF
Capability <br>
pamtotiff</b> uses the Libtiff.org TIFF library (or whatever
equivalent you provide) to interpret the TIFF input. So the
set of files it is able to interpret is determined mostly by
that library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
cannot read every possible TIFF file -- there are myriad
variations of the TIFF format. However, it does understand
monochrome and gray scale, RGB, RGBA (red/green/blue with
alpha channel), CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color
separation), and color palette TIFF files. An RGB file can
have either single plane (interleaved) color or multiple
plane format. The program reads 1-8 and 16 bit-per-sample
input, the latter in either bigendian or littlendian
encoding. Tiff directory information may also be either
bigendian or littlendian.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
TIFF formats that <b>tifftopnm</b> can read only if the
image is small enough to fit in memory. <b>tifftopnm</b>
uses the TIFF library&rsquo;s TIFFRGBAImageGet() function to
process the TIFF image if it can get enough memory for
TIFFRGBAImageGet() to store the whole image in memory at
once (that&rsquo;s what TIFFRGBAImageGet() does). If not,
<b>tifftopnm</b> uses a more primitive row-by-row conversion
strategy using the raw data returned by TIFFReadScanLine()
and native intelligence. That native intelligence does not
know as many formats as TIFFRGBAImageGet() does. And certain
compressed formats simply cannot be read with
TIFFReadScanLine().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.11 (October 2002), <b>tifftopnm</b> never used
TIFFRGBAImageGet(), so it could not interpret many of the
formats it can interpret today.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
fundamental reason that this program could not read other
kinds of TIFF files even when they don&rsquo;t fit in memory
all at once. The existing limitations are mainly because no
one has asked for more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Output
Image</b> <br>
The PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except
that if the Tiff input is colormapped (which implies a
maxval of 65535) the PNM output has a maxval of 255. Though
this may result in lost information, such input images
hardly ever actually have more color resolution than a
maxval of 255 provides and people often cannot deal with PNM
files that have maxval &gt; 255. By contrast, a
non-colormapped Tiff image that doesn&rsquo;t need a maxval
&gt; 255 doesn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> a maxval &gt; 255, so
when <b>tifftopnm</b> sees a non-colormapped maxval &gt;
255, it takes it seriously and produces a matching output
maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
exception is where the TIFF maxval is greater than 65535,
which is the maximum allowed by the Netpbm formats. In that
case, <b>tifftopnm</b> uses a maxval of 65535, and you lose
some information in the conversion.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may
abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix. You may
use two hyphens instead of one in options. You may separate
an option and its value either by an equals sign or white
space. <b><br>
-alphaout=</b><i>alpha-filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>tifftopnm</b> creates a PGM
file containing the alpha channel values in the input image.
If the input image doesn&rsquo;t contain an alpha channel,
the <i>alpha-filename</i> file contains all zero
(transparent) alpha values. If you don&rsquo;t specify
<b>-alphaout</b>,</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tifftopnm</b>
does not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has
an alpha channel, <b>tifftopnm</b> simply discards it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
<b>-</b> as the filename, <b>tifftopnm</b> writes the alpha
output to Standard Output and discards the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>pamcomp</b>(1) <br>
for one way to use the alpha output file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-respectfillorder</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, <b>tifftopnm</b>
ignores the &rsquo;fillorder&rsquo; tag in the TIFF input,
which means it may incorrectly interpret the image. To make
it follow the spec, use this option. For a lengthy but
engaging discussion of why <b>tifftopnm</b> works this way
and how to use the <b>-respectfillorder</b> option, see the
note on fillorder below.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tifftopnm</b>
has two ways to do the conversion from Tiff to PNM, using
respectively two facilities of the TIFF library:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Whole Image</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Decode the entire image into
memory at once, using <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b>, then
convert to PNM and output row by row.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Row By Row</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read, convert, and output one
row at a time using <b>TIFFReadScanline()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Whole Image is
preferable because the Tiff library does more of the work,
which means it understands more of the Tiff format
possibilities now and in the future. Also, some compressed
TIFF formats don&rsquo;t allow you to extract an individual
row.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Row By Row uses
far less memory, which means with large images, it can run
in environments where Whole Image cannot and may also run
faster. And because Netpbm code does more of the work,
it&rsquo;s possible that it can be more flexible or at least
give better diagnostic information if there&rsquo;s
something wrong with the TIFF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The Netpbm
native code may do something correctly that the TIFF library
does incorrectly, or vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm, we
stress function over performance, so by default we try Whole
Image first, and if we can&rsquo;t get enough memory for the
decoded image or <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> fails, we fall
back to Row By Row. But if you specify the <b>-byrow</b>
option, <b>tifftopnm</b> will not attempt Whole Image. If
Row By Row does not work, it simply fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">See
<a href="#cmyk">Color Separation (CMYK) TIFFs</a> for a
description of one way Row By Row makes a significant
difference in your results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Whole Image
costs you precision when your TIFF image uses more than 8
bits per sample. <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> converts the
samples to 8 bits. <b>tifftopnm</b> then scales them back to
maxval 65535, but the lower 8 bits of information is
gone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In many
versions of the TIFF library, <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> does
not correctly interpret TIFF files in which the raster
orientation is column-major (i.e. a row of the raster is a
column of the image). With such a TIFF library and file, you
must use <b>-byrow</b> to get correct output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.11 (October 2002), <b>tifftopnm</b> always did Row By
Row. Netpbm 10.12 always tried Whole Image first.
<b>-byrow</b> came in with Netpbm 10.13 (January 2003).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-orientraw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A TIFF stream contains raster
data which can be arranged in the stream various ways. Most
commonly, it is arranged by rows, with the top row first,
and the pixels left to right within each row, but many other
orientations are possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The common
orientation is the same on the Netpbm formats use, so
<b>tifftopnm</b> can do its jobs quite efficiently when the
TIFF raster is oriented that way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">But if the TIFF
raster is oriented any other way, it can take a considerable
amount of processing for <b>tifftopnm</b> to convert it to
Netpbm format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-orientraw</b>
says to produce an output image that represents the raw
raster in the TIFF stream rather than the image the TIFF
stream is supposed to represent. In the output, the top left
corner corresponds to the start of the TIFF raster, the next
pixel to the right is the next pixel in the TIFF raster,
etc. <b>tifftopnm</b> can do this easily, but you
don&rsquo;t get the right image out. You can use
<b>pamflip</b> to turn the output into the image the TIFF
stream represents (but if you do that, you pretty much lose
the benefit of <b>-orientraw</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With this
option, <b>tifftopnm</b> always uses the Row By Row method
(see <b>-byrow</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.42 (March 2008). Before that,
<b>tifftopnm</b> generally produces arbitrary results with
TIFF images that have an orientation other than the common
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print extra messages to
Standard Error about the conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-headerdump</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dump TIFF file information to
stderr. This information may be useful in debugging TIFF
file conversion problems.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Fillorder</b>
<br>
There is a piece of information in the header of a TIFF
image called &rsquo;fillorder.&rsquo; The TIFF specification
quite clearly states that this value tells the order in
which bits are arranged in a byte in the description of the
image&rsquo;s pixels. There are two options, assuming that
the image has a format where more than one pixel can be
represented by a single byte: 1) the byte is filled from
most significant bit to least significant bit going left to
right in the image; and 2) the opposite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, there
is confusion in the world as to the meaning of fillorder.
Evidence shows that some people believe it has to do with
byte order when a single value is represented by two
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These people
cause TIFF images to be created that, while they use a
MSB-to-LSB fillorder, have a fillorder tag that says they
used LSB-to-MSB. A program that properly interprets a TIFF
image will not end up with the image that the author
intended in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a long
time, <b>tifftopnm</b> did not understand fillorder itself
and assumed the fillorder was MSB-to-LSB regardless of the
fillorder tag in the TIFF header. And as far as I know,
there is no legitimate reason to use a fillorder other than
MSB-to-LSB. So users of <b>tifftopnm</b> were happily using
those TIFF images that had incorrect fillorder tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So that those
users can continue to be happy, <b>tifftopnm</b> today
continues to ignore the fillorder tag unless you tell it not
to. (It does, however, warn you when the fillorder tag does
not say MSB-to-LSB that the tag is being ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If for some
reason you have a TIFF image that actually has LSB-to-MSB
fillorder, and its fillorder tag correctly indicates that,
you must use the <b>-respectfillorder</b> option on
<b>tifftopnm</b> to get proper results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples of
incorrect TIFF images are at
<a href="ftp://weather.noaa.gov.">ftp://weather.noaa.gov.</a>
They are apparently created by a program called
<b>faxtotiff</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This note was
written on January 1, 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Color
Separation (CMYK) TIFFs</b> <br>
Some TIFF images contain color information in CMYK form,
whereas PNM images use RGB. There are various formulas for
converting between these two forms, and <b>tifftopnm</b> can
use either of two.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TIFF
library (Version 3.5.4 from libtiff.org) uses Y=(1-K)*(1-B)
(similar for R and G) in its TIFFRGBAImageGet() service.
When <b>tifftopnm</b> works in Whole Image mode, it uses
that service, so that&rsquo;s the conversion you get.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But when
<b>tifftopnm</b> runs in Row By Row mode, it does not use
TIFFRGBAImageGet(), and you get what appears to be more
useful: Y=1-(B+K). This is the inverse of what
<b>pnmtotiffcmyk</b> does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
<b>-byrow</b> option for more information on Whole Image
versus Row By Row mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.21 (March 2004), <b>tifftopnm</b> used the Y=(1-K)*(1-B)
formula always.</p>
