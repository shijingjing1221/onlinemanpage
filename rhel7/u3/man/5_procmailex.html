<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The weighted
scoring technique is described in detail in the
<b>procmailsc</b>(5) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
shows several example recipes. For examples of complete
rcfiles you can check the NOTES section in
<b>procmail</b>(1), or look at the example rcfiles part of
the procmail source distribution
(procmail*/examples/?procmailrc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
fairly new to procmail and plan to experiment a little bit
it often helps to have a <i>safety net</i> of some sort.
Inserting the following two recipes above all other recipes
will make sure that of all arriving mail always the last 32
messages will be preserved. In order for it to work as
intended, you have to create a directory named
&lsquo;backup&rsquo; in $MAILDIR prior to inserting these
two recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 c <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your system
doesn&rsquo;t generate or generates incorrect leading
&lsquo;From &rsquo; lines on every mail, you can fix this by
calling up procmail with the &minus;f- option. To fix the
same problem by different means, you could have inserted the
following two recipes above all other recipes in your
rcfile. They will filter the header of any mail through
formail which will strip any leading &lsquo;From &rsquo;,
and automatically regenerates it subsequently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 fhw <br>
| formail &minus;I &quot;From &quot; &minus;a &quot;From
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Add the headers
of all messages that didn&rsquo;t come from the postmaster
to your private header collection (for statistics or mail
debugging); and use the lockfile &lsquo;headc.lock&rsquo;.
In order to make sure the lockfile is not removed until the
pipe has finished, you have to specify option
&lsquo;w&rsquo;; otherwise the lockfile would be removed as
soon as the pipe has accepted the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 hwc: <br>
* !^FROM_MAILER <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or, if you
would use the more efficient gzip instead of compress:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 hwc: <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Forward all

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Split up

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A simple
autoreply recipe. It makes sure that neither mail from any
daemon (like bouncing mail or mail from mailing-lists), nor
autoreplies coming from yourself will be autoreplied to. If
this precaution would not be taken, disaster could result
(&lsquo;ringing&rsquo; mail). In order for this recipe to
autoreply to all the incoming mail, you should of course
insert it before all other recipes in your rcfile. However,
it is advisable to put it <i>after</i> any recipes that
process the mails from subscribed mailinglists; it generally
is not a good idea to generate autoreplies to mailinglists
(yes, the !^FROM_DAEMON regexp should already catch those,
but if the mailinglist doesn&rsquo;t follow accepted
conventions, this might <i>not</i> be <i>enough</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A more
complicated autoreply recipe that implements the functional
equivalent of the well known <b>vacation</b>(1) program.
This recipe is based on the same principles as the last one
(prevent &lsquo;ringing&rsquo; mail). In addition to that
however, it maintains a vacation database by extracting the
name of the sender and inserting it in the vacation.cache
file if the name was new (the vacation.cache file is
maintained by formail which will make sure that it always
contains the most recent names, the size of the file is
limited to a maximum of approximately 8192 bytes). If the
name was new, an autoreply will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
the following recipe has comments <b>between</b> the
conditions. This is allowed. Do <b>not</b> put comments on
the same line as a condition though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Store all
messages concerning TeX in separate, unique filenames, in a
directory named texmail (this directory has to exist); there
is no need to use lockfiles in this case, so we
won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same as

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you could
file the mail in several directory folders at the same time.
The following recipe will deliver the mail to two MH-folders
and one directory folder. It is actually only one file with
two extra hardlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Store all the
messages about meetings in a folder that is in a directory
that changes every month. E.g. if it were January 1994, the
folder would have the name &lsquo;94-01/meeting&rsquo; and
the locallockfile would be
&lsquo;94-01/meeting.lock&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0: <br>
* meeting <br>
&lsquo;date +%y-%m&lsquo;/meeting</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same as
above, but, if the &lsquo;94-01&rsquo; directory
wouldn&rsquo;t have existed, it is created
automatically:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MONTHFOLDER=&lsquo;date

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 Wic <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same as

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
subscribed to several mailinglists and people cross-post to
some of them, you usually receive several duplicate mails
(one from every list). The following simple recipe
eliminates duplicate mails. It tells formail to keep an 8KB
cache file in which it will store the Message-IDs of the
most recent mails you received. Since Message-IDs are
guaranteed to be unique for every new mail, they are ideally
suited to weed out duplicate mails. Simply put the following
recipe at the top of your rcfile, and no duplicate mail will
get past it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 Wh:
msgid.lock <br>
| formail &minus;D 8192 msgid.cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Beware</b>
if you have delivery problems in recipes below this one and
procmail tries to requeue the mail, then on the next queue
run, this mail will be considered a duplicate and will be
thrown away. For those not quite so confident in their own
scripting capabilities, you can use the following recipe
instead. It puts duplicates in a separate folder instead of
throwing them away. It is up to you to periodically empty
the folder of course.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 Whc:

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Procmail can
deliver to MH folders directly, but, it does not update the
unseen sequences the real MH manages. If you want procmail
to update those as well, use a recipe like the following
which will file everything that contains the word spam in
the body of the mail into an MH folder called spamfold. Note
the local lockfile, which is needed because MH programs do
not lock the sequences file. Asynchronous invocations of MH
programs that change the sequences file may therefore
corrupt it or silently lose changes. Unfortunately, the
lockfile doesn&rsquo;t completely solve the problem as
rcvstore could be invoked while &lsquo;show&rsquo; or
&lsquo;mark&rsquo; or some other MH program is running. This
problem is expected to be fixed in some future version of
MH, but until then, you&rsquo;ll have to balance the risk of
lost or corrupt sequences against the benefits of the unseen
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0
:spamfold/$LOCKEXT <br>
* B ?? spam <br>
| rcvstore +spamfold</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When delivering
to emacs folders (i.e., mailfolders managed by any emacs
mail package, e.g., RMAIL or VM) directly, you should use
emacs-compatible lockfiles. The emacs mailers are a bit
braindamaged in that respect, they get very upset if someone
delivers to mailfolders which they already have in their
internal buffers. The following recipe assumes that $HOME
equals /home/john.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR=Mail</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0:/usr/local/lib/emacs/lock/!home!john!Mail!mailbox
<br>
* ^Subject:.*whatever <br>
mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can have procmail deliver into its own set of mailboxes,
which you then periodically empty and copy over to your
emacs files using <b>movemail</b>. Movemail uses
mailbox.lock local lockfiles per mailbox. This actually is
the preferred mode of operation in conjunction with
procmail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To extract
certain headers from a mail and put them into environment
variables you can use any of the following constructs:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">SUBJECT=&lsquo;formail
&minus;xSubject:&lsquo; # regular field <br>
FROM=&lsquo;formail &minus;rt &minus;xTo:&lsquo; # special
case</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 h #
alternate method <br>
KEYWORDS=| formail &minus;xKeywords:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using temporary files in a procmailrc file, and want to make
sure that they are removed just before procmail exits, you
could use something along the lines of:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">TEMPORARY=$HOME/tmp/pmail.$$
<br>
TRAP=&quot;/bin/rm &minus;f $TEMPORARY&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TRAP
keyword can also be used to change the exitcode of procmail.
I.e. if you want procmail to return an exitcode of
&lsquo;1&rsquo; instead of its regular exitcodes, you could
use:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">EXITCODE=&quot;&quot;
<br>
TRAP=&quot;exit 1;&quot; # The trailing semi-colon is
important <br>
# since exit is not a standalone program</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or, if the
exitcode does not need to depend on the programs run from
the TRAP, you can use a mere:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">EXITCODE=1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
recipe prints every incoming mail that looks like a
postscript file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 Bb <br>
* ^^%! <br>
| lpr</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
recipe does the same, but is a bit more selective. It only
prints the postscript file if it comes from the
print-server. The first condition matches only if it is
found in the header. The second condition only matches at
the start of the body.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 b <br>
* ^From[ :].*print-server <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
have two accounts, you use both accounts regularly, but they
are in very distinct places (i.e., you can only read mail
that arrived at either one of the accounts). You would like
to forward mail arriving at account one to account two, and
the other way around. The first thing that comes to mind is
using .forward files at both sites; this won&rsquo;t work of
course, since you will be creating a mail loop. This mail
loop can be avoided by inserting the following recipe in
front of all other recipes in the $HOME/.procmailrc files on
both sites. If you make sure that you add the same X-Loop:
field at both sites, mail can now safely be forwarded to the
other account from either of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 c <br>

$SENDMAIL &minus;oi yourname@the.other.account</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If someone
sends you a mail with the word &lsquo;retrieve&rsquo; in the
subject, the following will automatically send back the
contents of info_file to the sender. Like in all recipes
where we send mail, we watch out for mail loops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now follows an
example for a very simple fileserver accessible by mail. For
more demanding applications, I suggest you take a look at
<b>SmartList</b> (available from the same place as the
procmail distribution). As listed, this fileserver sends
back at most one file per request, it ignores the body of
incoming mails, the Subject: line has to look like
&quot;Subject: send file the_file_you_want&quot; (the blanks
are significant), it does not return files that have names
starting with a dot, nor does it allow files to be retrieved
that are outside the fileserver directory tree (if you
decide to munge this example, make sure you do not
inadvertently loosen this last restriction).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">:0 <br>
* ^Subject: send file [0-9a-z] <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example preconverts all plain-text mail arriving in certain
encoded MIME formats into a more compact 8-bit format which
can be used and displayed more easily by most programs. The
<b>mimencode</b>(1) program is part of Nathaniel
Borenstein&rsquo;s metamail package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
one is rather exotic, but it only serves to demonstrate a
feature. Suppose you have a file in your HOME directory
called &quot;.urgent&quot;, and the (one) person named in
that file is the sender of an incoming mail, you&rsquo;d
like that mail to be stored in $MAILDIR/urgent instead of in
any of the normal mailfolders it would have been sorted in.
Then this is what you could do (beware, the filelength of
$HOME/.urgent should be well below $LINEBUF, increase
LINEBUF if necessary):</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">URGMATCH=&lsquo;cat

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An entirely
different application for procmail would be to conditionally
apply filters to a certain (outgoing) text or mail. A
typical example would be a filter through which you pipe all
outgoing mail, in order to make sure that it will be MIME
encoded only if it needs to be. I.e. in this case you could
start procmail in the middle of a pipe like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">cat newtext |
procmail ./mimeconvert | mail chris@where.ever</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
