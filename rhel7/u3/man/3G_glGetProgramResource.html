<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>glGetProgramResourceiv</b>
returns values for multiple properties of a single active
resource with an index of <i>index</i> in the interface
<i>programInterface</i> of program object <i>program</i>.
For each resource, values for <i>propCount</i> properties
specified by the array <i>props</i> are returned.
<i>propCount</i> may not be zero. An error is generated if
any value in <i>props</i> is not one of the properties
described immediately belowor if any value in <i>props</i>
is not allowed for <i>programInterface</i>. The set of
allowed <i>programInterface</i> values for each property can
be found in the following table:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
property <b>GL_NAME_LENGTH</b>, a single integer identifying
the length of the name string associated with an active
variable, interface block, or subroutine is written to
<i>params</i>. The name length includes a terminating null
character. For the property <b>GL_TYPE</b>, a single integer
identifying the type of an active variable is written to
<i>params</i>. The integer returned is one of the values
found in table 2.16. For the property <b>GL_ARRAY_SIZE</b>,
a single integer identifying the number of active array
elements of an active variable is written to <i>params</i>.
The array size returned is in units of the type associated
with the property TYPE. For active variables not
corresponding to an array of basic types, the value zero is
written to <i>params</i>. For the property
<b>GL_BLOCK_INDEX</b>, a single integer identifying the
index of the active interface block containing an active
variable is written to <i>params</i>. If the variable is not
the member of an interface block, the value &minus;1 is
written to <i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_OFFSET</b>,
a single integer identifying the offset of an active
variable is written to <i>params</i>. For active variables
backed by a buffer object, the value written is the offset,
in basic machine units, relative to the base of buffer range
holding the values of the variable. For active variables not
backed by a buffer object, an offset of &minus;1 is written
to <i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_ARRAY_STRIDE</b>, a
single integer identifying the stride between array elements
in an active variable is written to <i>params</i>. For
active variables declared as an array of basic types, the
value written is the difference, in basic machine units,
between the offsets of consecutive elements in an array. For
active variables not declared as an array of basic types,
zero is written to <i>params</i>. For active variables not
backed by a buffer object, &minus;1 is written to
<i>params</i>, regardless of the variable type. For the
property <b>GL_MATRIX_STRIDE</b>, a single integer
identifying the stride between columns of a
column&minus;major matrix or rows of a row&minus;major
matrix is written to <i>params</i>. For active variables
declared a single matrix or array of matrices, the value
written is the difference, in basic machine units, between
the offsets of consecutive columns or rows in each matrix.
For active variables not declared as a matrix or array of
matrices, zero is written to <i>params</i>. For active
variables not backed by a buffer object, &minus;1 is written
to <i>params</i>, regardless of the variable type. For the
property <b>GL_IS_ROW_MAJOR</b>, a single integer
identifying whether an active variable is a row&minus;major
matrix is written to <i>params</i>. For active variables
backed by a buffer object, declared as a single matrix or
array of matrices, and stored in row&minus;major order, one
is written to <i>params</i>. For all other active variables,
zero is written to <i>params</i>. For the property
<b>GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER_INDEX</b>, a single integer
identifying the index of the active atomic counter buffer
containing an active variable is written to <i>params</i>.
If the variable is not an atomic counter uniform, the value
&minus;1 is written to <i>params</i>. For the property
<b>GL_BUFFER_BINDING</b>, to index of the buffer binding
point associated with the active uniform block, shader
storage block, or atomic counter buffer is written to
<i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_BUFFER_DATA_SIZE</b>,
then the implementation&minus;dependent minimum total buffer
object size, in basic machine units, required to hold all
active variables associated with an active uniform block,
shader storage block, or atomic counter buffer is written to
<i>params</i>. If the final member of an active shader
storage block is array with no declared size, the minimum
buffer size is computed assuming the array was declared as
an array with one element. For the property
<b>GL_NUM_ACTIVE_VARIABLES</b>, the number of active
variables associated with an active uniform block, shader
storage block, or atomic counter buffer is written to
<i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_of
ACTIVE_VARIABLES</b>, an array of active variable indices
associated with an active uniform block, shader storage
block, or atomic counter buffer is written to <i>params</i>.
The number of values written to <i>params</i> for an active
resource is given by the value of the property
<b>GL_NUM_ACTIVE_VARIABLES</b> for the resource. For the
properties <b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_VERTEX_SHADER</b>,
<b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER</b>,
<b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER</b>,
<b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_GEOMETRY_SHADER</b>,
<b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_FRAGMENT_SHADER</b>, and
<b>GL_REFERENCED_BY_COMPUTE_SHADER</b>, a single integer is
written to <i>params</i>, identifying whether the active
resource is referenced by the vertex, tessellation control,
tessellation evaluation, geometry, or fragment shaders,
respectively, in the program object. The value one is
written to <i>params</i> if an active variable is referenced
by the corresponding shader, or if an active uniform block,
shader storage block, or atomic counter buffer contains at
least one variable referenced by the corresponding shader.
Otherwise, the value zero is written to <i>params</i>. For
the property <b>GL_TOP_LEVEL_ARRAY_SIZE</b>, a single
integer identifying the number of active array elements of
the top&minus;level shader storage block member containing
to the active variable is written to <i>params</i>. If the
top&minus;level block member is not declared as an array,
the value one is written to <i>params</i>. If the
top&minus;level block member is an array with no declared
size, the value zero is written to <i>params</i>. For the
property <b>GL_TOP_LEVEL_ARRAY_STRIDE</b>, a single integer
identifying the stride between array elements of the
top&minus;level shader storage block member containing the
active variable is written to <i>params</i>. For
top&minus;level block members declared as arrays, the value
written is the difference, in basic machine units, between
the offsets of the active variable for consecutive elements
in the top&minus;level array. For top&minus;level block
members not declared as an array, zero is written to
<i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_LOCATION</b>, a single
integer identifying the assigned location for an active
uniform, input, output, or subroutine uniform variable is
written to <i>params</i>. For input, output, or uniform
variables with locations specified by a layout qualifier,
the specified location is used. For vertex shader input or
fragment shader output variables without a layout qualifier,
the location assigned when a program is linked is written to
<i>params</i>. For all other input and output variables, the
value &minus;1 is written to <i>params</i>. For uniforms in
uniform blocks, the value &minus;1 is written to
<i>params</i>. For the property <b>GL_LOCATION_INDEX</b>, a
single integer identifying the fragment color index of an
active fragment shader output variable is written to
<i>params</i>. If the active variable is an output for a
non&minus;fragment shader, the value &minus;1 will be
written to <i>params</i>. For the property
<b>GL_IS_PER_PATCH</b>, a single integer identifying whether
the input or output is a per&minus;patch attribute. If the
active variable is a per&minus;patch attribute (declared
with the patch qualifier), the value one is written to
<i>params</i>; otherwise, the value zero is written to
<i>params</i>.</p>
