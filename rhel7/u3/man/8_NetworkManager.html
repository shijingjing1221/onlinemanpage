<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking
configuration and operation as painless and automatic as
possible by managing the primary network connection and
other network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile
Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any network
device when a connection for that device becomes available,
unless that behavior is disabled. Information about
networking is exported via a D&minus;Bus interface to any
interested application, providing a rich API with which to
inspect and control network settings and operation.</p>

<h2>DISPATCHER SCRIPTS
<a name="DISPATCHER SCRIPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager
will execute scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d
directory or subdirectories in alphabetical order in
response to network events. Each script should be a regular
executable file owned by root. Furthermore, it must not be
writable by group or other, and not setuid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each script
receives two arguments, the first being the interface name
of the device an operation just happened on, and second the
action. For device actions, the interface is the name of the
kernel interface suitable for IP configuration. Thus it is
either VPN_IP_IFACE, DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as
applicable. For the <i>hostname</i> and
<i>connectivity&minus;change</i> actions it is always
&quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The actions
are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pre&minus;up</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The interface is connected to
the network but is not yet fully activated. Scripts acting
on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre&minus;up.d directory,
and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to
complete before indicating to applications that the
interface is fully activated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>up</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The interface has been
activated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pre&minus;down</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The interface will be
deactivated but has not yet been disconnected from the
network. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre&minus;down.d directory,
and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to
complete before disconnecting the interface from its
network. Note that this event is not emitted for forced
disconnections, like when carrier is lost or a wireless
signal fades. It is only emitted when there is an
opportunity to cleanly handle a network disconnection
event.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>down</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The interface has been
deactivated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>vpn&minus;pre&minus;up</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The VPN is connected to the
network but is not yet fully activated. Scripts acting on
this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre&minus;up.d directory,
and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to
complete before indicating to applications that the VPN is
fully activated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>vpn&minus;up</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A VPN connection has been
activated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>vpn&minus;pre&minus;down</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The VPN will be deactivated but
has not yet been disconnected from the network. Scripts
acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre&minus;down.d directory,
and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to
complete before disconnecting the VPN from its network. Note
that this event is not emitted for forced disconnections,
like when the VPN terminates unexpectedly or general
connectivity is lost. It is only emitted when there is an
opportunity to cleanly handle a VPN disconnection event.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>vpn&minus;down</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A VPN connection has been
deactivated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>hostname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The system hostname has been
updated. Use gethostname(2) to retrieve it. The interface
name (first argument) is empty and no environment variable
is set for this action.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>dhcp4&minus;change</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The DHCPv4 lease has changed
(renewed, rebound, etc).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>dhcp6&minus;change</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The DHCPv6 lease has changed
(renewed, rebound, etc).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>connectivity&minus;change</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The network connectivity state
has changed (no connectivity, went online, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
contains more information about the interface and the
connection. The following variables are available for the
use in the dispatcher scripts:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTION_UUID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The UUID of the connection
profile.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTION_ID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (ID) of the connection
profile.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTION_DBUS_PATH</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The NetworkManager D&minus;Bus
path of the connection.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTION_FILENAME</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The backing file name of the
connection profile (if any).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTION_EXTERNAL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If &quot;1&quot;, this
indicates that the connection describes a network
configuration created outside of NetworkManager.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DEVICE_IFACE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The interface name of the
control interface of the device. Depending on the device
type, this differs from <i>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</i>. For example
for ADSL devices, this could be 'atm0' or for WWAN devices
it might be 'ttyUSB0'.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DEVICE_IP_IFACE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The IP interface name of the
device. This is the network interface on which IP addresses
and routes will be configured.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_ADDRESS_N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The IPv4 address in the format
&quot;address/prefix gateway&quot;, where N is a number from
0 to (# IPv4 addresses &minus; 1). gateway item in this
variable is deprecated, use IP4_GATEWAY instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variable contains the
number of IPv4 addresses the script may expect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_GATEWAY</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The gateway IPv4 address in
traditional numbers&minus;and&minus;dots notation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_ROUTE_N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The IPv4 route in the format
&quot;address/prefix next&minus;hop metric&quot;, where N is
a number from 0 to (# IPv4 routes &minus; 1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_NUM_ROUTES</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variable contains the
number of IPv4 routes the script may expect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_NAMESERVERS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variable contains a
space&minus;separated list of the DNS servers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP4_DOMAINS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variable contains a
space&minus;separated list of the search domains.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DHCP4_&lt;dhcp&minus;option&minus;name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the connection used DHCP for
address configuration, the received DHCP configuration is
passed in the environment using standard DHCP option names,
prefixed with &quot;DHCP4_&quot;, like
&quot;DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>IP6_&lt;name&gt;
and DHCP6_&lt;name&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The same variables as for IPv4
are available for IPv6, but the prefixes are IP6_ and DHCP6_
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONNECTIVITY_STATE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The network connectivity state,
which can take the values defined by the NMConnectivityState
type, from the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager D&minus;Bus
API: unknown, none, portal, limited or full. Note: this
variable will only be set for connectivity&minus;change
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case of VPN,
VPN_IP_IFACE is set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with VPN
prefix are exported too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0,
VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dispatcher
scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the
main NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run
for too long. If your script might take arbitrarily long to
complete, you should spawn a child process and have the
parent return immediately. Scripts that are symbolic links
pointing inside the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no&minus;wait.d/ directory
are run immediately, without waiting for the termination of
previous scripts, and in parallel. Also beware that once a
script is queued, it will always be run, even if a later
event renders it obsolete. (Eg, if an interface goes up, and
then back down again quickly, it is possible that one or
more &quot;up&quot; scripts will be run after the interface
has gone down.)</p>

syslog.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;pid&minus;file</b>
| <b>&minus;p</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify location of a PID file.
The PID file is used for storing PID of the running process
and prevents running multiple instances.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;state&minus;file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify file for storing state
of the NetworkManager persistently. If not specified, the
default value of
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify configuration file to
set up various settings for NetworkManager. If not
specified, the default value of
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a
fallback to the older 'nm&minus;system&minus;settings.conf'
if located in the same directory. See
<b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more information on
configuration file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;plugins</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List plugins used to manage
system&minus;wide connection settings. This list has
preference over plugins specified in the configuration file.
Currently supported plugins are: keyfile,
<b>ifcfg&minus;rh</b>, <b>ifcfg&minus;suse</b>,
<b>ifupdown</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets how much information
NetworkManager sends to the log destination (usually
syslog's &quot;daemon&quot; facility). By default, only
informational, warning, and error messages are logged. See
the section on logging in <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for
more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;domains</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A comma&minus;separated list
specifying which operations are logged to the log
destination (usually syslog). By default, most domains are
logging&minus;enabled. See the section on logging in

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;print&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the NetworkManager
configuration to stdout and exit.</p>

<h2>UDEV PROPERTIES
<a name="UDEV PROPERTIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>udev</b>(7)
device manager is used for the network device discovery. The
following property influences how NetworkManager manages the
devices:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>NM_UNMANAGED</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No default connection will be
created and automatic activation will not be attempted when
this property of a device is set to a true value
(&quot;1&quot; or &quot;true&quot;). You will still be able
to attach a connection to the device manually or observe
externally added configuration such as addresses or
routes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Create an udev
rule that sets this property to prevent NetworkManager from
interfering with virtual Ethernet device interfaces that are
managed by virtualization tools.</p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager
process handles the following signals:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGHUP</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal causes a reload of
NetworkManager's configuration. Note that not all
configuration parameters can be changed at runtime and
therefore some changes may be applied only after the next
restart of the daemon. A SIGHUP also involves further
reloading actions, like doing a DNS update and restarting
the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful for example when
using the dnsmasq plugin and changing its configuration in
/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it also means this
will shortly interrupt name resolution. In the future, there
may be further actions added. A SIGHUP means to update
NetworkManager configuration and reload everything that is
supported. Note that this does not reload connections from
disk. For that there is a D&minus;Bus API and nmcli's reload
action</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGUSR1</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal forces a rewrite of
DNS configuration. Contrary to SIGHUP, this does not restart
the DNS plugin and will not interrupt name resolution. In
the future, further actions may be added. A SIGUSR1 means to
write out data like resolv.conf, or refresh a cache. It is a
subset of what is done for SIGHUP without reloading
configuration from disk.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGUSR2</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal has no effect at the
moment but is reserved for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload
D&minus;Bus call. It allows for more fine&minus;grained
selection of what to reload, it only returns after the
reload is complete, and it is guarded by PolicyKit.</p>

<h2>DEBUGGING
<a name="DEBUGGING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment variables are supported to help debugging. When
used in conjunction with the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;daemon</b> option (thus echoing
PPP and DHCP helper output to stdout) these can quickly help
pinpoint the source of connection issues. Also see the
<b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;level</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;domains</b> to enable debug
logging inside NetworkManager itself.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NM_PPP_DEBUG</b>:
When set to anything, causes NetworkManager to turn on PPP
debugging in pppd, which logs all PPP and PPTP frames and
client/server exchanges.</p>
