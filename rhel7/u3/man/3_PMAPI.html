<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within the
framework of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), client
applications are developed using the Performance Metrics
Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) that defines a
procedural interface with services suited to the development
of applications with a particular interest in performance
metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
description presents an overview of the PMAPI and the
context in which PMAPI applications are run. The PMAPI is
more fully described in the <i>Performance Co-Pilot
Programmer&rsquo;s Guide</i>, and the manual pages for the
individual PMAPI routines.</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE METRICS &minus; NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS
<a name="PERFORMANCE METRICS &minus; NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a
description of the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) and
associated terms and concepts, see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all PMIDs
need be represented in the PMNS of every application. For
example, an application which monitors disk traffic will
likely use a name space which references only the PMIDs for
I/O statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
which use the PMAPI may have independent versions of a PMNS,
constructed from an initialization file when the application
starts; see <b>pmLoadASCIINameSpace</b>(3),
<b>pmLoadNameSpace</b>(3), and <b>pmns</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Internally
(below the PMAPI) the implementation of the Performance
Metrics Collection System (PMCS) uses only the PMIDs, and a
PMNS provides an external mapping from a hierarchic taxonomy
of names to PMIDs that is convenient in the context of a
particular system or particular use of the PMAPI. For the
applications programmer, the routines <b>pmLookupName</b>(3)
and <b>pmNameID</b>(3) translate between names in a PMNS and
PMIDs, and vice versa. The PMNS may be traversed using
<b>pmGetChildren</b>(3) and<b>pmTraversePMNS</b>. The
<b>pmFetchGroup</b>(3) functions combine metric name lookup,
fetch, and conversion operations.</p>

<h2>PMAPI CONTEXT
<a name="PMAPI CONTEXT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An application
using the PMAPI may manipulate several concurrent contexts,
each associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g.
<b>pmcd</b>(1) on some host, or a set of archive logs of
performance metrics as created by <b>pmlogger</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Contexts are
identified by a &lsquo;&lsquo;handle&rsquo;&rsquo;, a small
integer value that is returned when the context is created;
see <b>pmNewContext</b>(3) and <b>pmDupContext</b>(3). Some
PMAPI functions require an explicit
&lsquo;&lsquo;handle&rsquo;&rsquo; to identify the correct
context, but more commonly the PMAPI function is executed in
the &lsquo;&lsquo;current&rsquo;&rsquo; context. The current
context may be discovered using <b>pmWhichContext</b>(3) and
changed using <b>pmUseContext</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a PMAPI
context has not been explicitly established (or the previous
current context has been closed using
<b>pmDestroyContext</b>(3)) then the current PMAPI context
is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the source of the performance metrics, the context also
includes the instance profile and collection time (both
described below) which controls how much information is
returned, and when the information was collected.</p>

<h2>INSTANCE DOMAINS
<a name="INSTANCE DOMAINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
performance metric values are returned across the PMAPI to a
requesting application, there may be more than one value for
a particular metric. Multiple values, or <b>instances</b>,
for a single metric are typically the result of
instrumentation being implemented for each instance of a set
of similar components or services in a system, e.g.
independent counts for each CPU, or each process, or each
disk, or each system call type, etc. This multiplicity of
values is not enumerated in the name space but rather, when
performance metrics are delivered across the PMAPI by
<b>pmFetch</b>(3), the format of the result accommodates
values for one or more instances, with an instance-value
pair encoding the metric value for a particular
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The instances
are identified by an internal identifier assigned by the
agent responsible for instantiating the values for the
associated performance metric. Each instance identifier has
a corresponding external instance identifier name (an ASCII
string). The routines <b>pmGetInDom</b>(3),
<b>pmLookupInDom</b>(3) and <b>pmNameInDom</b>(3) may be
used to enumerate all instance identifiers, and to translate
between internal and external instance identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
instance identifiers for a particular performance metric are
collectively known as an instance domain. Multiple
performance metrics may share the same instance domain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If only one
instance is ever available for a particular performance
metric, the instance identifier in the result from
<b>pmFetch</b>(3) assumes the special value
<b>PM_IN_NULL</b> and may be ignored by the application, and
only one instance-value pair appears in the result for that
metric. Under these circumstances, the associated instance
domain (as returned via <b>pmLookupDesc</b>(3)) is set to
<b>PM_INDOM_NULL</b> to indicate that values for this metric
are singular.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The difficult
issue of transient performance metrics (e.g. per-filesystem
information, hot-plug replaceable hardware modules, etc.)
means that repeated requests for the same PMID may return
different numbers of values, and/or some changes in the
particular instance identifiers returned. This means
applications need to be aware that metric instantiation is
guaranteed to be valid at the time of collection only.
Similar rules apply to the transient semantics of the
associated metric values. In general however, it is expected
that the bulk of the performance metrics will have
instantiation semantics that are fixed over the execution
life-time of any PMAPI client.</p>

<h2>THE TYPE OF METRIC VALUES
<a name="THE TYPE OF METRIC VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PMAPI
supports a wide range of format and type encodings for the
values of performance metrics, namely signed and unsigned
integers, floating point numbers, 32-bit and 64-bit
encodings of all of the above, ASCII strings (C-style, NULL
byte terminated), and arbitrary aggregates of binary
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>type</i>
field in the <i>pmDesc</i> structure returned by
<b>pmLookupDesc</b>(3) identifies the format and type of the
values for a particular performance metric within a
particular PMAPI context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
encoding of values for a particular performance metric may
be different for different PMAPI contexts, due to
differences in the underlying implementation for different
contexts. However it is expected that the vast majority of
performance metrics will have consistent value encoding
across all versions of all implementations, and hence across
all PMAPI contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PMAPI
supports routines to automate the handling of the various
value formats and types, particularly for the common case
where conversion to a canonical format is desired, see
<b>pmExtractValue</b>(3) and <b>pmPrintValue</b>(3).</p>

<h2>THE DIMENSIONALITY AND SCALE OF METRIC VALUES
<a name="THE DIMENSIONALITY AND SCALE OF METRIC VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Independent of
how the value is encoded, the value for a performance metric
is assumed to be drawn from a set of values that can be
described in terms of their dimensionality and scale by a
compact encoding as follows. The dimensionality is defined
by a power, or index, in each of 3 orthogonal dimensions,
namely Space, Time and Count (or Events, which are
dimensionless). For example I/O throughput might be
represented as Space/Time, while the running total of system
calls is Count, memory allocation is Space and average
service time is Time/Count. In each dimension there are a
number of common scale values that may be used to better
encode ranges that might otherwise exhaust the precision of
a 32-bit value. This information is encoded in the
<i>pmUnits</i> structure which is embedded in the
<i>pmDesc</i> structure returned from
<b>pmLookupDesc</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routine
<b>pmConvScale</b>(3) is provided to convert values in
conjunction with the <i>pmUnits</i> structures that defines
the dimensionality and scale of the values for a particular
performance metric as returned from <b>pmFetch</b>(3), and
the desired dimensionality and scale of the value the PMAPI
client wishes to manipulate. Alternatively, the
<b>pmFetchGroup</b>(3) functions can perform data format and
unit conversion operations, specified by textual
descriptions of desired unit / scales.</p>

<h2>INSTANCE PROFILE
<a name="INSTANCE PROFILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
instances for performance metrics returned from a
<b>pmFetch</b>(3) call may be filtered or restricted using
an instance profile. There is one instance profile for each
PMAPI context the application creates, and each instance
profile may include instances from one or more instance
domains.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
<b>pmAddProfile</b>(3) and <b>pmDelProfile</b>(3) may be
used to dynamically adjust the instance profile.</p>

<h2>COLLECTION TIME
<a name="COLLECTION TIME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each set of
values for performance metrics returned via
<b>pmFetch</b>(3) there is an associated
&lsquo;&lsquo;timestamp&rsquo;&rsquo; that serves to
identify when the performance metric values were collected;
for metrics being delivered from a real-time source (i.e.
<b>pmcd</b>(1) on some host) this would typically be not
long before they were exported across the PMAPI, and for
metrics being delivered from a set of archive logs, this
would be the time when the metrics were written into the
archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is an
issue here of exactly when individual metrics may have been
collected, especially given their origin in potentially
different Performance Metric Domains, and variability in the
metric updating frequency at the lowest level of the
Performance Metric Domain. The PMCS opts for the pragmatic
approach, in which the PMAPI implementation undertakes to
return all of the metrics with values accurate as of the
timestamp, to the best of our ability. The belief is that
the inaccuracy this introduces is small, and the additional
burden of accurate individual timestamping for each returned
metric value is neither warranted nor practical (from an
implementation viewpoint).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course, in
the case of collection of metrics from multiple hosts the
PMAPI client must assume the sanity of the timestamps is
constrained by the extent to which clock synchronization
protocols are implemented across the network.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PMAPI
application may call <b>pmSetMode</b>(3) to vary the
requested collection time, e.g. to rescan performance
metrics values from the recent past, or to
&lsquo;&lsquo;fast-forward&rsquo;&rsquo; through a set of
archive logs.</p>

<h2>GENERAL ISSUES OF PMAPI PROGRAMMING STYLE
<a name="GENERAL ISSUES OF PMAPI PROGRAMMING STYLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Across the
PMAPI, all arguments and results involving a
&lsquo;&lsquo;list of something&rsquo;&rsquo; are declared
to be arrays with an associated argument or function value
to identify the number of elements in the list. This has
been done to avoid both the <b>varargs</b>(3) approach and
sentinel-terminated lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where the size
of a result is known at the time of a call, it is the
caller&rsquo;s responsibility to allocate (and possibly
free) the storage, and the called function will assume the
result argument is of an appropriate size. Where a result is
of variable size and that size cannot be known in advance
(e.g. for <b>pmGetChildren</b>(3), <b>pmGetInDom</b>(3),
<b>pmNameInDom</b>(3), <b>pmNameID</b>(3),
<b>pmLookupText</b>(3) and <b>pmFetch</b>(3)) the PMAPI
implementation uses a range of dynamic allocation schemes in
the called routine, with the caller responsible for
subsequently releasing the storage when no longer required.
In some cases this simply involves calls to <b>free</b>(3),
but in others (most notably for the result from
<b>pmFetch</b>(3)), special routines (e.g.
<b>pmFreeResult</b>(3)) should be used to release the
storage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
rule, if the called routine returns an error status then no
allocation will have been done, and any pointer to a
variable sized result is undefined.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where error
conditions may arise, the functions that comprise the PMAPI
conform to a single, simple error notification scheme, as
follows;</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>+</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>the function returns an integer</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>+</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>values &gt;= 0 indicate no error, and perhaps some
positive status, e.g. the number of things really
processed</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>+</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>values &lt; 0 indicate an error, with a global table of
error conditions and error messages</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PMAPI
routine <b>pmErrStr</b>(3) translates error conditions into
error messages. By convention, the small negative values are
assumed to be negated versions of the Unix error codes as
defined in <b>&lt;errno.h&gt;</b> and the strings returned
are as per <b>strerror</b>(3). The larger, negative error
codes are PMAPI error conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One error,
common to all PMAPI routines that interact with
<b>pmcd</b>(1) on some host is <b>PM_ERR_IPC</b>, which
indicates the communication link to <b>pmcd</b>(1) has been
lost.</p>

<h2>MULTI-THREADED APPLICATIONS
<a name="MULTI-THREADED APPLICATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
design for PCP was based around single-threaded
applications, or more strictly applications in which only
one thread was ever expected to call the PCP libraries. This
restriction has been relaxed for <b>libpcp</b> to allow the
most common PMAPI routines to be safely called from any
thread in a multi-threaded application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However the
following groups of functions and services in <b>libpcp</b>
are still restricted to being called from a single-thread,
and this is enforced by returning <b>PM_ERR_THREAD</b> when
an attempt to call the routines in each group from more than
one thread is detected.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT
<a name="PCP ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
environment variables are described in <b>PCPIntro</b>(1).
In addition, environment variables with the prefix
<b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory
names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
<i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these
variables. The <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to
specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
<b>pcp.conf</b>(5). Values for these variables may be
obtained programmatically using the <b>pmGetConfig</b>(3)
function.</p>
