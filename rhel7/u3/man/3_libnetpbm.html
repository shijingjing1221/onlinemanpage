general introduction to the netpbm library</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>libnetpbm</b>
is a C programming library for reading, writing, and
manipulating Netpbm images. It also contains a few general
graphics manipulation tools, but it is not intended to be a
graphics tools library. For graphics tools, Netpbm expects
you to run the Netpbm programs. From a C program, the
<b>libnetpbm</b> function <b>pm_system()</b> makes this
easy. However, since it creates a process and execs a
program, this may be too heavyweight for some
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use
<b>libnetpbm</b> services in your C program, #include the
<b>pam.h</b> interface header file. For historical reasons,
you can also get by in some cases with <b>pbm.h</b>,
<b>pgm.h</b>, <b>ppm.h</b>, or <b>pnm.h</b>, but
there&rsquo;s really no point to that anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>libnetpbm</b> functions are divided into these
categories:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For new
programming, you rarely need to concern yourself with the
PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM functions, because the newer PAM
functions do the same thing and are easier to use. For
certain processing of bi-level images, the PBM functions are
significantly more efficient, though.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>libnetpbm</b>
has a backward compatibility feature that means a function
designed to read one format can read some others too,
converting on the fly. In particular, a function that reads
a PGM image will also read a PBM image, but converts it as
it reads it so that for programming purposes, it is a PGM
image. Similarly, a function that reads PPM can read PBM and
PGM as well. And a function that reads PBM, PGM, or PPM can
read a PAM that has an equivalent tuple type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each of the
five classes of <b>libnetpbm</b> image processing functions,
<b>libnetpbm</b> has in in-memory representation for a
pixel, a row, and a whole image. Do not confuse this format
with the actual image format, as you would see in a file.
The <b>libnetpbm</b> in-memory format is designed to make
programming very easy. It is sometimes extremely
inefficient, even more than the actual image format. For
example, a pixel that a PPM image represents with 3 bytes,
<b>libnetpbm</b>&rsquo;s PAM functions represent with 16
bytes. A pixel in a PBM image is represented by a single
bit, but the PNM functions represent that pixel in memory
with 96 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>Libnetpbm</b>User&rsquo;s<b>Manual</b>(1) <br>
for the basics on using <b>libnetpbm</b> in a program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can look up
the reference information for a particular function in
<b>The</b>libnetpbm<b>Directory</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
release 10 (June 2002), this library was split into four:
libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm. That&rsquo;s largely the
reason for the multiple sets of functions and scattered
documentation.</p>
