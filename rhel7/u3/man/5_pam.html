<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pam - Netpbm
common 2-dimensional bitmap format</p>

<h2>GENERAL
<a name="GENERAL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PAM image
format is a lowest common denominator 2 dimensional map
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is designed
to be used for any of myriad kinds of graphics, but can
theoretically be used for any kind of data that is arranged
as a two dimensional rectangular array. Actually, from
another perspective it can be seen as a format for data
arranged as a three dimensional array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name
&rsquo;PAM&rsquo; is an acronym derived from &rsquo;Portable
Arbitrary Map.&rsquo; This derivation makes more sense if
you consider it in the context of the other Netpbm format
names: PBM, PGM, and PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This format
does not define the meaning of the data at any particular
point in the array. It could be red, green, and blue light
intensities such that the array represents a visual image,
or it could be the same red, green, and blue components plus
a transparency component, or it could contain annual
rainfalls for places on the surface of the Earth. Any
process that uses the PAM format must further define the
format to specify the meanings of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PAM image
describes a two dimensional grid of tuples. The tuples are
arranged in rows and columns. The width of the image is the
number of columns. The height of the image is the number of
rows. All rows are the same width and all columns are the
same height. The tuples may have any degree, but all tuples
have the same degree. The degree of the tuples is called the
depth of the image. Each member of a tuple is called a
sample. A sample is an unsigned integer which represents a
locus along a scale which starts at zero and ends at a
certain maximum value called the maxval. The maxval is the
same for every sample in the image. The two dimensional
array of all the Nth samples of each tuple is called the Nth
plane or Nth channel of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Though the
basic format does not assign any meaning to the tuple
values, it does include an optional string that describes
that meaning. The contents of this string, called the tuple
type, are arbitrary from the point of view of the basic PAM
format, but users of the format may assign meaning to it by
convention so they can identify their particular
implementations of the PAM format. Some tuple types are
defined as official subformats of PAM. See
<a href="#tupletype">Defined Tuple Types</a> .</p>

<h2>The Confusing Universe of Netpbm Formats
<a name="The Confusing Universe of Netpbm Formats"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is easy to
get confused about the relationship between the PAM format
and PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM. Here is a little
enlightenment:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;PNM&quot;
is not really a format. It is a shorthand for the PBM, PGM,
and PPM formats collectively. It is also the name of a group
of library functions that can each handle all three of those
formats.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;PAM&rsquo;
is in fact a fourth format. But it is so general that you
can represent the same information in a PAM image as you can
in a PBM, PGM, or PPM image. And in fact a program that is
designed to read PBM, PGM, or PPM and does so with a recent
version of the Netpbm library, will read an equivalent PAM
image just fine and the program will never know the
difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To confuse
things more, there is a collection of library routines
called the &rsquo;pam&rsquo; functions that read and write
the PAM format, but also read and write the PBM, PGM, and
PPM formats. They do this because the latter formats are
much older and more popular, so even a new program must work
with them. Having the library handle all the formats makes
it convenient to write programs that use the newer PAM
format as well.</p>

<h2>THE LAYOUT
<a name="THE LAYOUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A convenient
way to read and write the PAM format accurately is via the
<b>libnetpbm</b>(1) <br>
C subroutine library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PAM file
consists of a sequence of one or more PAM images. There are
no data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between
images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each PAM image
consists of a header followed immediately by a raster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example header:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P7
WIDTH 227
HEIGHT 149
DEPTH 3
MAXVAL 255
TUPLTYPE RGB
ENDHDR</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header
begins with the ASCII characters &rsquo;P7&rsquo; followed
by newline. This is the magic number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: <b>xv</b>
thumbnail images also start with the &quot;P7&quot; magic
number. (This and PAM were independent extensions to the
Netpbm formats). The rest of the format makes it easy to
distinguish PAM from that format, though).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header
continues with an arbitrary number of lines of ASCII text.
Each line ends with and is delimited by a newline
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each header
line consists of zero or more whitespace-delimited tokens or
begins with &rsquo;#&rsquo;. If it begins with
&rsquo;#&rsquo; it is a comment and the rest of this
specification does not apply to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A header line
which has zero tokens is valid but has no meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type of
header line is identified by its first token, which is 8
characters or less:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>ENDHDR</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the last line in the header. The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>HEIGHT</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
height of the image (number of rows). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>WIDTH</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
width of the image (number of columns). The header must
contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>DEPTH</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
depth of the image (number of planes or channels). The
header must contain exactly one of these header lines.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>MAXVAL</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The second token is a decimal number representing the
maxval of the image. The header must contain exactly one of
these header lines.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TUPLTYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The header may contain any
number of these header lines, including zero. The rest of
the line is part of the tuple type. The rest of the line is
not tokenized, but the tuple type does not include any white
space immediately following <b>TUPLTYPE</b> or at the very
end of the line. It does not include a newline. There must
be something other than white space after the
<b>TUPLTYPE</b> token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
multiple <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines, the tuple type is the
concatenation of the values from each of them, separated by
a single blank, in the order in which they appear in the
header. If there are no <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines the
tuple type is the null string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The raster
consists of each row of the image, in order from top to
bottom, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between,
before, or after, rows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each row
consists of every tuple in the row, in order from left to
right, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between,
before, or after, tuples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each tuple
consists of every sample in the tuple, in order, consecutive
with no delimiter of any kind between, before, or after,
samples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each sample
consists of an unsigned integer in pure binary format, with
the most significant byte first. The number of bytes is the
minimum number of bytes required to represent the maxval of
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The character
referred to as &rsquo;newline&rsquo; herein is the character
known in ASCII as Line Feed or LF.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Height, width,
depth, and maxval are at least 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Height, width,
and depth have no defined maximum, but processors and
generators of images usually have their own limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The maxval of
an image is never greater than 65535. (The reason it is
limited is to make it easier to build an image processor, in
which intermediate arithmetic values often have to fit
within 31 or 32 bits). There was no specified limitation
before October, 2005, but essentially all implementations
have always observed it.</p>

<h2>DEFINED TUPLE TYPES
<a name="DEFINED TUPLE TYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some tuple
types are defined in this specification to specify official
subformats of PAM for especially popular applications of the
format. Users of the format may also define their own tuple
types, and thus their own subformats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PAM Used For
Visual Images</b> <br>
A common use of PAM images is to represent visual images
such as are typically represented by images in the older and
more concrete PBM, PGM, and PPM formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Black And
White (PBM)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A black and
white image, such as would be represented by a PBM image,
has a tuple type of &quot;BLACKANDWHITE&quot;. Such a PAM
image has a depth of 1 and maxval 1 where the one sample in
each tuple is 0 to represent a black pixel and 1 to
represent a white one. The height, width, and raster bear
the obvious relationship to those of the equivalent PBM
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
the PBM format, a zero value means white, but in PAM, zero
means black.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Grayscale
(PGM)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A grayscale
image, such as would be represented by a PGM image, has a
tuple type of &quot;GRAYSCALE&quot;. Such a PAM image has a
depth of 1. The maxval, height, width, and raster bear the
obvious relationship to those of the equivalent PGM
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Color
(PPM)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A color image,
such as would be represented by a PPM image, has a typle
type of &quot;RGB&quot;. Such a PAM image has a depth of 3.
The maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious
relationship to those of the PPM image. The first plane
represents red, the second green, and the third blue.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Transparent</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
visual image formats mentioned above has a variation that
contains transparency information. In that variation, the
tuple type has &rsquo;_ALPHA&rsquo; added to it (e.g.
&rsquo;RGB_ALPHA&rsquo;) and one more plane. The highest
numbered plane is the opacity plane (sometimes called an
alpha plane or transparency plane).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this kind of
image, the color represented by a pixel is actually a
combination of an explicitly specified foreground color and
a background color to be identified later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The planes
other than the opacity plane describe the foreground color.
A sample in the opacity plane tells how opaque the pixel is,
by telling what fraction of the pixel&rsquo;s light comes
from the foreground color. The rest of the pixel&rsquo;s
light comes from the (unspecified) background color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, in
a GRAYSCALE_ALPHA image, assume Plane 0 indicates a gray
tone 60% of white and Plane 1 indicates opacity 25%. The
foreground color is the 60% gray, and 25% of that
contributes to the ultimate color of the pixel. The other
75% comes from some background color. So let&rsquo;s assume
further that the background color of the pixel is full
white. Then the color of the pixel is 90% of white: 25% of
the foreground 60%, plus 75% of the background 100%.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sample
value is the opacity fraction just described, as a fraction
of the maxval. Note that it is <i>not</i> gamma-adjusted
like the foreground color samples.</p>
