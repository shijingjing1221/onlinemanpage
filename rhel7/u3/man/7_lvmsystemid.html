&mdash; LVM system ID</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Local VGs may
exist on shared storage where they are visible to multiple
hosts. These VGs are intended to be used by only a single
machine, even though they are visible to many. A system_id
identifying a single host can be assigned to a VG to
indicate the VGs owner. The VG owner can use the VG as
usual, and all other hosts will ignore it. This protects the
VG from accidental use by other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system_id
is not a dynamic property, and can only be changed in very
limited circumstances (see vgexport and vgimport). Even
limited changes to the VG system_id are not perfectly
reflected across hosts. A more coherent view of shared
storage requires using an inter-host locking system to
coordinate access and update caches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system_id
is a string uniquely identifying a host. It can be manually
set to a custom value or it can be assigned automatically by
lvm using a unique identifier already available on the host,
e.g. machine-id or uname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In vgcreate,
the local system_id is saved in the new VG metadata. The
local host owns the new VG, and other hosts cannot use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A VG without a
system_id can be used by any host, and a VG with a system_id
can only be used by a host with a matching system_id. A
<b>foreign VG</b> is a VG with a system_id as viewed by a
host with a system_id that does not match the VGs system_id.
(Or from a host without a system_id.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Valid system_id
characters are the same as valid VG name characters. If a
system_id contains invalid characters, those characters are
omitted and remaining characters are used. If a system_id is
longer than the maximum name length, the characters up to
the maximum length are used. The maximum length of a
system_id is 128 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limitations
and warnings</b> <br>
To benefit fully from system_id, all hosts must have
system_id set, and VGs must have system_id set. A VG on
shared storage can be damaged or destroyed in some cases
which the user must be careful to avoid.</p>

<p>A VG without a system_id can be used without restriction
from any host, even from hosts that have a system_id. Many
VGs will not have a system_id and are unprotected. Verify
that a VG has a system_id by running the command &rsquo;vgs
-o+systemid&rsquo;</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A VG will not
have a system_id if it was created before this feature was
added to lvm, or if it was created by a host that did not
have a system_id defined. A system_id can be assigned to
these VGs by using vgchange --systemid (see below).</p>

<p>Orphan PVs (or unused devices) on shared storage are
completely unprotected by the system_id feature. Commands
that use these PVs, such as vgcreate or vgextend, are not
prevented from performing conflicting operations and
corrupting the PVs. See the <b>orphans</b> section for more
information.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="86%">


<p>A host using an old version of lvm without the system_id
feature will not recognize a new system_id in VGs from other
hosts. Even though the old version of lvm is not blocked
from reading a VG with a system_id, it is blocked from
writing to the VG (or its LVs). The new system_id changes
the write mode of a VG, making it appear read-only to
previous lvm versions.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This also means
that if a host downgrades its version of lvm, it would lose
access to any VGs it had created with a system_id. To avoid
this, the system_id should be removed from VGs before
downgrading to an lvm version without the system_id
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Types of VG
access</b> <br>
A local VG is meant to be used by a single host. <br>
A shared or clustered VG is meant to be used by multiple
hosts. <br>
These can be further distinguished as:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unrestricted:</b>
A local VG that has no system_id. This VG type is
unprotected and accessible to any host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Owned:</b> A
local VG that has a system_id set, as viewed from the one
host with a matching system_id (the owner). This VG type is
by definition acessible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Foreign:</b>
A local VG that has a system_id set, as viewed from any host
with an unmatching system_id (or no system_id). It is owned
by another host. This VG type is by definition not
accessible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exported:</b>
A local VG that has been exported with vgexport and has no
system_id. This VG type can only be accessed by vgimport
which will change it to owned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shared:</b>
A shared or &quot;lockd&quot; VG has lock_type set and no
system_id. A shared VG is meant to be used on shared storage
from multiple hosts, and is only accessible to hosts using
lvmlockd. Applicable only if LVM is compiled with lockd
support.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Clustered:</b>
A clustered or &quot;clvm&quot; VG has the clustered flag
set and no system_id. A clustered VG is meant to be used on
shared storage from multiple hosts, and is only accessible
to hosts using clvmd.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>system_id_source</b>
<br>
A host&rsquo;s own system_id can be defined in a number of
ways. lvm.conf global/system_id_source defines the method
lvm will use to find the local system_id:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>none</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvm will not use a system_id.
lvm is allowed to access VGs without a system_id, and will
create new VGs without a system_id. An undefined
system_id_source is equivalent to none.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The content of
/etc/machine-id is used as the system_id if available. See
<b>machine-id</b>(5) and <b>systemd-machine-id-setup</b>(1)

}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changing
system_id_source will often cause the system_id to change,
which may prevent the host from using VGs that it previously
used (see extra_system_ids below to handle this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
system_id_source other than none fails to resolve a
system_id, the host will be allowed to access VGs with no
system_id, but will not be allowed to access VGs with a
defined system_id.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>extra_system_ids</b>
<br>
In some cases, it may be useful for a host to access VGs
with different system_id&rsquo;s, e.g. if a host&rsquo;s
system_id changes, and it wants to use VGs that it created
with its old system_id. To allow a host to access VGs with
other system_id&rsquo;s, those other system_id&rsquo;s can
be listed in lvmlocal.conf local/extra_system_ids.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>lvmlocal.conf</i>
<br>
local { <br>
extra_system_ids = [ &quot;my_other_name&quot; ] <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgcreate</b>
<br>
In vgcreate, the host running the command assigns its own
system_id to the new VG. To override this and set another
system_id:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgcreate
--systemid</b> <i>SystemID VG Devices</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Overriding the
system_id makes it possible for a host to create a VG that
it may not be able to use. Another host with a system_id
matching the one specified may not recognize the new VG
without manually rescanning devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
--systemid argument is an empty string (&quot;&quot;), the
VG is created with no system_id, making it accessible to
other hosts (see warnings above.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>report/display</b>
<br>
The system_id of a VG is displayed with the
&quot;systemid&quot; reporting option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Report/display
commands ignore foreign VGs by default. To report foreign
VGs, the --foreign option can be used. This causes the VGs
to be read from disk. Because lvmetad caching is not used,
this option can cause poor performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgs
--foreign -o+systemid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a host
with no system_id sees foreign VGs, it warns about them as
they are skipped. The host should be assigned a system_id,
after which standard reporting commands will silently ignore
foreign VGs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgexport/vgimport</b>
<br>
vgexport clears the system_id.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other hosts
will continue to see a newly exported VG as foreign because
of local caching (when lvmetad is used). Manually updating
the local lvmetad cache with pvscan --cache will allow a
host to recognize the newly exported VG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">vgimport sets
the VG system_id to the local system_id as determined by
lvm.conf system_id_source. vgimport automatically scans
storage for newly exported VGs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After vgimport,
the exporting host will continue to see the VG as exported,
and not owned by the new host. Manually updating the local
cache with pvscan --cache will allow a host to recognize the
newly imported VG as foreign.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgchange</b>
<br>
A host can change the system_id of its own VGs, but the
command requires confirmation because the host may lose
access to the VG being changed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgchange
--systemid</b> <i>SystemID VG</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system_id
can be removed from a VG by specifying an empty string
(&quot;&quot;) as the new system_id. This makes the VG
accessible to other hosts (see warnings above.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A host cannot
directly change the system_id of a foreign VG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To move a VG
from one host to another, vgexport and vgimport should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To forcibly
gain ownership of a foreign VG, a host can add the foreign
system_id to its extra_system_ids list, change the system_id
of the foreign VG to its own, and remove the foreign
system_id from its extra_system_ids list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>shared
VGs</b> <br>
A shared/lockd VG has no system_id set, allowing multiple
hosts to use it via lvmlockd. Changing a VG to a lockd type
will clear the existing system_id. Applicable only if LVM is
compiled with lockd support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>clustered
VGs</b> <br>
A clustered/clvm VG has no system_id set, allowing multiple
hosts to use it via clvmd. Changing a VG to clustered will
clear the existing system_id. Changing a VG to not clustered
will set the system_id to the host running the vgchange
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>creation_host</b>
<br>
In vgcreate, the VG metadata field creation_host is set by
default to the host&rsquo;s uname. The creation_host cannot
be changed, and is not used to control access. When
system_id_source is &quot;uname&quot;, the system_id and
creation_host will be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>orphans</b>
<br>
Orphan PVs are unused devices; they are not currently used
in any VG. Because of this, they are not protected by a
system_id, and any host can use them. Coordination of
changes to orphan PVs is beyond the scope of system_id. The
same is true of any block device that is not a PV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effects of
this are especially evident when lvm uses lvmetad caching.
For example, if multiple hosts see an orphan PV, and one
host creates a VG using the orphan, the other hosts will
continue to report the PV as an orphan. Nothing would
automatically prevent the other hosts from using the newly
allocated PV and corrupting it. If the other hosts run a
command to rescan devices, and update lvmetad, they would
then recognize that the PV has been used by another host. A
command that rescans devices could be pvscan --cache, or vgs
--foreign.</p>
