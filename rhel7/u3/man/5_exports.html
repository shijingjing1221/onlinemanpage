<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">exports &minus;
NFS server export table</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
<i>/etc/exports</i> contains a table of local physical file
systems on an NFS server that are accessible to NFS clients.
The contents of the file are maintained by the
server&rsquo;s system administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each file
system in this table has a list of options and an access
control list. The table is used by <b>exportfs</b>(8) to
give information to <b>mountd</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file format
is similar to the SunOS <i>exports</i> file. Each line
contains an export point and a whitespace-separated list of
clients allowed to mount the file system at that point. Each
listed client may be immediately followed by a
parenthesized, comma-separated list of export options for
that client. No whitespace is permitted between a client and
its option list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, each line
may have one or more specifications for default options
after the path name, in the form of a dash
(&quot;&minus;&quot;) followed by an option list. The option
list is used for all subsequent exports on that line
only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Blank lines are
ignored. A pound sign (&quot;#&quot;) introduces a comment
to the end of the line. Entries may be continued across
newlines using a backslash. If an export name contains
spaces it should be quoted using double quotes. You can also
specify spaces or other unusual character in the export name
using a backslash followed by the character code as three
octal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To apply
changes to this file, run <b>exportfs &minus;ra</b> or
restart the NFS server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Machine Name
Formats</b> <br>
NFS clients may be specified in a number of ways: <br>
single host</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You may specify a host either
by an abbreviated name recognized be the resolver, the fully
qualified domain name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.
IPv6 addresses must not be inside square brackets in
/etc/exports lest they be confused with character-class
wildcard matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">IP networks</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You can also export directories
to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is
done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as
<i>address/netmask</i> where the netmask can be specified in
dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length. For
example, either &lsquo;/255.255.252.0&rsquo; or
&lsquo;/22&rsquo; appended to the network base IPv4 address
results in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host. IPv6
addresses must use a contiguous mask length and must not be
inside square brackets to avoid confusion with
character-class wildcards. Wildcard characters generally do
not work on IP addresses, though they may work by accident
when reverse DNS lookups fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">wildcards</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Machine names may contain the
wildcard characters <i>*</i> and <i>?</i>, or may contain
character class lists within [square brackets]. This can be
used to make the <i>exports</i> file more compact; for
instance, <i>*.cs.foo.edu</i> matches all hosts in the
domain <i>cs.foo.edu</i>. As these characters also match the
dots in a domain name, the given pattern will also match all
hosts within any subdomain of <i>cs.foo.edu</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">netgroups</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">NIS netgroups may be given as
<i>@group</i>. Only the host part of each netgroup members
is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or
those containing a single dash (&minus;) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">anonymous</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is specified by a single
<i>*</i> character (not to be confused with the
<i>wildcard</i> entry above) and will match all clients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a client
matches more than one of the specifications above, then the
first match from the above list order takes precedence -
regardless of the order they appear on the export line.
However, if a client matches more than one of the same type
of specification (e.g. two netgroups), then the first match
from the order they appear on the export line takes
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>RPCSEC_GSS
security</b> <br>
You may use the special strings &quot;gss/krb5&quot;,
&quot;gss/krb5i&quot;, or &quot;gss/krb5p&quot; to restrict
access to clients using rpcsec_gss security. However, this
syntax is deprecated; on linux kernels since 2.6.23, you
should instead use the &quot;sec=&quot; export option:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><i>sec=</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The sec= option, followed by a colon-delimited list of
security flavors, restricts the export to clients using
those flavors. Available security flavors include sys (the
default--no cryptographic security), krb5 (authentication
only), krb5i (integrity protection), and krb5p (privacy
protection). For the purposes of security flavor
negotiation, order counts: preferred flavors should be
listed first. The order of the sec= option with respect to
the other options does not matter, unless you want some
options to be enforced differently depending on flavor. In
that case you may include multiple sec= options, and
following options will be enforced only for access using
flavors listed in the immediately preceding sec= option. The
only options that are permitted to vary in this way are ro,
rw, no_root_squash, root_squash, and all_squash.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>General
Options <br>
exportfs</b> understands the following export options:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>secure</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option requires that
requests originate on an Internet port less than
IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). This option is on by default. To
turn it off, specify <i>insecure</i>.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>rw</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Allow both read and write requests on this NFS volume.
The default is to disallow any request which changes the
filesystem. This can also be made explicit by using the
<i>ro</i> option.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>async</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option allows the NFS server to violate the NFS
protocol and reply to requests before any changes made by
that request have been committed to stable storage (e.g.
disc drive).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
option usually improves performance, but at the cost that an
unclean server restart (i.e. a crash) can cause data to be
lost or corrupted.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>sync</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reply to requests only after the
changes have been committed to stable storage (see
<i>async</i> above).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In releases of
nfs-utils up to and including 1.0.0, the <i>async</i> option
was the default. In all releases after 1.0.0, <i>sync</i> is
the default, and <i>async</i> must be explicitly requested
if needed. To help make system administrators aware of this
change, <b>exportfs</b> will issue a warning if neither
<i>sync</i> nor <i>async</i> is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>no_wdelay</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option has no effect if
<i>async</i> is also set. The NFS server will normally delay
committing a write request to disc slightly if it suspects
that another related write request may be in progress or may
arrive soon. This allows multiple write requests to be
committed to disc with the one operation which can improve
performance. If an NFS server received mainly small
unrelated requests, this behaviour could actually reduce
performance, so <i>no_wdelay</i> is available to turn it
off. The default can be explicitly requested with the
<i>wdelay</i> option.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>nohide</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option is based on the option of the same name
provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two
filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the
client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get
access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an
empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is
mounted. That filesystem is &quot;hidden&quot;.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Setting the
<i>nohide</i> option on a filesystem causes it not to be
hidden, and an appropriately authorised client will be able
to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing
the change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">However, some
NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for
instance, it is then possible for two files in the one
apparent filesystem to have the same inode number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>nohide</i> option is currently only effective on
<i>single host</i> exports. It does not work reliably with
netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option can
be very useful in some situations, but it should be used
with due care, and only after confirming that the client
system copes with the situation effectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option can
be explicitly disabled for NFSv2 and NFSv3 with
<i>hide</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
not relevant when NFSv4 is use. NFSv4 never hides
subordinate filesystems. Any filesystem that is exported
will be visible where expected when using NFSv4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>crossmnt</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is similar to
<i>nohide</i> but it makes it possible for clients to access
all filesystems mounted on a filesystem marked with
<i>crossmnt</i>. Thus when a child filesystem &quot;B&quot;
is mounted on a parent &quot;A&quot;, setting crossmnt on
&quot;A&quot; has a similar effect to setting
&quot;nohide&quot; on B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With
<i>nohide</i> the child filesystem needs to be explicitly
exported. With <i>crossmnt</i> it need not. If a child of a
<i>crossmnt</i> file is not explicitly exported, then it
will be implicitly exported with the same export options as
the parent, except for <i>fsid=</i>. This makes it
impossible to <b>not</b> export a child of a <i>crossmnt</i>
filesystem. If some but not all subordinate filesystems of a
parent are to be exported, then they must be explicitly
exported and the parent should not have <i>crossmnt</i>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>nocrossmnt</i> option can explictly disable
<i>crossmnt</i> if it was previously set. This is rarely
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>no_subtree_check</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option disables subtree
checking, which has mild security implications, but can
improve reliability in some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a
subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole
filesystem isn&rsquo;t then whenever a NFS request arrives,
the server must check not only that the accessed file is in
the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it
is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is
called the <i>subtree_check</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
perform this check, the server must include some information
about the location of the file in the &quot;filehandle&quot;
that is given to the client. This can cause problems with
accessing files that are renamed while a client has them
open (though in many simple cases it will still work).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">subtree
checking is also used to make sure that files inside
directories to which only root has access can only be
accessed if the filesystem is exported with
<i>no_root_squash</i> (see below), even if the file itself
allows more general access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally
exported at the root and may see lots of file renames,
should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A
filesystem which is mostly readonly, and at least
doesn&rsquo;t see many file renames (e.g. /usr or /var) and
for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be
exported with subtree checks enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default of
having subtree checks enabled, can be explicitly requested
with <i>subtree_check</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">From release
1.1.0 of nfs-utils onwards, the default will be
<i>no_subtree_check</i> as subtree_checking tends to cause
more problems than it is worth. If you genuinely require
subtree checking, you should explicitly put that option in
the <b>exports</b> file. If you put neither option,
<b>exportfs</b> will warn you that the change is
pending.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>insecure_locks <br>
no_auth_nlm</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option (the two names are
synonymous) tells the NFS server not to require
authentication of locking requests (i.e. requests which use
the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a
lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read
access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Early NFS
client implementations did not send credentials with lock
requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are
based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find
that you can only lock files which are world readable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behaviour of requiring authentication for NLM requests can
be explicitly requested with either of the synonymous
<i>auth_nlm</i>, or <i>secure_locks</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>mountpoint=</i>path</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><i>mp</i></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option makes it possible to only export a directory
if it has successfully been mounted. If no path is given
(e.g. <i>mountpoint</i> or <i>mp</i>) then the export point
must also be a mount point. If it isn&rsquo;t then the
export point is not exported. This allows you to be sure
that the directory underneath a mountpoint will never be
exported by accident if, for example, the filesystem failed
to mount due to a disc error.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a path is
given (e.g. <i>mountpoint=</i>/path or <i>mp=</i>/path) then
the nominated path must be a mountpoint for the exportpoint
to be exported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>fsid=</i>num|root|uuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">NFS needs to be able to
identify each filesystem that it exports. Normally it will
use a UUID for the filesystem (if the filesystem has such a
thing) or the device number of the device holding the
filesystem (if the filesystem is stored on the device).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As not all
filesystems are stored on devices, and not all filesystems
have UUIDs, it is sometimes necessary to explicitly tell NFS
how to identify a filesystem. This is done with the
<i>fsid=</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For NFSv4,
there is a distinguished filesystem which is the root of all
exported filesystem. This is specified with <i>fsid=root</i>
or <i>fsid=0</i> both of which mean exactly the same
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Other
filesystems can be identified with a small integer, or a
UUID which should contain 32 hex digits and arbitrary
punctuation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Linux kernels
version 2.6.20 and earlier do not understand the UUID
setting so a small integer must be used if an fsid option
needs to be set for such kernels. Setting both a small
number and a UUID is supported so the same configuration can
be made to work on old and new kernels alike.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>nordirplus</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option will disable
READDIRPLUS request handling. When set, READDIRPLUS requests
from NFS clients return NFS3ERR_NOTSUPP, and clients fall
back on READDIR. This option affects only NFSv3 clients.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>refer=</i>path@host[+host][:path@host[+host]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A client referencing the export
point will be directed to choose from the given list an
alternative location for the filesystem. (Note that the
server must have a mountpoint here, though a different
filesystem is not required; so, for example, <i>mount
--bind</i> /path /path is sufficient.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>replicas=</i>path@host[+host][:path@host[+host]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the client asks for
alternative locations for the export point, it will be given
this list of alternatives. (Note that actual replication of
the filesystem must be handled elsewhere.)</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><i>pnfs</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option allows enables the use of pNFS extension if
protocol level is NFSv4.1 or higher, and the filesystem
supports pNFS exports. With pNFS clients can bypass the
server and perform I/O directly to storage devices. The
default can be explicitly requested with the <i>no_pnfs</i>
option.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>User ID
Mapping <br>
nfsd</b> bases its access control to files on the server
machine on the uid and gid provided in each NFS RPC request.
The normal behavior a user would expect is that she can
access her files on the server just as she would on a normal
file system. This requires that the same uids and gids are
used on the client and the server machine. This is not
always true, nor is it always desirable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Very often, it
is not desirable that the root user on a client machine is
also treated as root when accessing files on the NFS server.
To this end, uid 0 is normally mapped to a different id: the
so-called anonymous or <i>nobody</i> uid. This mode of
operation (called &lsquo;root squashing&rsquo;) is the
default, and can be turned off with
<i>no_root_squash</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>exportfs</b> chooses a uid and gid of 65534 for squashed
access. These values can also be overridden by the
<i>anonuid</i> and <i>anongid</i> options. Finally, you can
map all user requests to the anonymous uid by specifying the
<i>all_squash</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
the complete list of mapping options: <i><br>
root_squash</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Map requests from uid/gid 0 to
the anonymous uid/gid. Note that this does not apply to any
other uids or gids that might be equally sensitive, such as
user <i>bin</i> or group <i>staff</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>no_root_squash</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turn off root squashing. This
option is mainly useful for diskless clients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>all_squash</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Map all uids and gids to the
anonymous user. Useful for NFS-exported public FTP
directories, news spool directories, etc. The opposite
option is <i>no_all_squash</i>, which is the default
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>anonuid</i> and
<i>anongid</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options explicitly set
the uid and gid of the anonymous account. This option is
primarily useful for PC/NFS clients, where you might want
all requests appear to be from one user. As an example,
consider the export entry for <b>/home/joe</b> in the
example section below, which maps all requests to uid 150
(which is supposedly that of user joe).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extra Export
Tables</b> <br>
After reading <i>/etc/exports</i> <b>exportfs</b> reads
files in the <i>/etc/exports.d</i> directory as extra export
tables. Only files ending in <i>.exports</i> are considered.
Files beginning with a dot are ignored. The format for extra
export tables is the same as <i>/etc/exports</i></p>
