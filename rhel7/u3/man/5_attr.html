<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">attr - Extended
attributes</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are name:value pairs associated permanently with
files and directories, similar to the environment strings
associated with a process. An attribute may be defined or
undefined. If it is defined, its value may be empty or
non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are extensions to the normal attributes which are
associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the
<b>stat</b>(2) data). They are often used to provide
additional functionality to a filesystem &minus; for
example, additional security features such as Access Control
Lists (ACLs) may be implemented using extended
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users with
search access to a file or directory may retrieve a list of
attribute names defined for that file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extended
attributes are accessed as atomic objects. Reading retrieves
the whole value of an attribute and stores it in a buffer.
Writing replaces any previous value with the new value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Space consumed
for extended attributes is counted towards the disk quotas
of the file owner and file group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
support for extended attributes is implemented on Linux by
the ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS, JFS and reiserfs filesystems.</p>

<h2>EXTENDED ATTRIBUTE NAMESPACES
<a name="EXTENDED ATTRIBUTE NAMESPACES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attribute names
are zero-terminated strings. The attribute name is always
specified in the fully qualified <i>namespace.attribute</i>
form, eg. <i>user.mime_type</i>, <i>trusted.md5sum</i>,
<i>system.posix_acl_access</i>, or
<i>security.selinux</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The namespace
mechanism is used to define different classes of extended
attributes. These different classes exist for several
reasons, e.g. the permissions and capabilities required for
manipulating extended attributes of one namespace may differ
to another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
<i>security</i>, <i>system</i>, <i>trusted</i>, and
<i>user</i> extended attribute classes are defined as
described below. Additional classes may be added in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
security attributes</b> <br>
The security attribute namespace is used by kernel security
modules, such as Security Enhanced Linux. Read and write
access permissions to security attributes depend on the
policy implemented for each security attribute by the
security module. When no security module is loaded, all
processes have read access to extended security attributes,
and write access is limited to processes that have the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
system attributes</b> <br>
Extended system attributes are used by the kernel to store
system objects such as Access Control Lists and
Capabilities. Read and write access permissions to system
attributes depend on the policy implemented for each system
attribute implemented by filesystems in the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Trusted
extended attributes</b> <br>
Trusted extended attributes are visible and accessible only
to processes that have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (the
super user usually has this capability). Attributes in this
class are used to implement mechanisms in user space (i.e.,
outside the kernel) which keep information in extended
attributes to which ordinary processes should not have
access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
user attributes</b> <br>
Extended user attributes may be assigned to files and
directories for storing arbitrary additional information
such as the mime type, character set or encoding of a file.
The access permissions for user attributes are defined by
the file permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
permission bits of regular files and directories are
interpreted differently from the file permission bits of
special files and symbolic links. For regular files and
directories the file permission bits define access to the
file&rsquo;s contents, while for device special files they
define access to the device described by the special file.
The file permissions of symbolic links are not used in
access checks. These differences would allow users to
consume filesystem resources in a way not controllable by
disk quotas for group or world writable special files and
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For this
reason, extended user attributes are only allowed for
regular files and directories, and access to extended user
attributes is restricted to the owner and to users with
appropriate capabilities for directories with the sticky bit
set (see the <b>chmod</b>(1) manual page for an explanation
of Sticky Directories).</p>

<h2>FILESYSTEM DIFFERENCES
<a name="FILESYSTEM DIFFERENCES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The kernel and
the filesystem may place limits on the maximum number and
size of extended attributes that can be associated with a
file. Some file systems, such as ext2/3 and reiserfs,
require the filesystem to be mounted with the
<b>user_xattr</b> mount option in order for extended user
attributes to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the current
ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystem implementations, each
extended attribute must fit on a single filesystem block
(1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes, depending on the block size
specified when the filesystem was created).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the XFS and
reiserfs filesystem implementations, there is no practical
limit on the number or size of extended attributes
associated with a file, and the algorithms used to store
extended attribute information on disk are scalable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the JFS
filesystem implementation, names can be up to 255 bytes and
values up to 65,535 bytes.</p>

<h2>ADDITIONAL NOTES
<a name="ADDITIONAL NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
filesystems on which extended attributes are stored might
also be used on architectures with a different byte order
and machine word size, care should be taken to store
attribute values in an architecture independent format.</p>
