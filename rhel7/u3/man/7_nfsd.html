special filesystem for controlling Linux NFS server</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>nfsd</b>
filesystem is a special filesystem which provides access to
the Linux NFS server. The filesystem consists of a single
directory which contains a number of files. These files are
actually gateways into the NFS server. Writing to them can
affect the server. Reading from them can provide information
about the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This file
system is only available in Linux 2.6 and later series
kernels (and in the later parts of the 2.5 development
series leading up to 2.6). This man page does not apply to
2.4 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As well as this
filesystem, there are a collection of files in the
<b>procfs</b> filesystem (normally mounted at <b>/proc</b>)
which are used to control the NFS server. This manual page
describes all of these files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>exportfs</i> and <i>mountd</i> programs (part of the
nfs-utils package) expect to find this filesystem mounted at
<b>/proc/fs/nfsd</b> or <b>/proc/fs/nfs</b>. If it is not
mounted, they will fall-back on 2.4 style functionality.
This involves accessing the NFS server via a systemcall.
This systemcall is scheduled to be removed after the 2.6
kernel series.</p>

<h2>DETAILS
<a name="DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The three files
in the <b>nfsd</b> filesystem are: <b><br>
exports</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains a list of
filesystems that are currently exported and clients that
each filesystem is exported to, together with a list of
export options for that client/filesystem pair. This is
similar to the <b>/proc/fs/nfs/exports</b> file in 2.4. One
difference is that a client doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
correspond to just one host. It can respond to a large
collection of hosts that are being treated identically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each line of
the file contains a path name, a client name, and a number
of options in parentheses. Any space, tab, newline or
back-slash character in the path name or client name will be
replaced by a backslash followed by the octal ASCII code for
that character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>threads</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file represents the number
of <b>nfsd</b> thread currently running. Reading it will
show the number of threads. Writing an ASCII decimal number
will cause the number of threads to be changed (increased or
decreased as necessary) to achieve that number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>filehandle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a somewhat unusual file
in that what is read from it depends on what was just
written to it. It provides a transactional interface where a
program can open the file, write a request, and read a
response. If two separate programs open, write, and read at
the same time, their requests will not be mixed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The request
written to <b>filehandle</b> should be a client name, a path
name, and a number of bytes. This should be followed by a
newline, with white-space separating the fields, and octal
quoting of special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On writing
this, the program will be able to read back a filehandle for
that path as exported to the given client. The
filehandle&rsquo;s length will be at most the number of
bytes given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The filehandle
will be represented in hex with a leading
&rsquo;\x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The directory
<b>/proc/net/rpc</b> in the <b>procfs</b> filesystem
contains a number of files and directories. The files
contain statistics that can be display using the
<i>nfsstat</i> program. The directories contain information
about various caches that the NFS server maintains to keep
track of access permissions that different clients have for
different filesystems. The caches are: <b><br>
auth.domain</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This cache maps the name of a
client (or domain) to an internal data structure. The only
access that is possible is to flush the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auth.unix.ip</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This cache contains a mapping
from IP address to the name of the authentication domain
that the ipaddress should be treated as part of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nfsd.export</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This cache contains a mapping
from directory and domain to export options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nfsd.fh</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This cache contains a mapping
from domain and a filesystem identifier to a directory. The
filesystem identifier is stored in the filehandles and
consists of a number indicating the type of identifier and a
number of hex bytes indicating the content of the
identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each directory
representing a cache can hold from 1 to 3 files. They
are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>flush</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When a number of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970) is
written to this file, all entries in the cache that were
last updated before that file become invalidated and will be
flushed out. Writing 1 will flush everything. This is the
only file that will always be present.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>content</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file, if present, contains
a textual representation of ever entry in the cache, one per
line. If an entry is still in the cache (because it is
actively being used) but has expired or is otherwise
invalid, it will be presented as a comment (with a leading
hash character).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>channel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file, if present, acts a
channel for request from the kernel-based nfs server to be
passed to a user-space program for handling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the kernel
needs some information which isn&rsquo;t in the cache, it
makes a line appear in the <b>channel</b> file giving the
key for the information. A user-space program should read
this, find the answer, and write a line containing the key,
an expiry time, and the content. For example the kernel
might make <br>
nfsd 127.0.0.1 <br>
appear in the <b>auth.unix.ip/content</b> file. The
user-space program might then write <br>
nfsd 127.0.0.1 1057206953 localhost <br>
to indicate that 127.0.0.1 should map to localhost, at least
for now.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the program
uses select(2) or poll(2) to discover if it can read from
the <b>channel</b> then it will never see and end-of-file
but when all requests have been answered, it will block
until another request appears.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
<b>/proc</b> filesystem there are 4 files that can be used
to enabled extra tracing of nfsd and related code. They
are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
<br>
/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug <br>
/proc/sys/sunrpc/nlm_debug <br>
/proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">They control tracing for the
NFS client, the NFS server, the Network Lock Manager (lockd)
and the underlying RPC layer respectively. Decimal numbers
can be read from or written to these files. Each number
represents a bit-pattern where bits that are set cause
certain classes of tracing to be enabled. Consult the kernel
header files to find out what number correspond to what
tracing.</p>
