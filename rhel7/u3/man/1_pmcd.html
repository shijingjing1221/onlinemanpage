<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmcd</b> is
the collector used by the Performance Co-Pilot (see
<b>PCPIntro</b>(1)) to gather performance metrics on a
system. As a rule, there must be an instance of <b>pmcd</b>
running on a system for any performance metrics to be
available to the PCP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmcd</b>
accepts connections from client applications running either
on the same machine or remotely and provides them with
metrics and other related information from the machine that
<b>pmcd</b> is executing on. <b>pmcd</b> delegates most of
this request servicing to a collection of Performance
Metrics Domain Agents (or just agents), where each agent is
responsible for a particular group of metrics, known as the
domain of the agent. For example the <b>postgresql</b> agent
is responsible for reporting information relating to the
PostgreSQL database, such as the transaction and query
counts, indexing and replication statistics, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The agents may
be processes started by <b>pmcd</b>, independent processes
or Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs, see <b>dlopen</b>(3))
attached to <b>pmcd</b>&rsquo;s address space. The
configuration section below describes how connections to
agents are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options to
<b>pmcd</b> are as follows.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;A</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Disable service advertisement. By default, <b>pmcd</b>
will advertise its presence on the network using any
available mechanisms (such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting
remote monitoring tools with finding it. These mechanisms
are disabled with this option.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>
<i>config</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">On startup <b>pmcd</b> uses a
configuration file from either the
<i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>, configuration variable in
<i>/etc/pcp.conf</i>, or an environment variable of the same
name. However, these values may be overridden with
<i>config</i> using this option. The format of this
configuration file is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b>
<i>dirname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to the Network
Security Services certificate database, for (optional)
secure connections. The default is <b>/etc/pki/nssdb</b>.
Refer also to the <b>&minus;P</b> option. If it does not
already exist, this database can be created using the
<b>certutil</b> utility. This process and other certificate
database maintenance information is provided in the
<b>PCPIntro</b>(1) manual page and the online PCP
tutorials.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;f</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>By default <b>pmcd</b> is started as a daemon. The
<b>&minus;f</b> option indicates that it should run in the
foreground. This is most useful when trying to diagnose
problems with misbehaving agents.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;H</b>
<i>hostname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option can be used to set
the hostname that <b>pmcd</b> will use to represent this
instance of itself. This is used by client tools like
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) when reporting on the (possibly remote)
host. If this option is not set, the pmcd.hostname metric
will match that returned by <b>pmhostname</b>(1). Refer to
the manual page for that tool for full details on how the
hostname is evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i</b>
<i>ipaddress</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is usually only
used on hosts with more than one network interface. If no
<b>&minus;i</b> options are specified <b>pmcd</b> accepts
connections made to any of its host&rsquo;s IP (Internet
Protocol) addresses. The <b>&minus;i</b> option is used to
specify explicitly an IP address that connections should be
accepted on. <i>ipaddress</i> should be in the standard
dotted form (e.g. 100.23.45.6). The <b>&minus;i</b> option
may be used multiple times to define a list of IP addresses.
Connections made to any other IP addresses the host has will
be refused. This can be used to limit connections to one
network interface if the host is a network gateway. It is
also useful if the host takes over the IP address of another
host that has failed. In such a situation only the standard
IP addresses of the host should be given (not the ones
inherited from the failed host). This allows PCP
applications to determine that a host has failed, rather
than connecting to the host that has assumed the identity of
the failed host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b>
<i>logfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default a log file named
<i>pmcd.log</i> is written in the directory
<b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>. The <b>&minus;l</b> option causes
the log file to be written to <i>logfile</i> instead of the
default. If the log file cannot be created or is not
writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b>
<i>bytes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>PDU</i>s received by
<b>pmcd</b> from monitoring clients are restricted to a
maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to defend against
Denial of Service attacks. The <b>&minus;L</b> option may be
used to change the maximum incoming <i>PDU</i> size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;M</b>
<i>certname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, pmcd will try to
use a certificate called <b>PCP Collector certificate .</b>
The <b>&minus;M</b> option allows this to be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;n</b>
<i>pmnsfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Normally <b>pmcd</b> loads the
default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) from
<b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</b>, however if the
<b>&minus;n</b> option is specified an alternative namespace
is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;N</b>
<i>pmnsfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same function as
<b>&minus;n</b>, except for the handling of duplicate
Performance Metric Identifiers (PMIDs) in <i>pmnsfile</i>
&minus; duplicate names are allowed with <b>&minus;n</b>
they are not allowed with <b>&minus;N</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;P</b>
<i>passfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to a file
containing the Network Security Services certificate
database password for (optional) secure connections, and for
databases that are password protected. Refer also to the
<b>&minus;C</b> option. When using this option, great care
should be exercised to ensure appropriate ownership
(&quot;pcp&quot; user, typically) and permissions on this
file (0400, so as to be unreadable by any user other than
the user running the <b>pmcd</b> process).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;q</b>
<i>timeout</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The pmcd to agent version
exchange protocol (new in PCP 2.0 - introduced to provide
backward compatibility) uses this timeout to specify how
long pmcd should wait before assuming that no version
response is coming from an agent. If this timeout is
reached, the agent is assumed to be an agent which does not
understand the PCP 2.0 protocol. The default timeout
interval is five seconds, but the <b>&minus;q</b> option
allows an alternative timeout interval (which must be
greater than zero) to be specified. The unit of time is
seconds.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;Q</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Require that all remote client connections provide a
certficate.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;S</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Require that all client connections provide user
credentials. This means that only unix domain sockets, or
authenticated connections are permitted (requires secure
sockets support). If any user or group access control
requirements are specified in the pmcd configuration file,
then this mode of operation is automatically entered,
whether the <b>&minus;S</b> flag is specified or not.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>sockname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to a local
unix domain socket (for platforms supporting this socket
family only). The default value is
<i>$PCP_RUN_DIR/pmcd.socket</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t</b>
<i>timeout</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To prevent misbehaving clients
or agents from hanging the entire Performance Metrics
Collection System (PMCS), <b>pmcd</b> uses timeouts on PDU
exchanges with clients and agents running as processes. By
default the timeout interval is five seconds. The
<b>&minus;t</b> option allows an alternative timeout
interval in seconds to be specified. If <i>timeout</i> is
zero, timeouts are turned off. It is almost impossible to
use the debugger interactively on an agent unless timeouts
have been turned off for its &quot;parent&quot;
<b>pmcd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Once
<b>pmcd</b> is running, the timeout may be dynamically
modified by storing an integer value (the timeout in
seconds) into the metric <b>pmcd.control.timeout</b> via
<b>pmstore</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;T</b>
<i>traceflag</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To assist with error diagnosis
for agents and/or clients of <b>pmcd</b> that are not
behaving correctly, an internal event tracing mechanism is
supported within <b>pmcd</b>. The value of <i>traceflag</i>
is interpreted as a bit field with the following control
functions:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>1</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="49%">


<p>enable client connection tracing</p></td>
<td width="23%">
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>2</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>

<p><b>256</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="49%">


<p>unbuffered event tracing</p></td>
<td width="23%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
event tracing is buffered using a circular buffer that is
over-written as new events are recorded. The default buffer
size holds the last 20 events, although this number may be
over-ridden by using <b>pmstore</b>(1) to modify the metric
<b>pmcd.control.tracebufs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly once
<b>pmcd</b> is running, the event tracing control may be
dynamically modified by storing 1 (enable) or 0 (disable)
into the metrics <b>pmcd.control.traceconn</b>,
<b>pmcd.control.tracepdu</b> and
<b>pmcd.control.tracenobuf</b>. These metrics map to the bit
fields associated with the <i>traceflag</i> argument for the
<b>&minus;T</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When operating
in buffered mode, the event trace buffer will be dumped
whenever an agent connection is terminated by <b>pmcd</b>,
or when any value is stored into the metric
<b>pmcd.control.dumptrace</b> via <b>pmstore</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In unbuffered
mode, <b>every</b> event will be reported when it
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;U</b>
<i>username</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">User account under which to run
<b>pmcd</b>. The default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot;
account in current versions of PCP, but in older versions
the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by
default.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Verify the <b>pmcd</b> configuration file, reporting on
any errors then exiting with a status indicating
verification success or failure.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Before the <b>pmcd</b>
<i>logfile</i> can be opened, <b>pmcd</b> may encounter a
fatal error which prevents it from starting. By default, the
output describing this error is sent to <b>/dev/tty</b> but
it may redirected to <i>file</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a PDU
exchange with an agent times out, the agent has violated the
requirement that it delivers metrics with little or no
delay. This is deemed a protocol failure and the agent is
disconnected from <b>pmcd</b>. Any subsequent requests for
information from the agent will fail with a status
indicating that there is no agent to provide it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify access control to <b>pmcd</b> based on users,
groups and hosts. This allows one to prevent users, groups
of users, and certain hosts from accessing the metrics
provided by <b>pmcd</b> and is described in more detail in
the Section on ACCESS CONTROL below.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On startup
<b>pmcd</b> looks for a configuration file named
<i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>. This file specifies which agents
cover which performance metrics domains and how <b>pmcd</b>
should make contact with the agents. An optional section
specifying access controls may follow the agent
configuration data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning</b>:
<b>pmcd</b> is usually started as part of the boot sequence
and runs initially as root. The configuration file may
contain shell commands to create agents, which will be
executed by root. To prevent security breaches the
configuration file should be writable only by root. The use
of absolute path names is also recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The case of the
reserved words in the configuration file is unimportant, but
elsewhere, the case is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and
comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the
configuration file. A comment begins with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; character and finishes at the
end of the line. A line may be continued by ensuring that
the last character on the line is a
&lsquo;&lsquo;\&rsquo;&rsquo; (backslash). A comment on a
continued line ends at the end of the continued line. Spaces
may be included in lexical elements by enclosing the entire
element in double quotes. A double quote preceded by a
backslash is always a literal double quote. A
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; in double quotes or preceded
by a backslash is treated literally rather than as a comment
delimiter. Lexical elements and separators are described
further in the following sections.</p>

<h2>AGENT CONFIGURATION
<a name="AGENT CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line of
the agent configuration section of the configuration file
contains details of how to connect <b>pmcd</b> to one of its
agents and specifies which metrics domain the agent deals
with. An agent may be attached as a DSO, or via a socket, or
a pair of pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line of
the agent configuration section of the configuration file
must be either an agent specification, a comment, or a blank
line. Lexical elements are separated by whitespace
characters, however a single agent specification may not be
broken across lines unless a <b>\</b> (backslash) is used to
continue the line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each agent
specification must start with a textual label (string)
followed by an integer in the range 1 to 510. The label is a
tag used to refer to the agent and the integer specifies the
domain for which the agent supplies data. This domain
identifier corresponds to the domain portion of the PMIDs
handled by the agent. Each agent must have a unique label
and domain identifier.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Access to
<b>pmcd</b> can be granted in three ways - by user, group of
users, or at a host level. In the latter, all users on a
host are granted the same level of access, unless the user
or group access control mechanism is also in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">User names and
group names will be verified using the local
<b>/etc/passwd</b> and <b>/etc/groups</b> files (or an
alternative directory service), using the <b>getpwent</b>(3)
and <b>getgrent</b>(3) routines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hosts may be
identified by name, IP address, IPv6 address or by the
special host specifications
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;unix:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;local:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;.
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;unix:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to
<b>pmcd&rsquo;s</b> unix domain socket, on supported
platforms. &lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;local:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; is
equivalent to specifying
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;unix:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;localhost&lsquo;&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wildcards may
also be specified by ending the host identifier with the
single wildcard character &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; as
the last-given component of an address. The wildcard
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;.*&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to all
inet (IPv4) addresses. The wildcard
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;:*&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to all
IPv6 addresses. If an IPv6 wildcard contains a
&lsquo;&lsquo;::&rsquo;&rsquo; component, then the final
&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to the final 16 bits of
the address only, otherwise it refers to the remaining
unspecified bits of the address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The wildcard
&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; refers to all users, groups or
host addresses, including
&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;unix:&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;. Names of
users, groups or hosts may not be wildcarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
example is not allowed because only (numeric) IP addresses
may contain a wildcard. The second and fifth examples are
not valid because there is more than one wildcard character.
The third and sixth contain an embedded wildcard, the fourth
and seventh have a wildcard character that is not the last
component of the address (the last components are
<tt>127*</tt> and <tt>fe80*</tt> respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name
<b>localhost</b> is given special treatment to make the
behavior of host wildcarding consistent. Rather than being
127.0.0.1 and ::1, it is mapped to the primary inet and IPv6
addresses associated with the name of the host on which
<b>pmcd</b> is running. Beware of this when running
<b>pmcd</b> on multi-homed hosts.</p>

<b>hosts</b> keywords are allowed. If this keyword is
omitted, a default of <b>hosts</b> will be used. This
behaviour is for backward-compatibility only, it is
preferable to be explicit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where no
specific <b>allow</b> or <b>disallow</b> statement applies
to an operation, the default is to allow the operation from
all users, groups and hosts. In the trivial case when there
is no access control section in the configuration file, all
operations from all users, groups, and hosts are
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a new
connection to <b>pmcd</b> is attempted by a user, group or

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Statements with
the same level of wildcarding specifying identical hosts may
not contradict each other. For example if a host named
<b>clank</b> had an IP address of 129.127.112.2, specifying
the following two rules would be erroneous:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">allow host clank : fetch, store;
disallow host 129.127.112.2 : all except fetch;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">because they
both refer to the same host, but disagree as to whether the
<b>fetch</b> operation is permitted from that host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Statements
containing more specific host specifications override less
specific ones according to the level of wildcarding. For
example a rule of the form</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">allow host clank : all;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">overrides</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">disallow host 129.127.112.* : all except fetch;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">because the
former contains a specific host name (equivalent to a fully
specified IP address), whereas the latter has a wildcard. In
turn, the latter would override</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">disallow host * : all;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to limit the number of connections from a user, group or

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<i>operations</i> list of an <b>allow</b> statement. Such a
clause may not be used in a <b>disallow</b> statement. Here,
<i>n</i> is the maximum number of connections that will be
accepted from the user, group or host matching the
identifier(s) used in the statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An access
control statement with a list of user, group or host
identifiers is equivalent to a set of access control
statements, with each specifying one of the identifiers in
the list and all with the same access controls (both
permissions and connection limits). A group should be used
if you want users to contribute to a shared connection
limit. A wildcard should be used if you want hosts to
contribute to a shared connection limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a new
client requests a connection, and <b>pmcd</b> has determined
that the client has permission to connect, it searches the
matching list of access control statements for the most
specific match containing a connection limit. For brevity,
this will be called the limiting statement. If there is no
limiting statement, the client is granted a connection. If
there is a limiting statement and the number of <b>pmcd</b>
clients with user ID, group ID, or IP addresses that match
the identifier in the limiting statement is less than the
connection limit in the statement, the connection is
allowed. Otherwise the connection limit has been reached and
the client is refused a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Group access
controls and the wildcarding in host identifiers means that
once <b>pmcd</b> actually accepts a connection from a
client, the connection may contribute to the current
connection count of more than one access control statement
&minus; the client&rsquo;s host may match more than one
access control statement, and similarly the user ID may be
in more than one group. This may be significant for
subsequent connection requests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>pmcd</b> enters a mode where it runs effectively with a
higher-level of security as soon as a user or group access
control section is added to the configuration. In this mode
only authenticated connections are allowed &minus; either
from a SASL authenticated connection, or a Unix domain
socket (which implicitly passes client credentials). This is
the same mode that is entered explicitly using the
<b>&minus;S</b> option. Assuming permission is allowed, one
can determine whether <b>pmcd</b> is running in this mode by
querying the value of the <i>pmcd.feature.creds_required</i>
metric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
because most specific match semantics are used when checking
the connection limit, for the host-based access control
case, priority is given to clients with more specific host
identifiers. It is also possible to exceed connection limits
in some situations. Consider the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">allow host
clank : all, maximum 5 connections; <br>
allow host * : all except store, maximum 2 connections;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This says that
only 2 client connections at a time are permitted for all
hosts other than &quot;clank&quot;, which is permitted 5. If
a client from host &quot;boing&quot; is the first to connect
to <b>pmcd</b>, its connection is checked against the second
statement (that is the most specific match with a connection
limit). As there are no other clients, the connection is
accepted and contributes towards the limit for only the
second statement above. If the next client connects from
&quot;clank&quot;, its connection is checked against the
limit for the first statement. There are no other
connections from &quot;clank&quot;, so the connection is
accepted. Once this connection is accepted, it counts
towards <b>both</b> statements&rsquo; limits because
&quot;clank&quot; matches the host identifier in both
statements. Remember that the decision to accept a new
connection is made using only the most specific matching
access control statement with a connection limit. Now, the
connection limit for the second statement has been reached.
Any connections from hosts other than &quot;clank&quot; will
be refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If instead,
<b>pmcd</b> with no clients saw three successive connections
arrived from &quot;boing&quot;, the first two would be
accepted and the third refused. After that, if a connection
was requested from &quot;clank&quot; it would be accepted.
It matches the first statement, which is more specific than
the second, so the connection limit in the first is used to
determine that the client has the right to connect. Now
there are 3 connections contributing to the second
statement&rsquo;s connection limit. Even though the
connection limit for the second statement has been exceeded,
the earlier connections from &quot;boing&quot; are
maintained. The connection limit is only checked at the time
a client attempts a connection rather than being
re-evaluated every time a new client connects to
<b>pmcd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This gentle
scheme is designed to allow reasonable limits to be imposed
on a first come first served basis, with specific
exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As illustrated
by the example above, a client&rsquo;s connection is honored
once it has been accepted. However, <b>pmcd</b>
reconfiguration (see the next section) re-evaluates all the
connection counts and will cause client connections to be
dropped where connection limits have been exceeded.</p>

<h2>RECONFIGURING PMCD
<a name="RECONFIGURING PMCD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
configuration file has been changed or if an agent is not
responding because it has terminated or the PMNS has been
changed, <b>pmcd</b> may be reconfigured by sending it a
SIGHUP, as in</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"># pmsignal &minus;a &minus;s HUP pmcd</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>pmcd</b> receives a SIGHUP, it checks the configuration
file for changes. If the file has been modified, it is
reparsed and the contents become the new configuration. If
there are errors in the configuration file, the existing
configuration is retained and the contents of the file are
ignored. Errors are reported in the <b>pmcd</b> log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It also checks
the PMNS file for changes. If the PMNS file has been
modified, then it is reloaded. Use of <b>tail</b>(1) on the
log file is recommended while reconfiguring <b>pmcd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
configuration for an agent has changed (any parameter except
the agent&rsquo;s label is different), the agent is
restarted. Agents whose configurations do not change are not
restarted. Any existing agents not present in the new
configuration are terminated. Any deceased agents are that
are still listed are restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is
necessary to restart an agent that is still running, but
malfunctioning. Simply stop the agent (e.g. using SIGTERM
from <b>pmsignal</b>(1)), then send <b>pmcd</b> a SIGHUP,
which will cause the agent to be restarted.</p>

<h2>STARTING AND STOPPING PMCD
<a name="STARTING AND STOPPING PMCD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
<b>pmcd</b> is started automatically at boot time and
stopped when the system is being brought down. Under certain
circumstances it is necessary to start or stop <b>pmcd</b>
manually. To do this one must become superuser and type</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmcd start</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to start
<b>pmcd</b>, or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmcd stop</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to stop
<b>pmcd</b>. Starting <b>pmcd</b> when it is already running
is the same as stopping it and then starting it again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it
may be necessary to restart <b>pmcd</b> during another phase
of the boot process. Time-consuming parts of the boot
process are often put into the background to allow the
system to become available sooner (e.g. mounting huge
databases). If an agent run by <b>pmcd</b> requires such a
task to complete before it can run properly, it is necessary
to restart or reconfigure <b>pmcd</b> after the task
completes. Consider, for example, the case of mounting a
database in the background while booting. If the PMDA which
provides the metrics about the database cannot function
until the database is mounted and available but <b>pmcd</b>
is started before the database is ready, the PMDA will fail
(however <b>pmcd</b> will still service requests for metrics
from other domains). If the database is initialized by
running a shell script, adding a line to the end of the
script to reconfigure <b>pmcd</b> (by sending it a SIGHUP)
will restart the PMDA (if it exited because it
couldn&rsquo;t connect to the database). If the PMDA
didn&rsquo;t exit in such a situation it would be necessary
to restart <b>pmcd</b> because if the PMDA was still running
<b>pmcd</b> would not restart it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
<b>pmcd</b> listens for client connections on TCP/IP port
number 44321 (registered at <i>http://www.iana.org/</i>).
Either the environment variable <b>PMCD_PORT</b> or the
<b>&minus;p</b> command line option may be used to specify
alternative port number(s) when <b>pmcd</b> is started; in
each case, the specification is a comma-separated list of
one or more numerical port numbers. Should both methods be
used or multiple <b>&minus;p</b> options appear on the
command line, <b>pmcd</b> will listen on the union of the
set of ports specified via all <b>&minus;p</b> options and
the <b>PMCD_PORT</b> environment variable. If non-default
ports are used with <b>pmcd</b> care should be taken to
ensure that <b>PMCD_PORT</b> is also set in the environment
of any client application that will connect to <b>pmcd</b>,
or that the extended host specification syntax is used (see

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If set to the

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>pmcd</b>
is already running the message &quot;Error:
OpenRequestSocket bind: Address may already be in use&quot;
will appear. This may also appear if <b>pmcd</b> was
shutdown with an outstanding request from a client. In this
case, a request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state
and until the system closes it down (after some timeout
period) it will not be possible to run <b>pmcd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the standard <b>PCP</b> debugging flags, see
<b>pmdbg</b>(1), <b>pmcd</b> currently uses
<b>DBG_TRACE_APPL0</b> for tracing I/O and termination of
agents, <b>DBG_TRACE_APPL1</b> for tracing access control
and <b>DBG_TRACE_APPL2</b> for tracing the configuration
file scanner and parser.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmcd</b>
does not explicitly terminate its children (agents), it only
closes their pipes. If an agent never checks for a closed
pipe it may not terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration file parser will only read lines of less than
1200 characters. This is intended to prevent accidents with
binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The timeouts
controlled by the <b>&minus;t</b> option apply to IPC
between <b>pmcd</b> and the PMDAs it spawns. This is
independent of settings of the environment variables
<b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> and <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
(see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1)) which may be used respectively to
control timeouts for client applications trying to connect
to <b>pmcd</b> and trying to receive information from
<b>pmcd</b>.</p>
