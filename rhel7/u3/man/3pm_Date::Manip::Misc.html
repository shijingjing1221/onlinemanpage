<h2>SHOULD I USE DATE::MANIP
<a name="SHOULD I USE DATE::MANIP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you look in
<small>CPAN,</small> you&rsquo;ll find that there are a
number of Date and Time packages. Is Date::Manip the one you
should be using? That isn&rsquo;t a trivial question to
answer. It depends to a large extent on what you are trying
to do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip is
certainly one of the most powerful of the Date modules (the
other main contender being the DateTime suite of modules).
I&rsquo;m trying to build a library which can do _EVERY_
conceivable date/time manipulation that you&rsquo;ll run
into in everyday life dealing with the Gregorian calendar.
To the best of my knowledge, it will do everything that any
other date module will do which work with the Gregorian
calendar, and there are a number of features that
Date::Manip has that other modules do not have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
tradeoff in being able to do &quot;everything&quot;... and
that tradeoff is primarily in terms of performance.
Date::Manip is written entirely in Perl and is the largest
of the date modules. Other modules tend to be faster than
Date::Manip, and modules written in C are significantly
faster than their Perl counterparts (at least if
they&rsquo;re done right). Although I am working on making
Date::Manip faster, it will never be as fast as other
modules. And before anyone asks, Date::Manip will never be
translated to C (at least by me). I write C because I have
to. I write Perl because I like to. Date::Manip is something
I do because it interests me, not something I&rsquo;m paid
for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
going to be using the module in cases where performance is
an important factor, and you&rsquo;re doing a fairly small
set of simple date operations over and over again, you
should carefully examine the other date modules to see if
they will meet your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
does <small>NOT</small> provide functionality for working
with alternate calendars such as the Chinese or Hebrew
calendars, so if you need that functionality, you definitely
need to look elsewhere (the DateTime suite probably).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you want one solution for all your date needs,
don&rsquo;t need peak speed, or are trying to do more exotic
date operations, Date::Manip is for you. Operations on
things like business dates, foreign language dates, holidays
and other recurring events, complete timezone handling, etc.
are available more-or-less exclusively in Date::Manip. At
the very least, if you want to be able to do these
operations, it will require using several other modules,
each with it&rsquo;s own interface. Also, when you work with
Date::Manip, you work with one author and one module. The
DateTime suite currently consists of almost 100 modules and
75 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition, I
am making significant performance improvements in
Date::Manip. Although it will never be as fast as some of
the other perl modules, I believe that it is already
competitive enough for most purposes, and I continue to look
for places where I can improve performance, so performance
should improve over time.</p>

<h2>YEAR 2000 AND YEAR 2007 DST CHANGE
<a name="YEAR 2000 AND YEAR 2007 DST CHANGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Did Date::Manip
have any problems with Y2K compliance? Did it have any
problems with the revised daylight saving time changes made
in 2007?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
Date::Manip will parse many date strings (including dates
with 2&minus;digit years), internally they are stored as a 4
digit year, and all operations are performed using this
internal representation, so Date::Manip had no problems with
the Y2K issue. Of course, applications written which stored
the year as 2 digits (whether or not it used Date::Manip)
may have had problems, but they were not because of this
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly for
the 2007 changes in daylight saving time made in the United
States, Date::Manip was not affected. Date::Manip makes use
of the current time zone, but it gets that information from
the operating system the application is running on. If the
operating system knows about the new daylight saving time
rules... so does Date::Manip.</p>

<h2>WHAT DATES ARE DATE::MANIP USEFUL FOR?
<a name="WHAT DATES ARE DATE::MANIP USEFUL FOR?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
applies to the Gregorian calendar. It does not support
alternative calendars (Hebrew, Mayan, etc.) so if you want
to use an alternative calendar, you&rsquo;ll need to look
elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Gregorian
calendar is a relatively recent innovation. Prior to it, the
Julian calendar was in use. The Julian calendar defined leap
years as every 4th year. This led to significant calendar
drift over time (since a year is <small>NOT 365.24</small>
days long). It was replaced by the Gregorian calendar which
improved the definition of leap years, and at that point,
the calendar was adjusted appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
extrapolates the Gregorian calendar back to the year 0001
<small>AD</small> and forward to the year 9999
<small>AD,</small> but that does not necessarily mean that
the results are useful. As the world adopted the Gregorian
calendar, the dates using the Julian calendar had to be
changed to fit to account for the drift that had occurred.
As such, the dates produced by Date::Manip in an era where
the Julian calendar was in use do not accurately reflect the
dates actually in use. In historical context, the Julian
calendar was in use until 1582 when the Gregorian calendar
was adopted by the Catholic church. Protestant countries did
not accept it until later; Germany and Netherlands in 1698,
British Empire in 1752, Russia in 1918, etc. Date::Manip is
therefore not equipped to truly deal with historical dates
prior to about 1600, and between 1600 and 1900, the calendar
varied from country to country.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A second
problem is that the Gregorian calendar is itself imperfect
and at some point may need to be corrected (though
it&rsquo;s not clear that this will happen... drift may now
be accounted for using leap seconds which means that the
Gregorian calendar may be useful indefinitely). No attempt
is made to correct for the problems in the Gregorian
calendar for a couple reasons. First is that my great great
great grandchildren will be long dead before this begins to
be a problem, so it&rsquo;s not an immediate concern.
Secondly, and even more importantly, I don&rsquo;t know what
the correction will be (if any) or when it will be
implemented, so I can safely ignore it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
limitation on how dates can be expressed such that
Date::Manip can handle them correctly. Date::Manip stores
the year internally as a 4&minus;digit number. This is
obviously not a limit due to the Gregorian calendar, but I
needed a way to store the dates internally, and the
4&minus;digit year was chosen. I realize that the
4&minus;digit limitation does create a time when it will
break (quite similar to those who chose a 2&minus;digit
representation set themselves up for the Y2K problem).
Frankly, I&rsquo;m not too concerned about this since that
date is 8000 years in the future! Date::Manip won&rsquo;t
exist then. Perl won&rsquo;t exist then. And it&rsquo;s
quite possible that the Gregorian calendar won&rsquo;t exist
then. That&rsquo;s a much different situation than the Y2K
choice in which programmers chose a representation that
would break within the lifetime of the programs they were
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given the
4&minus;digit limitation, Date::Manip definitely can&rsquo;t
handle <small>BC</small> dates, or dates past Dec 31, 9999.
So Date::Manip works (in theory) during the period Jan 1,
0001 to Dec 31, 9999. There are a few caveats: <b><br>
Gregorian calendar issue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In practical terms, Date::Manip
deals with the Gregorian calendar, and is most useful in the
period that that calendar has been, or will be, in effect.
As explained above, the Gregorian calendar came into
universal acceptance in the early 1900&rsquo;s, and it
should remain in use for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So... in
practical terms, Date::Manip is probably useful from around
1900 through several thousand years from now.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>First/last week</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In one part of the code
(calculating week-of-year values), Date::Manip references
dates one week after and one week before the date actually
being worked on. As such, the first week in the year 0001
fail (because a week before is in the year 1
<small>BC</small> ), and the last week in the year 9999 fail
(because a week later is in 10,000).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">No effort will
be made to correct this because the added functionality is
simply not that important (to me), especially since the
Gregorian calendar doesn&rsquo;t really apply in either
instance. To be absolutely safe, I will state that
Date::Manip works as described in this manual during the
period Feb 1, 0001 to Nov 30, 9999, and I will only support
dates within that range (i.e. if you submit a bug using a
date that is not in that range, I will will consider myself
free to ignore it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Leap seconds</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip does
<small>NOT</small> make use of the leap seconds in
calculating time intervals, so the difference between two
times may not be strictly accurate due to the addition of a
leap second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Three-digit years</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip will parse both
2&minus; and 4&minus;digit years, but it will
<small>NOT</small> handle 3 digit years. So, if you store
the year as an offset from 1900 (which is 3 digits long as
of the year 2000), these will <small>NOT</small> be
parseable by Date::Manip. Since the perl functions localtime
and gmtime <small>DO</small> return the year as an offset
from 1900, the output from these will need to be corrected
(probably by adding 1900 to the result) before they can be
passed to any Date::Manip routine.</p>

<h2>FUTURE IDEAS
<a name="FUTURE IDEAS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A number of
changes are being considered for future inclusion in
Date::Manip. As a rule, the changes listed below are not
finalized, and are open to discussion. <b><br>
Rewrite parsing for better language support</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Currently, all of
Date::Manip&rsquo;s parsing is based on English language
forms of dates, even if the words have been replaced by the
equivalent in some other language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I am
considering rewriting the parsing routines in order to allow
date forms that might be used in other languages but do not
have a common English equivalent, and to account for the
fact that some English formats may not have an equivalent in
another language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Adding granularity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The granularity of a time
basically refers to how accurate you wish to treat a date.
For example, if you want to compare two dates to see if they
are identical at a granularity of days, then they only have
to occur on the same day. At a granularity of an hour, they
have to occur within an hour of each other, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;m not
sure how useful this would be, but it&rsquo;s one of the
oldest unimplemented ideas, so I&rsquo;m not discarding it
completely.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
<a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
people who have contributed to Date::Manip over the years
that I&rsquo;d like to thank. The most important
contributions have come in the form of suggestions and bug
reports by users. I have tried to include the name of every
person who first suggested each improvement or first
reported each bug. These are included in the
Date::Manip::Changes5 and Date::Manip::Changes6 documents.
The list is simply too long to appear here, but I appreciate
their help.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A number of
people have made suggestions or reported bugs which are not
mentioned in these documents. These include suggestions
which have not been implemented and people who have made a
suggestion or bug report which has already been
suggested/reported by someone else. For those who&rsquo;s
suggestions have not yet been implemented, they will be
added to the appropriate Changes document when (if) their
suggestions are implemented. I keep every single suggestion
I&rsquo;ve ever received and periodically review the
unimplemented ones to see if it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m
interested in, so even suggestions made years in the past
may still appear in future versions of Date::Manip, and the
original requester will be attributed at that point (some of
the changes made to Date::Manip 6.00 were based on
suggestions 10 years old which never fit in with version
5.xx, but which I knew I wanted to implement). For those who
have sent in requests/reports that had been previously made
by someone else, thank you too. I&rsquo;d much rather have a
suggestion made twice than not at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Alan
Cezar and Greg Schiedler for paying me to implement the
Events_List routine. They gave me the idea, and were then
willing to pay me for my time to get it implemented
quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;d also
like to thank a couple of authors. Date::Manip has gotten
some really good press in a couple of books. Since no
one&rsquo;s paying me to write Date::Manip, seeing my module
get a good review in a book written by someone else really
makes my day. My thanks to Nate Padwardhan and Clay Irving
(Programming with Perl Modules -- part of the O&rsquo;Reilly
Perl Resource Kit); and Tom Christiansen and Nathan
Torkington (The Perl Cookbook). Also, thanks to any other
authors who&rsquo;ve written about Date::Manip who&rsquo;s
books I haven&rsquo;t seen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;d also
like to thank the people who are maintaining the zoneinfo
database (and who replied quickly to several inquiries).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I have borrowed
from other modules. I originally borrowed the code for
determining if a year was a leap year from code written by
David Muir Sharnoff. I borrowed many of the original date
printf formats from code written by Terry McGonigal as well
as the Solaris date command. More recently, I borrowed the
code to do time zone registry lookups on Windows from the
DateTime-TimeZone module, though I rewrote it to work better
with Date::Manip.</p>
