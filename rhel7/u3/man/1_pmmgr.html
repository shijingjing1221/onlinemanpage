<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmmgr</b>
manages a collection of PCP daemons for a set of discovered
local and remote hosts running the Performance Metrics
Collection Daemon (PMCD), according to zero or more
configuration directories. It keeps a matching set of
<b>pmlogger</b>, <b>pmie</b>, and other clients/daemons
running, and their archives/logs merged/rotated. It
supplants the older <b>pmlogger_*</b> and <b>pmie_*</b>
check/daily management shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pmmgr is
largely self-configuring and perseveres despite most
run-time errors. pmmgr runs in the foreground until
interrupted. When signaled, it will stop its running daemons
before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A description
of the command line options specific to <b>pmmgr</b>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>pmmgr</b>
configuration identifies which hosts should be monitored,
which daemons should be maintained for them, and what
options those daemons should be run with. pmmgr uses a small
number of files in a configuration directory, instead of
lines in a text file. The individual files carry zero or
more lines of 100% pure configuration text, and no comments.
(If desired, a configuration may be commented upon with any
other file, such as a free-form README.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TARGET
SELECTION</b> <br>
This set of configuration files identifies where pmmgr
should search for pmcd instances, how to uniquely identify
them, and where state such as log files should be kept for
each. Ideally, a persistent &amp; unique host-id string is
computed for each potential target pmcd from specified
metric values. This host-id is also used as a subdirectory
name for locating daemon data. <br>
hostid&minus;metrics</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains one or more
lines of metric specifications in the format accepted by
<i>pmParseMetricSpec</i>. Metrics without instance
specifiers mean all instances of that metric. These are used
to generate the <i>unique</i> host-id string for each pmcd
server that pmmgr discovers. Upon discovery, all the
metrics/instances named are queried, string values fetched,
and normalized/concatenated into a single hyphenated
printable string. The default is the single metric
<b>pmcd.hostname</b>, which is sufficient if all the hosts
discovered have unique hostname(2). If they don&rsquo;t, you
should add other pcp metric specifications to set them apart
at your site. The more you add, the longer the host-id
string, but the more likely that accidental duplication is
prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">However, it may
be desirable for a host-id to also be <i>persistent</i>, so
that if the target host goes offline and later returns, the
new host-id matches the previous one, because then old and
new histories can be joined. This argues against using
metrics whose values vary from boot to boot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Some candidate
metrics to consider: <i>network.interface.hw_addr</i>,
<i>network.interface.inet_addr[&quot;eth0&quot;]</i>,
<i>network.interface.ipv6_addr</i>,
<i>kernel.uname.nodename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">log&minus;directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains the path of
a directory beneath which the per-host-id subdirectories are
to be created by pmmgr. If it is not a full path, it is
implicitly relative to the configuration directory itself.
The default is <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmmgr/</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">target&minus;host</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains one or more
lines containing pmcd host specifications, as described on
the <i>PCPintro</i>(1) man page. Each poll interval, pmmgr
will attempt to make a brief <i>pmNewContext</i> connection
to the host to check liveness. It is not a problem if more
than one specification for the same host is listed, because
the host-id processing eliminates duplicates, and chooses an
arbitrary specification among them. The default is to target
pmcd at <b>local:</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">target&minus;discovery</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains one or more
lines containing specifications for the
<i>pmDiscoverServices</i> PMAPI call, each of which may map
onto a fluctuating set of local or remote pmcd servers. Each
poll interval, pmmgr will attempt to rerun discovery with
all of the given specifications. Again, it is not a problem
if more than one specification matches the same actual pmcd:
one confirmed access path is arbitrarily selected. The
default is to do <b>no discovery</b>. Consider including
<i>avahi,timeout=5</i> to rely in pmcd self-announcements on
the local network (searching for up to five seconds each
time). Consider including <i>probe=192.168.1.0/24</i> to
quickly scan the given IP address range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subtarget&minus;containers</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, pmmgr will
scan each host that is found for running containers. For
each running container, it will create independent
subtargets for running requested daemons. The host-id string
for these subtargets is the host&rsquo;s host-id string,
followed by a double-hyphen, then the full unique container
instance-name string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">target&minus;threads</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file contains a limit on
the number of concurrent threads that analyze potential
target pmcds for their hostids and/or containers. The
default is <b>a few dozen threads per CPU core</b>, if
known. Set this to zero if remote pmcds should be analyzed
sequentially. A small number of threads is not a good idea
if any potential target pmcds are unreachable, since
$PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT may be several seconds long each.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">log&minus;subdirectory&minus;gc</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This file may contain a time
interval specification as per the <i>PCPintro</i> man page.
All subdirectories of the log&minus;directory are presumed
to contain data for pmmgr-monitored servers. Those that have
not been touched (in the <b>stat/mtime</b> sense) in at
least that long, and not associated with a currently
monitored target, are deleted entirely. This value should be
longer than the longest interval that pmmgr normally
recreates archives (such as due to pmmgr restarts, and
<b>pmlogmerge</b> intervals). The default value is
<b>90days</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PMLOGGER
CONFIGURATION</b> <br>
This group of configuration options controls a
<b>pmlogger</b> daemon for each host. This may include
generating its configuration, and managing its archives.
<br>
pmlogger</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If and only if this file
exists, pmmgr will maintain a <b>pmlogger</b> daemon for
each targeted host. This file contains one line of
additional space-separated options for the pmie daemon.
(pmmgr already adds &minus;h, &minus;f, &minus;r, &minus;l,
and perhaps &minus;c.) The default is to maintain <b>no
pmlogger</b> (and no other configuration in this section is
processed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogconf</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If and only if this file
exists, pmmgr will run <b>pmlogconf</b> to generate a
configuration file for each target pmcd. The file contains
one line of space-separated additional options for the
pmlogconf program. pmlogconf&rsquo;s generated output file
will be stored under the log&minus;directory/hostid
subdirectory. (pmmgr already adds &minus;c, &minus;r, and
&minus;h.) The default is <b>no pmlogconf</b>, so instead,
the pmlogger file above should probably contain a &minus;c
option, to specify a fixed pmlogger configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ARCHIVE LOG
MANAGEMENT</b> <br>
Default pmlogger configurations can collect tens of
megabytes of data per day (possibly split into multiple
archives), per target host. If your disk space is less than
infinite, or archive-splitting unwieldy, this should be
managed. In the default, unmanaged case, the system
administrator is responsible for managing the individual
<i>archive-*</i> files from the per-host logging
subdirectories. pmmgr offers several other options, each
representing different performance / usability
tradeoffs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ARCHIVE LOG
MANAGEMENT - pmlogmerge</b> <br>
This style of archive log management regularly creates a
single merged archive from prior archives for each target
host, in effect lopping off old data and appending the new.
A single merged archive can be relatively large (defaults to
approximately 100-400 MB per host), and puts a corresponding
I/O load on storage, but is most convenient for a detailed
long-timeframe analysis. Once pmlogger is restarted, it
always creates a new archive, so in the steady state, there
will be one merged archive of recent history, and one
current archive being written-to by pmlogger. <br>
pmlogmerge</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, pmmgr will
run <b>pmlogextract</b> to periodically merge together
preexisting log archives for each target pmcd into a single
large one. Then, the preexisting log archives are deleted
(including any prior merged ones). This configuration file
may contain a time interval specification as per the
<i>PCPintro</i> man page, representing the period after
which pmlogger should be temporarily stopped, and archives
merged. It represents the maximum amount of time that the
merged archive <i>lags</i> the present time. The default is
<b>24hours</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogmerge&minus;granular</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, pmmgr will
merge only a subset of preexisting log archives into the new
one, instead of all of them, so as to approximate a
granular, aligned set of merged archives. The subset chosen
corresponds to the previous time interval specified by the
<i>pmlogmerge</i> control file. The default is <b>no
granularity</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogmerge&minus;rewrite</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, pmmgr will
run <b>pmlogrewrite -i</b> (plus any other options listed in
this file) on each input archive before merging it. This
will naturally require more disk I/O. The default is <b>no
rewriting</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogmerge&minus;retain</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">pmmgr reduces/deletes any
original-resolution archives after a time period specified
by this file, as measured by the file mtime. The period will
also be passed to pmlogextract as a negative parameter to
&minus;S. The default is <b>14days</b>. To store archives
indefinitely, set this to a large quantity like
&quot;99999weeks&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogreduce</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, then prior
to removing archives that expire past the
<i>pmlogmerge&minus;retain</i> period, they are processed
with <i>pmlogreduce</i> to create reduced archives (named
<b>reduced-*</b>). If the file contains space-separated
options, they are passed onto pmlogreduce. (By default,
pmlogreduce downsamples to a 600-second interval.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmlogreduce&minus;retain</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, then
reduced archives (identified by the <b>reduced-*</b>
pattern) are deleted after a time period specified by this
file, as measured from the file mtime. Since this time is
likely that of the pmlogreduce run, the total retention time
will be approximately the pmlogmerge&minus;retain time
<b>plus</b> the pmlogreduce&minus;retain time. The default
is <b>90days</b>. To store reduced archives indefinitely,
set this to a large quantity like
&quot;99999weeks&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PMIE
CONFIGURATION</b> <br>
This group of configuration options controls a <b>pmie</b>
daemon for each host. This may include generating a custom
configuration.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>pmie</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a
<b>pmie</b> daemon for each targeted pmcd. This file
contains one line of additional space-separated options for
the pmie daemon. (pmmgr already adds &minus;h, &minus;f,
&minus;l, and perhaps &minus;c.) The default is to maintain
<b>no pmie</b> (and no other configuration in this section
is processed).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pmieconf</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If and only if this file
exists, pmmgr will run <b>pmieconf</b> to generate a
configuration file for each target pmcd. The file contains
one line of space-separated additional options for the
pmieconf program. pmieconf&rsquo;s generated output file
will be stored under the log&minus;directory/hostid
subdirectory. (pmmgr already adds &minus;F, &minus;c, and
&minus;f.) The default is <b>no pmieconf</b>, so instead,
the pmie file above should probably contain a &minus;c
option, to specify a fixed pmie configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MONITOR
DAEMON MANAGEMENT</b> <br>
In addition to pmlogger and pmie, pmmgr may be used to
invoke arbitrary pcp client programs for each target pmcd.
This can enable automated invocation of reporting or
relaying tools, such as <b>pmrep</b> or <b>pcp2graphite</b>,
without needing a specialized system service. <br>
monitor</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this file exists, then for
each line in this file, a new background process will be
invoked. (It is restarted if it exits.) The line specifies
the beginning of the command line (including the program
name); pmmgr appends a &minus;h HOSTSPEC, and arranges to
collect the standard output and standard error into separate
<b>monitor-NN.out</b> and <b>monitor-NN.err</b> files under
the log directory.</p>
