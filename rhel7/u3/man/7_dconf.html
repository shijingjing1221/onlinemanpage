<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf &minus; A
configuration systen</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf is a
simple key/value storage system that is heavily optimised
for reading. This makes it an ideal system for storing user
preferences (which are read 1000s of times for each time the
user changes one). It was created with this usecase in
mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All preferences
are stored in a single large binary file. Layering of
preferences is possible using multiple files (ie: for site
defaults). Lock&minus;down is also supported. The binary
file for the defaults can optionally be compiled from a set
of plain text keyfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf has a
partial client/server architecture. It uses D&minus;Bus. The
server is only involved in writes (and is not activated in
the user session until the user modifies a preference). The
service is stateless and can exit freely at any time (and is
therefore robust against crashes). The list of paths that
each process is watching is stored within the D&minus;Bus
daemon itself (as D&minus;Bus signal match rules).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads are
performed by direct access (via mmap) to the on&minus;disk
database which is essentially a hashtable. For this reason,
dconf reads typically involve zero system calls and are
comparable to a hashtable lookup in terms of speed.
Practically speaking, in simple non&minus;layered setups,
dconf is less than 10 times slower than GHashTable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writes are
assumed only to happen in response to explicit user
interaction (like clicking on a checkbox in a preferences
dialog) and are therefore not optimised at all. On some file
systems, dconf&minus;service will call fsync() for every
write, which can introduce a latency of up to 100ms. This
latency is hidden by the client libraries through a clever
&quot;fast&quot; mechanism that records the outstanding
changes locally (so they can be read back immediately) until
the service signals that a write has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The binary
database format that dconf uses by default is not suitable
for use on NFS, where mmap does not work well. To handle
this common use case, dconf can be configured to place its
binary database in <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b> (which is
guaranteed to be local, but non&minus;persistent) and
synchronize it with a plain text keyfile in the users home
directory.</p>

<h2>PROFILES
<a name="PROFILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A profile is a
list of configuration databases that dconf consults to find
the value for a key. The user's personal database always
takes the highest priority, followed by the system databases
in the order prescribed by the profile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On startup,
dconf consults the <b>DCONF_PROFILE</b> environment
variable. If set, dconf will attempt to open the named
profile, aborting if that fails. If the environment variable
is not set, it will attempt to open the profile named
&quot;user&quot; and if that fails, it will fall back to an
internal hard&minus;wired configuration. dconf stores its
profiles in text files. <b>DCONF_PROFILE</b> can specify a
relative path to a file in /etc/dconf/profile/, or an
absolute path (such as in a user's home directory). The
profile name can only use alphanumeric characters or
'_'.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A profile file
might look like the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">user&minus;db:user
<br>
system&minus;db:local <br>
system&minus;db:site</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line in a
profile specifies one dconf database. The first line
indicates the database used to write changes, and the
remaining lines indicate read&minus;only databases. (The
first line should specify a user&minus;db or
service&minus;db, so that users can actually make
configuration changes.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;user&minus;db&quot; line specifies a user database.
These databases are found in <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>/dconf/.
The name of the file to open in that directory is exactly as
it is written in the profile. This file is expected to be in
the binary dconf database format. Note that
<b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> cannot be set/modified per terminal
or session, because then the writer and reader would be
working on different DBs (the writer is started by DBus and
cannot see that variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;service&minus;db&quot; line instructs dconf to place
the binary database file for the user database in
<b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>. Since this location is not
persistent, the rest of the line instructs dconf how to
store the database persistently. A typical line is
service&minus;db:keyfile/user, which tells dconf to
synchronize the binary database with a plain text keyfile in
<b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>/dconf/user.txt. The synchronization
is bi&minus;directional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;system&minus;db&quot; line specifies a system
database. These databases are found in /etc/dconf/db/.
Again, the name of the file to open in that directory is
exactly as it is written in the profile and the file is
expected to be in the dconf database format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>DCONF_PROFILE</b> environment variable is unset and the
&quot;user&quot; profile can not be opened, then the effect
is as if the profile was specified by this file:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">user&minus;db:user</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That is, the
user's personal database is consulted and there are no
system settings.</p>

<h2>KEY FILES
<a name="KEY FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To facilitate
system configuration with a text editor, dconf can populate
databases from plain text keyfiles. For any given system
database, keyfiles can be placed into the
/etc/dconf/db/<i>database</i>.d/ directory. The keyfiles
contain groups of settings as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Some useful
default settings for our site</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[system/proxy/http]
<br>
host='172.16.0.1' <br>
enabled=true</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[org/gnome/desktop/background]
<br>

picture&minus;uri='file:///usr/local/rupert&minus;corp/company&minus;wallpaper.jpeg'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After changing
keyfiles, the database needs to be updated with the
<b>dconf</b>(1) tool.</p>

<h2>LOCKS
<a name="LOCKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
databases can contain 'locks' for keys. If a lock for a
particular key or subpath is installed into a database then
no database listed above that one in the profile will be
able to modify any of the affected settings. This can be
used to enforce mandatory settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To add locks to
a database, place text files in the
/etc/dconf/db/<i>database</i>.d/locks directory, where
<i>database</i> is the name of a system database, as
specified in the profile. The files contain list of keys to
lock, on per line. Lines starting with a # are ignored. Here
is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># prevent
changes to the company wallpaper <br>
/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture&minus;uri</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After changing
locks, the database needs to be updated with the
<b>dconf</b>(1) tool.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf mostly
targets Free Software operating systems. It will
theoretically run on Mac OS but there isn't much point to
that (since Mac OS applications want to store preferences in
plist files). It is not possible to use dconf on Windows
because of the inability to rename over a file that's still
in use (which is what the dconf&minus;service does on every
write).</p>

<h2>API STABILITY
<a name="API STABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dconf API
is not particularly friendly, and is not guaranteed to be
stable. Because of this and the lack of portability, you
almost certainly want to use some sort of wrapper API around
it. The wrapper API used by GTK+ and GNOME applications is
<b><font color="#0000FF">GSettings</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">, which is included as part of GLib.
GSettings has backends for Windows (using the registry) and
Mac OS (using property lists) as well as its dconf backend
and is the proper API to use for graphical
applications.</font></p>
