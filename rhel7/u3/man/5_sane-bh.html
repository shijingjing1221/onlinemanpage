<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sane&minus;bh
&minus; SANE backend for Bell+Howell Copiscan II series
document scanners</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sane&minus;bh</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Bell+Howell
Copiscan II series document scanners. The Copiscan II 6338
has been the primary scanner model used during development
and testing, but since the programming interface for the
entire series is consistent the backend should work for the
following scanner models.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">COPISCAN II
6338 Duplex Scanner with ACE <br>
COPISCAN II 2135 Simplex Scanner <br>
COPISCAN II 2137(A) Simplex Scanner (with ACE) <br>
COPISCAN II 2138A Simplex Scanner with ACE <br>
COPISCAN II 3238 Simplex Scanner <br>
COPISCAN II 3338(A) Simplex Scanner (with ACE)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
Bell+Howell scanner and are able to test it with this
backend, please contact
<i>sane&minus;devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</i> with the
model number and testing results. Have a look at
http://www.sane&minus;project.org/mailing&minus;lists.html
concerning subscription to sane&minus;devel. Additionally,
the author is curious as to the likelihood of using this
backend with the newer 4000 and 8000 series scanners. If you
have such a beast, please let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Bell+Howell
Copiscan II series document scanners are high volume, high
throughput scanners designed for document scanning
applications. As such, they are lineart/grayscale scanners
supporting a fixed number of fairly low resolutions (e.g.
200/240/300dpi). However, they do have a number of
interesting and useful features suited to needs of document
imaging applications. This backend attempts to support as
many of these features as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
technical reference used in writing this backend is the
<b>Bell and Howell Copiscan II Remote SCSI Controller (RSC)
OEM Technical Manual Version 1.5.</b> The Linux SCSI
programming HOWTO, the SANE API documentation, and SANE
source code were also extremely valuable resources.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The latest
backend release, additional information and helpful hints
are available from the backend homepage:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>http://www.martoneconsulting.com/sane&minus;bh.html</b></p>

<h2>DEVICE NAMES
<a name="DEVICE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
expects device names of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>special</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>special</i> is the path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the
special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
takes a format such as <i>/dev/sga</i> or <i>/dev/sg0</i>,
for example. See sane&minus;scsi(5) for details.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the <i>bh.conf</i> file is a list of device names that
correspond to Bell+Howell scanners. See sane&minus;scsi(5)
on details of what constitutes a valid device name.
Additionally, options can be specified; these lines begin
with the word &quot;option&quot;. Each option is described
in detail below. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options can be specified in the <i>bh.conf</i> file. <b><br>
disable&minus;optional&minus;frames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option prevents the
backend from sending any optional frames. This option may be
useful when dealing with frontends which do not support
these optional frames. When this option is in effect, the
data is sent in a SANE_FRAME_GRAY frame. The optional frames
sent by this backend are: SANE_FRAME_G31D, SANE_FRAME_G32D,
SANE_FRAME_G42D and SANE_FRAME_TEXT. These frames are
generated based on the compression and barcode options.
These frames are never sent in preview mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fake&minus;inquiry</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is used for
debugging purposes and its use is not encouraged.
Essentially, it allows the backend to initialize in the
absence of a scanner. This is useful for development and not
much else. This option must be specified earlier in the
configuration file than the devices which are to be
&quot;faked&quot;.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/etc/sane.d/bh.conf</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The backend configuration file
(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;bh.a</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The static library implementing
this backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;bh.so</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&lsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&lsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_DEBUG_BH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
255 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<h2>SUPPORTED FEATURES
<a name="SUPPORTED FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ADF
support</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With document scanners,
automatic document feeder (ADF) support is a key feature.
The backend supports the ADF by default and returns
<b>SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS</b> when the out-of-paper condition
is detected. The SANE frontend <b>scanadf</b> is a command
line frontend that supports multi-page scans. It has been
used successfully with this backend. The SANE frontend
<b>xsane</b> is an improved GUI frontend by Oliver Rauch.
Support for multi-page scans is included in xsane version
0.35 and above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Duplex scanning</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Some models, such as the
COPISCAN II 6338, support duplex scanning. That is, they
scan both sides of the document during a single pass through
the scanner (the scanner has two cameras). This backend
supports duplex scanning (with the
<b>&minus;&minus;duplex</b> option). The front and back page
images are delivered consecutively as if they were
separately scanned pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Hardware compression</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The scanner is capable of
compressing the data into several industry standard formats
(CCITT G3, CCITT G3-2D, CCITT G4). This results in increased
performance as less data is passed from the scanner to the
host over the SCSI bus. The backend supports these
compression formats via the <b>&minus;&minus;g31d,
&minus;&minus;g32d, &minus;&minus;g42d</b> options,
respectively. Many SANE frontends are not equipped to deal
with these formats, however. The SANE frontend
<b>scanadf</b> supports these optional frame formats. The
compressed image data is written directly to a file and can
then be processed by a scan-script using the
<b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;script</b> option. Examples of
this are given on the scanadf homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Automatic Border
Detection</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The scanner can automatically
detect the paper size and adjust the scanning window
geometry appropriately. The backend supports this useful
feature with the <b>&minus;&minus;autoborder</b> option. It
is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Batch Mode Scanning</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The batch scan mode allows for
maximum throughput. The Set Window parameters must remain
constant during the entire batch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Icon Generation</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The Icon function generates a
thumbnail of the full page image, that can be transferred as
if it were a separate page. This allows the host to quickly
display a thumbnail representation during the scanning
operation. Perhaps this would be a great way of implementing
a preview scan, but since a normal scan is so quick, it
might not be worth the trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Multiple Sections</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Multiple sections (scanning
sub-windows) can be defined for the front and back pages.
Each section can have different characteristics (e.g.
geometry, compression). The sections are returned as if they
were separately scanned images. Additionally sections can be
used to greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the
barcode/patchcode decoding process by limiting the search
area to a small subset of the page. Most Copiscan II series
scanners support up to 8 user-defined sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Support Barcode/Patchcode
Decoding</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The RSC unit can recognize Bar
and Patch Codes of various types embedded in the scanned
image. The codes are decoded and the data is returned to the
frontend as a text frame. The text is encoded in xml and
contains a great deal of information about the decoded data
such as the location where it was found, its orientation,
and the time it took to find. Further information on the
content of this text frame as well as some barcode decoding
examples can be found on the backend homepage.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Decoding a
single barcode type per scan</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The RSC unit can search for up
to six different barcode types at a time. While the code
generally supports this as well, the
<b>&minus;&minus;barcode&minus;search&minus;bar</b> option
only allows the user to specify a single barcode type.
Perhaps another option which allows a comma separated list
of barcode type codes could be added to address this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scanning a fixed number of
pages in batch mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The separation of front and
back end functionality in SANE presents a problem in
supporting the &rsquo;cancel batch&rsquo; functionality in
the scanner. In batch mode, the scanner is always a page
ahead of the host. The host, knowing ahead of time which
page will be the last, can cancel batch mode prior to
initiating the last scan command. Currently, there is no
mechanism available for the frontend to pass this knowledge
to the backend. If batch mode is enabled and the
&minus;&minus;end&minus;count terminates a scanadf session,
an extra page will be pulled through the scanner, but is
neither read nor delivered to the frontend. The issue can be
avoided by specifying &minus;&minus;batch=no when scanning a
fixed number of pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Revision 1.2 Patch
detector</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">There is an enhanced patchcode
detection algorithm available in the RSC with revision 1.2
or higher that is faster and more reliable than the standard
Bar/Patch code decoder. This is not currently supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily
barcodes are searched in the entire image. However, when you
specify sections all barcode searching is done within the
