&minus; introduction to the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) is a toolkit designed for monitoring and
managing system-level performance. These services are
distributed and scalable to accommodate the most complex
system configurations and performance problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCP supports
many different platforms, including (but not limited to)
Linux, MacOSX, Solaris and Windows. From a high-level PCP
can be considered to contain two classes of software
utility: <i><br>
PCP Collectors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">These are the parts of PCP that
collect and extract performance data from various sources,
e.g. the operating system kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>PCP Monitors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">These are the parts of PCP that
display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have
the <i>PCP Collector</i> installed. Many monitor tools are
available as part of the core PCP release, while other
(typically graphical) monitoring tools are available
separately in the PCP GUI package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
entry describes the high-level features and options common
to most PCP utilities available on all platforms.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCP
architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool
may be executing remotely. On the host (or hosts) being
monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the
kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web
server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting
performance measurements from that domain. All PMDAs are
controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(<b>pmcd</b>(1)) on the same host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Client
applications (the monitoring tools) connect to
<b>pmcd</b>(1), which acts as a router for requests, by
forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning
the responses to the clients. Clients may also access
performance data from sets of PCP archives (created using
<b>pmlogger</b>(1)) for retrospective analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Security
philosophy</b> <br>
PCP redistributes a wealth of performance information within
a host and across its networks. The following security
philosophy underlies the setting of several <i>defaults</i>
that control how much information is sent and received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
information exposed by PMCD about a host is approximately of
the same level of confidentiality as available to a
completely unprivileged user on that host. So, performance
data that is available to be <i>read</i> completely freely
on a machine may be made available by PMCD to the
network.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
host running PMCD and its network is <i>not</i> assumed to
run only friendly applications. Therefore, <i>write</i> type
operations, including from the local host, are not permitted
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These defaults
may be overridden (expanded or reduced) in several ways,
including by specifying network ACLs in <b>pmcd.conf</b>,
activating non-default PMDAs, or by using PMCD connections
that pass user credentials. For example, some PMDAs
automatically provide greater information for particular
credentialed users or groups.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Applications</b>
<br>
The following performance monitoring applications are
primarily console based, typically run directly from the
command line, and are just a small subset of the tools
available as part of the base PCP package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each tool or
command is documented completely in its own reference
page.</p>

<h2>COMMON COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
<a name="COMMON COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a set
of common command line arguments that are used consistently
by most PCP tools. <b><br>
&minus;a</b> <i>archive</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Performance metric information
is retrospectively retrieved from the set of Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) archives identified by <i>archive</i>,
previously generated by <b>pmlogger</b>(1).<b>See
pcp-archive</b>(5) for format documentation. The
<b>&minus;a</b> and <b>&minus;h</b> options are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>archive</i>
is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the
name of a directory containing one or more archives, the
base name common to all of the physical files created by an
instance of <b>pmlogger</b>(1), or any one of the physical
files, e.g. <i>/path/to/myarchives</i> (directory) or
<i>myarchive</i> (base name) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.meta</b>
(the metadata file) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.index</b> (the
temporal index) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0</b> (the first data
volume of <i>archive</i>) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.bz2</b>
or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.bz</b> (the first data volume
compressed with <b>bzip2</b>(1)) or
<i>myarchive</i><b>.0.gz</b> or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.Z</b>
or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.z</b> (the first data volume
compressed with <b>gzip</b>(1)), <i>myarchive</i><b>.1</b>
or <i>myarchive</i><b>.3.bz2</b> or
<i>myarchive</i><b>.42.gz</b> etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b>
<i>hostname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Unless directed to another host
by the <b>&minus;h</b> option, or to a set of archives by
the <b>&minus;a</b> option, the source of performance
metrics will be the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(PMCD) on the local host. Refer to the <b>PMCD HOST
SPECIFICATION</b> section later for further details on the
many options available when forming the <i>hostname</i>
specification, as well as a detailed description of the
default local host connection. The <b>&minus;a</b> and
<b>&minus;h</b> options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>samples</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The argument <i>samples</i>
defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported.
If <i>samples</i> is 0 or <b>&minus;s</b> is not specified,
the application will sample and report continuously (in real
time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives (in
archive mode).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;z</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
identified via either the <b>&minus;h</b> or <b>&minus;a</b>
options.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Z</b>
<i>timezone</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, applications report
the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where the application is executed. The
<b>&minus;Z</b> option changes the timezone to
<i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment variable
<b>TZ</b> as described in <b>environ</b>(7).</p>

<h2>INTERVAL SPECIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT
<a name="INTERVAL SPECIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most PCP tools
operate with periodic sampling or reporting, and the
<b>&minus;t</b> and <b>&minus;A</b> options may be used to
control the duration of the sample interval and the
alignment of the sample times. <b><br>
&minus;t</b> <i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the update or reporting
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>interval</i> argument is specified as a sequence of one
or more elements of the form</p>


<p style="margin-left:37%;"><i>number</i>[<i>units</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>number</i> is an
integer or floating point constant (parsed using
<b>strtod</b>(3)) and the optional <i>units</i> is one of:
<b>seconds</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>secs</b>, <b>sec</b>,
<b>s</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>minute</b>, <b>mins</b>,
<b>min</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>hours</b>, <b>hour</b>, <b>h</b>,
<b>days</b>, <b>day</b> and <b>d</b>. If the <i>unit</i> is
empty, <b>second</b> is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of the above
is also acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Spaces anywhere
in the <i>interval</i> are ignored, so <b>4 days 6 hours 30
minutes</b>, <b>4day6hour30min</b>, <b>4d6h30m</b> and
<b>4d6.5h</b> are all equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
specifications are additive, e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;<b>1hour
15mins 30secs</b>&rsquo;&rsquo; is interpreted as
3600+900+30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A</b>
<i>align</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default samples are not
necessarily aligned on any natural unit of time. The
<b>&minus;A</b> option may be used to force the initial
sample to be aligned on the boundary of a natural time unit.
For example <b>&minus;A 1sec</b>, <b>&minus;A 30min</b> and
<b>-A 1hour</b> specify alignment on whole seconds, half and
whole hours respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>align</i> argument follows the syntax for an
<i>interval</i> argument described above for the
<b>&minus;t</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
alignment occurs by advancing the time as required, and that
<b>&minus;A</b> acts as a modifier to advance both the start
of the time window (see the next section) and the origin
time (if the <b>&minus;O</b> option is specified).</p>

<h2>TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION
<a name="TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many PCP tools
are designed to operate in some time window of interest,
e.g. to define a termination time for real-time monitoring
or to define a start and end time within a set of PCP
archive logs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the absence
of the <b>&minus;O</b> and <b>&minus;A</b> options to
specify an initial sample time origin and time alignment
(see above), the PCP application will retrieve the first
sample at the start of the time window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options may be used to specify a time window of interest.
<b><br>
&minus;S</b> <i>starttime</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default the time window
commences immediately in real-time mode, or coincides with
time at the start of the set of PCP archive logs in archive
mode. The <b>&minus;S</b> option may be used to specify a
later time for the start of the time window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>starttime</i> parameter may be given in one of three
forms (<i>interval</i> is the same as for the
<b>&minus;t</b> option as described above, <i>datetime</i>
is described below): <i><br>
interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify an offset from the
current time (in real-time mode) or the beginning of a set
of PCP archives (in archive mode) simply specify the
interval of time as the argument. For example <b>&minus;S
30min</b> will set the start of the time window to be
exactly 30 minutes from now in real-time mode, or exactly 30
minutes from the start of a set of PCP archives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;<i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify an offset from the
end of a set of PCP archive logs, prefix the <i>interval</i>
argument with a minus sign. In this case, the start of the
time window precedes the time at the end of the set of
archives by the given interval. For example <b>&minus;S
&minus;1hour</b> will set the start of the time window to be
exactly one hour before the time of the last sample in a set
of PCP archive logs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">@<i>datetime</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify the calendar date
and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the
start of the time window, use the datetime syntax preceded
by an at sign. Refer to the datetime description below for
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;T</b>
<i>endtime</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default the end of the time
window is unbounded (in real-time mode) or aligned with the
time at the end of a set of PCP archive logs (in archive
mode). The <b>&minus;T</b> option may be used to specify an
earlier time for the end of the time window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>endtime</i> parameter may be given in one of three forms
(<i>interval</i> is the same as for the <b>&minus;t</b>
option as described above, <i>datetime</i> is described
below): <i><br>
interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify an offset from the
start of the time window simply use the interval of time as
the argument. For example <b>&minus;T 2h30m</b> will set the
end of the time window to be 2 hours and 30 minutes after
the start of the time window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&minus;<i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify an offset back from
the time at the end of a set of PCP archive logs, prefix the
<i>interval</i> argument with a minus sign. For example
<b>&minus;T &minus;90m</b> will set the end of the time
window to be 90 minutes before the time of the last sample
in a set of PCP archive logs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">@<i>datetime</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To specify the calendar date
and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the end
of the time window, use the datetime syntax preceded by an
at sign. Refer to the datetime description below for
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;O</b>
<i>origin</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default samples are fetched
from the start of the time window (see description of
<b>&minus;S</b> option) to the end of the time window (see
description of <b>&minus;T</b> option). The <b>&minus;O</b>
option allows the specification of an origin within the time
window to be used as the initial sample time. This is useful
for interactive use of a PCP tool with the <b>pmtime</b>(1)
VCR replay facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>origin</i> argument accepted by <b>&minus;O</b> conforms
to the same syntax and semantics as the <i>starttime</i>
argument for the <b>&minus;T</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example
<b>&minus;O -0</b> specifies that the initial position
should be at the end of the time window; this is most useful
when wishing to replay &lsquo;&lsquo;backwards&rsquo;&rsquo;
within the time window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>datetime</i> argument for the <b>&minus;O</b>,
<b>&minus;S</b> and <b>&minus;T</b> options consists of:
<b><br>
date time zone day relative</b> <br>
A date can be one of: YY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, DD Month YYYY, or
Month DD YYYY. A time can be one of: HH:MM:SS, HH:MM. HH:MM
can use either the 12 hour (via an am or pm suffix) or 24
hour convention. A day of the week can be a spelled out day
of the week, optionally preceded by an ordinal number such
as second tuesday. A zone is a time zone value as specified
by the <b>tzselect(1)</b> command. A relative time can be a
time unit that is: preceded by a cardinal number such as 1
year or 2 months, preceded by one of the time words this or
last, or succeeded by the time word ago. A relative time can
also be one of the time words: yesterday, today, tomorrow,
now. Examples of datetime strings are: <b>1996-03-04
13:07:47 EST Mon</b>, <b>1996-03-05 14:07:47 EST -1hour</b>,
<b>Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996</b>, <b>Mar 4 1996</b>, <b>Mar
4</b>, <b>Mar</b>, <b>13:07:50</b> or <b>13:08</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For any missing
low order fields, the default value of 0 is assumed for
hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month and Jan
for months. Hence, the following are equivalent: <b>&minus;S
&rsquo;@ Mar 1996&rsquo;</b> and <b>&minus;S &rsquo;@ Mar 1
00:00:00 1996&rsquo;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any high
order fields are missing, they are filled in by starting
with the year, month and day from the current time
(real-time mode) or the time at the beginning of the set of
PCP archive logs (archive mode) and advancing the time until
it matches the fields that are specified. So, for example if
the time window starts by default at &lsquo;&lsquo;Mon Mar 4
13:07:47 1996&rsquo;&rsquo;, then <b>&minus;S @13:10</b>
corresponds to 13:10:00 on Mon Mar 4, 1996, while
<b>&minus;S @10:00</b> corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue Mar 5,
1996 (note this is the following day).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For greater
precision than afforded by <b>datetime</b>(3), the seconds
component may be a floating point number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a timezone
is not included in a <i>datetime</i> then there ares several
interpretations available depending on the other command
line options used. The default is to use the local timezone
on the system where the PCP tool is being run. A
<b>&minus;Z</b> option specifies an explicit timezone, else
a <b>&minus;z</b> option changes the timezone to the local
timezone at the host that is the source of the performance
metrics.</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE METRICS &minus; NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS
<a name="PERFORMANCE METRICS &minus; NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
performance metric names supported by PCP on most platforms
ranges from many hundreds to several thousand. The PCP
libraries and applications use an internal identification
scheme that unambiguously associates a single integer with
each known performance metric. This integer is known as the
Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID. Although not a
requirement, PMIDs tend to have global consistency across
all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has
the same PMID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For all users
and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be
inappropriate (e.g. this would limit the range of accessible
metrics, make the code hard to maintain, force the user
interface to be particularly baroque, etc.). Hence a
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is used to provide
external names and a hierarchic classification for
performance metrics. A PMNS is represented as a tree, with
each node having a label, a pointer to either a PMID (for
leaf nodes) or a set of descendent nodes in the PMNS (for
non-leaf nodes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A node label
must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by zero or
more characters drawn from the alphabetics, the digits and
character `_&acute; (underscore). For alphabetic characters
in a node label, upper and lower case are distinguished.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By convention,
the name of a performance metric is constructed by
concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS
from the root node to a leaf node, with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo; as a separator. The root node
in the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label
associated with one of the descendent nodes below the root
node of the PMNS, e.g. <i>kernel.percpu.syscall</i>.
Typically (although this is not a requirement) there would
be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS. For example
<i>kernel.all.cpu.idle</i> and <i>disk.dev.read</i> are the
unique names for two distinct performance metrics, each with
a unique PMID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Groups of
related PMIDs may be named by naming a non-leaf node in the
PMNS tree, e.g. <i>disk</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
local PMNS used by <b>pmcd</b> is located at
<b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</b> however the environment
variable <b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b> may be set to the full pathname
of a different PMNS which will then be used as the default
local PMNS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
applications do not use the local PMNS directly, but rather
import parts of the PMNS as required from the same place
that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from
<b>pmcd</b>(1) for live monitoring or from a set of PCP
archives for retrospective monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To explore the
PMNS use <b>pminfo</b>(1), or if the PCP GUI package is
installed the New Chart and Metric Search windows within
<b>pmchart</b>(1).</p>

<h2>PERFORMANCE METRIC SPECIFICATIONS
<a name="PERFORMANCE METRIC SPECIFICATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line
options, metric specifications adhere to the following
syntax rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the source
of performance metrics is real-time from <b>pmcd</b>(1) then
the accepted syntax is <i><br>

host</i><b>:</b><i>metric</i><b>[</b><i>instance1</i><b>,</b><i>instance2</i><b>,</b>...<b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the source
of performance metrics is a set of PCP archive logs then the

<h2>SECURE PMCD CONNECTIONS
<a name="SECURE PMCD CONNECTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since PCP
version 3.6.11, a monitor can explicitly request a secure
connection to a collector host running <b>pmcd</b>(1) or
<b>pmproxy</b>(1) using the PM_CTXFLAG_SECURE context flag.
If the PCP Collector host supports this feature - refer to
the pmcd.feature.secure metric for confirmation of this - a
TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer)
connection can be established which uses public key
cryptography and related techniques. These features aim to
prevent eavesdropping and data tampering from a malicious
third party, as well as providing server-side authentication
(confident identification of a server by a client) which can
be used to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A secure
<b>pmcd</b> connection requires use of certificate-based
authentication. The security features offered by <b>pmcd</b>
and <b>pmproxy</b> are implemented using the Network
Security Services (NSS) APIs and utilities. The NSS
<b>certutil</b> tool can be used to create certificates
suitable for establishing trust between PCP monitor and
collector hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A complete
description is beyond the scope of this document, refer to
the <b>PCP ENVIRONMENT</b>, <b>FILES</b> and <b>SEE ALSO</b>
sections for detailed information. This includes links to
tutorials on the steps involved in setting up the available
security features.</p>

<h2>PMCD HOST SPECIFICATION
<a name="PMCD HOST SPECIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the absence
of an explicit host name specification, most tools will
default to the local host in live update mode. In PCP
releases since 3.8.4 onward, this results in an efficient
local protocol being selected &minus; typically a Unix
domain socket. If this option is used (which can also be
explicitly requested via the <i>unix:</i> host specification
described below), it is important to note that all
connections will be automatically authenticated. In other
words, the credentials of the user invoking a client tool
will automatically be made available to <b>pmcd</b>(1) and
all of its PMDAs, on the users behalf, such that results can
be customized to the privilege levels of individual
users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Names of remote
hosts running the <b>pmcd</b>(1) daemon can of course also
be provided to request a remote host be used. The most basic
form of <b>pmcd</b> host specification is a simple host
name, possibly including the domain name if necessary.
However, this can be extended in a number of ways to further
refine attributes of the connection made to <b>pmcd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>pmcd</b>
port number and also optional <b>pmproxy</b>(1) hostname and
its port number, can be given as part of the host
specification, since PCP version 3.0. These supersede (and
override) the old-style PMCD_PORT, PMPROXY_HOST and
PMPROXY_PORT environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
are valid hostname specifications that specify connections
to <b>pmcd</b> on host <i>nas1.servers.com</i> with/without
a list of ports, with/without a <b>pmproxy</b>(1) connection
through a firewall, and with IPv6 and IPv4 addresses as
shown.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">$ pcp &minus;h nas1.servers.com:44321,4321@firewall.servers.com:44322
$ pcp &minus;h nas1.servers.com:44321@firewall.servers.com:44322
$ pcp &minus;h nas1.servers.com:44321@firewall.servers.com
$ pcp &minus;h nas1.servers.com@firewall.servers.com
$ pcp &minus;h nas1.servers.com:44321
$ pcp &minus;h [fe80::2ad2:44ff:fe88:e4f1%p2p1]
$ pcp &minus;h 192.168.0.103</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
&lsquo;&lsquo;connection attributes&rsquo;&rsquo; can also
be specified. These include username, password (can be given
interactively and may depend on the authentication mechanism
employed), whether to target a specific running container,
whether to use secure (encrypted) or native (naked)
protocol, and so on. The previous examples all default to
native protocol, and use no authentication. This can be
altered, as in the following examples.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">$ pcp &minus;h pcps://app2.servers.com?container=cae8e6edc0d5
$ pcp &minus;h pcps://nas1.servers.com:44321?username=tanya&amp;method=gssapi
$ pcp &minus;h pcps://nas2.servers.com@firewalls.r.us?method=plain
$ pcp &minus;h pcp://nas3.servers.com
$ pcp &minus;h 192.168.0.103?container=cae8e6edc0d5,method=digest-md5
$ pcp &minus;h unix:
$ pcp &minus;h local:</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The choice of
authentication method, and other resulting parameters like
username, optionally password, etc, depends on the SASL2
configuration used by each (remote) <b>pmcd</b>. Tutorials
are available specifying various aspects of configuring the
authentication module(s) used, these fine details are
outside the scope of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all
situations, host names can be used interchangeably with IPv4
or IPv6 addressing (directly), as shown above. In the case
of an IPv6 address, the full address must be enclosed by
square brackets and the scope (interface) must also be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final
<i>local:</i> example above is now the default for most
tools. This connection is an automatically authenticated
local host connection on all platforms that support Unix
domain sockets. No password is required and authentication
is automatic. This is also the most efficient (lowest
overhead) communication channel available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The difference
between <i>unix:</i> and <i>local:</i> is that the former is
a strict Unix domain socket specification (connection fails
if it cannot connect that way), whereas the latter has a
more forgiving fallback to using <i>localhost</i> (i.e. a
regular Inet socket connection is used when Unix domain
socket connections are unavailable).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the PCP run-time environment and configuration variables
described in the <b>PCP ENVIRONMENT</b> section below, the
following environment variables apply to all
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that most
uses of these environment variables are optimized to check
the environment only the first time the variable might be
used. As the environment usually is not checked again, the
only safe strategy is to ensure all PCP-related environment
variables are set before the first call into any of the PCP
libraries. <b><br>
PCP_ALLOW_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, allow clients to
accept certificates with mismatched domain names with no
prompt when they are sent by <b>pmcd</b> or other server
components. See <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_ALLOW_SERVER_SELF_CERT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, allow clients to
accept self-signed certificates with no prompt when they are
sent by <b>pmcd</b> or other server components. See
<b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_CONSOLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this changes the
default console from <i>/dev/tty</i> (on Unix) or
<i>CON:</i> (on Windows) to be the specified console. The
special value of <i>none</i> can be used to indicate no
console is available for use. This is used in places where
console-based tools need to interact with the user, and in
particular is used when authentication is being
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this variable
provides an alternate way to initialize the value used to
control diagnostic and debug output (the default value is 0
to suppress this output). The value for <b>$PCP_DEBUG</b>
should be a decimal integer, see <b>pmdbg</b>(1) for a
description of the supported values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this variable defines
a colon separated list of files and/or directories (the
syntax is the same as for the <b>$PATH</b> variable for
<b>sh</b>(1)). The components are expanded into a list of
files as follows: if a component of
<b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b> is a file, then that file is
added to the list, else if a component is a directory then
recursive descent is used to enumerate all files below that
directory and these are added to the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each file in
the resulting list is assumed to contain definitions of
derived metrics as per the syntax described in
<b>pmLoadDerivedConfig</b>(3), and these are loaded in
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Derived metrics
may be used to extend the available metrics with new
(derived) metrics using simple arithmetic expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b> is set, the derived metric
definitions are processed automatically as each new source
of performance metrics is established (i.e. each time a
<b>pmNewContext</b>(3) is called) or when requests are made
against the PMNS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Any component
in the <b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b> list or the expanded list
of files that is not a file, or is not a directory or is not
accessible (due to permissions or a bad symbolic link) will
be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this variable forces
any monitor tool connections to be established using the
certificate-based secure sockets feature. If the connections
cannot be established securely, they will fail.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_SECURE_DB_METHOD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With secure socket connections,
the certificate and key database is stored using the
<b>sql:</b> method by default. Use
<b>PCP_SECURE_DB_METHOD</b> to override the default, most
usually setting the value to the empty string (for the older
database methods).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_SECURE_DB_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set, this variable
specifies an alternate certficate database path for client
tools. Similar to the action of the -C option for
<b>pmcd</b>(1) and <b>pmproxy</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_STDERR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Many PCP tools support the
environment variable <b>PCP_STDERR</b>, which can be used to
control where error messages are sent. When unset, the
default behavior is that &lsquo;&lsquo;usage&rsquo;&rsquo;
messages and option parsing errors are reported on standard
error, other messages after initial startup are sent to the
default destination for the tool, i.e. standard error for
ASCII tools, or a dialog for GUI tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>PCP_STDERR</b> is set to the literal value <b>DISPLAY</b>
then all messages will be displayed in a dialog. This is
used for any tools launched from the a Desktop
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>PCP_STDERR</b> is set to any other value, the value is
assumed to be a filename, and all messages will be written
there.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When attempting to connect to a
remote <b>pmcd</b>(1) on a machine that is booting, the
connection attempt could potentially block for a long time
until the remote machine finishes its initialization. Most
PCP applications and some of the PCP library routines will
abort and return an error if the connection has not been
established after some specified interval has elapsed. The
default interval is 5 seconds. This may be modified by
setting <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> in the environment to a
real number of seconds for the desired timeout. This is most
useful in cases where the remote host is at the end of a
slow network, requiring longer latencies to establish the
connection correctly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a monitor or client
application loses a connection to a <b>pmcd</b>(1), the
connection may be re-established by calling a service
routine in the PCP library. However, attempts to reconnect
are controlled by a back-off strategy to avoid flooding the
network with reconnection requests. By default, the back-off
delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 seconds for consecutive
reconnection requests from a client (the last delay will be
repeated for any further attempts after the fifth). Setting
the environment variable <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> to a
comma separated list of positive integers will re-define the
back-off delays, e.g. setting <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
to &lsquo;&lsquo;1,2&rsquo;&rsquo; will back-off for 1
second, then attempt another connection request every 2
seconds thereafter.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For monitor or client
applications connected to <b>pmcd</b>(1), there is a
possibility of the application &quot;hanging&quot; on a
request for performance metrics or metadata or help text.
These delays may become severe if the system running
<b>pmcd</b> crashes, or the network connection is lost. By
setting the environment variable <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
to a number of seconds, requests to <b>pmcd</b> will timeout
after this number of seconds. The default behavior is to be
willing to wait 10 seconds for a response from every
<b>pmcd</b> for all applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When <b>pmcd</b>(1) is started
from <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp</b> then the primary instance of
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) will be started if the configuration flag
<b>pmlogger</b> is <b>chkconfig</b>(8) enabled and
<b>pmcd</b> is running and accepting connections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The check on
<b>pmcd</b>&rsquo;s readiness will wait up to
<b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b> seconds. If <b>pmcd</b> has a long
startup time (such as on a very large system), then
<b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b> can be set to provide a maximum
wait longer than the default 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, then interpreted as the
full pathname to be used as the default local PMNS for
<b>pmLoadNameSpace</b>(3). Otherwise, the default local PMNS
is located at <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pcp/pmns/root</b> for base PCP
installations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Many of the performance metrics
exported from PCP agents have the semantics of
<i>counter</i> meaning they are expected to be monotonically
increasing. Under some circumstances, one value of these
metrics may smaller than the previously fetched value. This
can happen when a counter of finite precision overflows, or
when the PCP agent has been reset or restarted, or when the
PCP agent is exporting values from some underlying
instrumentation that is subject to some asynchronous
discontinuity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable <b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</b> may be set to indicate that
all such cases of a decreasing
&lsquo;&lsquo;counter&rsquo;&rsquo; should be treated as a
counter overflow, and hence the values are assumed to have
wrapped once in the interval between consecutive samples.
This &lsquo;&lsquo;wrapping&rsquo;&rsquo; behavior was the
default in earlier PCP versions, but by default has been
disabled in PCP release from version 1.3 on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMDA_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>PMDA_PATH</b>
environment variable may be used to modify the search path
used by <b>pmcd</b>(1) and <b>pmNewContext</b>(3) (for
<b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> contexts) when searching for a
daemon or DSO PMDA. The syntax follows that for <b>PATH</b>
in <b>sh</b>(1), i.e. a colon separated list of directories,
and the default search path is
&lsquo;&lsquo;/var/pcp/lib:/usr/pcp/lib&rsquo;&rsquo;, (or
&lsquo;&lsquo;/var/lib/pcp/lib&rsquo;&rsquo; on Linux,
depending on the value of the $PCP_VAR_DIR environment
variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The TPC/IP port(s) used by
<b>pmcd</b>(1) to create the socket for incoming connections
and requests, was historically 4321 and more recently the
officially registered port 44321; in the current release,
<b>both</b> port numbers are used by default as a
transitional arrangement. This may be over-ridden by setting
<b>PMCD_PORT</b> to a different port number, or a
comma-separated list of port numbers. If a non-default port
is used when <b>pmcd</b> is started, then every monitoring
application connecting to that <b>pmcd</b> must also have
<b>PMCD_PORT</b> set in their environment before attempting
a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment variables are relevant to installations in which
<b>pmlogger</b>(1), the PCP archive logger, is used. <b><br>
PMLOGGER_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The environment variable
<b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b> may be used to change the base TCP/IP
port number used by <b>pmlogger</b>(1) to create the socket
to which <b>pmlc</b>(1) instances will try and connect. The
default base port number is 4330. When used,
<b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b> should be set in the environment before
<b>pmlogger</b> is executed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When <b>pmlc</b>(1) connects to
<b>pmlogger</b>(1), there is a remote possibility of
<b>pmlc</b> &quot;hanging&quot; on a request for information
as a consequence of a failure of the network or
<b>pmlogger</b>. By setting the environment variable
<b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b> to a number of seconds,
requests to <b>pmlogger</b> will timeout after this number
of seconds. The default behavior is to be willing to wait
forever for a response from each request to a
<b>pmlogger</b>. When used, <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
should be set in the environment before <b>pmlc</b> is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have the
PCP product installed, then the following environment
variables are relevant to the Performance Metrics Domain
Agents (PMDAs). <b><br>
PMDA_LOCAL_PROC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this variable has been
deprecated and it is now ignored. If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;proc&rsquo;&rsquo; PMDA is configured as a DSO
for use with <b>pmcd</b>(1) on the local host then all of
the &lsquo;&lsquo;proc&rsquo;&rsquo; metrics will be
available to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The previous
behaviour was that if this variable was set, then a context
established with the <i>type</i> of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
will have access to the &lsquo;&lsquo;proc&rsquo;&rsquo;
PMDA to retrieve performance metrics about individual
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMDA_LOCAL_SAMPLE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this variable has been
deprecated and it is now ignored. If the
&lsquo;&lsquo;sample&rsquo;&rsquo; PMDA is configured as a
DSO for use with <b>pmcd</b>(1) on the local host then all
of the &lsquo;&lsquo;sample&rsquo;&rsquo; metrics will be
available to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The previous
behaviour was that if this variable was set, then a context
established with the <i>type</i> of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
will have access to the &lsquo;&lsquo;sample&rsquo;&rsquo;
PMDA if this optional PMDA has been installed locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMIECONF_PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, <b>pmieconf</b>(1) will
form its <b>pmieconf</b>(5) specification (set of
parameterized <b>pmie</b>(1) rules) using all valid
<b>pmieconf</b> files found below each subdirectory in this
colon-separated list of subdirectories. If not set, the
default is <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf</b>.</p>
