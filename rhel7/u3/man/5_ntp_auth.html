<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page
describes the various cryptographic authentication
provisions in NTPv4. Details about the configuration
commands and options are given on the Configuration Options
page. Details about the automatic server discovery schemes
are described on the Automatic Server Discovery Schemes
page. Additional information is available in the papers,
reports, memoranda and briefings cited on the NTP Project
page. Authentication support allows the NTP client to verify
that servers are in fact known and trusted and not intruders
intending accidentally or intentionally to masquerade as a
legitimate server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The NTPv3
specification RFC-1305 defines a scheme properly described
as symmetric key cryptography. It uses the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) algorithm operating in cipher-block chaining
(CBC) mode. Subsequently, this scheme was replaced by the
RSA Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm commonly called
keyed-MD5. Either algorithm computes a message digest or
one-way hash which can be used to verify the client has the
same key and key identifier as the server. If the OpenSSL
cryptographic library is installed, support is available for
all algorithms included in the library. Note however, if
conformance to FIPS 140-2 is required, only a limited subset
of these algorithms is available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NTPv4 includes
the NTPv3 scheme and optionally a new scheme based on public
key cryptography and called Autokey. Public key cryptography
is generally considered more secure than symmetric key
cryptography, since the security is based on private and
public values which are generated by each participant and
where the private value is never revealed. Autokey uses
X.509 public certificates, which can be produced by
commercial services, utility programs in the OpenSSL
software library or the <b>ntp-keygen</b> utility program in
the NTP software distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the
algorithms for MD5 symmetric key cryptography are included
in the NTPv4 software distribution, modern algorithms for
symmetric key and public key cryptograpny requires the
OpenSSL software library to be installed before building the
NTP distribution. This library is available from
http://www.openssl.org and can be installed using the
procedures outlined in the Building and Installing the
Distribution page. Once installed, the configure and build
process automatically detects the library and links the
library routines required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
according to US law, NTP binaries including OpenSSL library
components, including the OpenSSL library itself, cannot be
exported outside the US without license from the US
Department of Commerce. Builders outside the US are advised
to obtain the OpenSSL library directly from OpenSSL, which
is outside the US, and build outside the US.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authentication
is configured separately for each association using the
<b>key</b> or <b>autokey</b> option of the <b>server</b>
configuration command, as described in the Server Options
page, and the options described on this page. The ntp-keygen
page describes the files required for the various
authentication schemes. Further details are in the
briefings, papers and reports at the NTP project page linked
from www.ntp.org.</p>

<h2>SYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
<a name="SYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
RFC-1305 specification allows any one of possibly 65,534
keys (excluding zero), each distinguished by a 32-bit key
ID, to authenticate an association. The servers and clients
involved must agree on the key, key ID and key type to
authenticate NTP packets. If an NTP packet includes a
message authentication code (MAC), consisting of a key ID
and message digest, it is accepted only if the key ID
matches a trusted key and the message digest is verified
with this key. Note that for historic reasons the message
digest algorithm is not consistent with RFC-1828. The digest
is computed directly from the concatenation of the key
string followed by the packet contents with the exception of
the MAC itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keys and
related information are specified in a keys file, usually
called <b>ntp.keys</b>, which must be distributed and stored
using secure means beyond the scope of the NTP protocol
itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations,
additional keys can be used as passwords for the <b>ntpq</b>
and <b>ntpdc</b> utility programs. Ordinarily, the
<b>ntp.keys</b> file is generated by the <b>ntp-keygen</b>
program, but it can be constructed and edited using an
ordinary text editor. The program generates pseudo-random
keys, one key for each line. Each line consists of three
fields, the key identifier as a decimal number from 1 to
65534 inclusive, a key type chosen from the keywords of the
<b>digest</b> option of the <b>crypto</b> command, and a
20-character printable ASCII string or a 40-character hex
string as the key itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>ntpd</b> is first started, it reads the key file
specified by the <b>keys</b> command and installs the keys
in the key cache. However, individual keys must be activated
with the <b>trustedkey</b> configuration command before use.
This allows, for instance, the installation of possibly
several batches of keys and then activating a key remotely
using <b>ntpdc</b>. The <b>requestkey</b> command selects
the key ID used as the password for the <b>ntpdc</b>
utility, while the <b>controlkey</b> command selects the key
ID used as the password for the <b>ntpq</b> utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
message digest algorithm is MD5 selected by the key type
<b>M</b> in the keys file. However, if the OpenSSL library
is installed, any message digest algorithm supported by that
library can be used. The key type is selected as the
algorithm name given in the OpenSSL documentation. The key
type is associated with the key and can be different for
different keys. The server and client must share the same
key, key ID and key type and both must be trusted. Note that
if conformance to FIPS 140-2 is required, the message digest
algorithm must conform to the Secure Hash Standard (SHS),
which requires an algorithm from the Secure Hash Algorithm
(SHA) family, and the digital signature encryption
algorithm, if used, must conform to the Digital Signature
Standard (DSS), which requires the Digital Signature
Algorithm (DSA).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the above means, <b>ntpd</b> now supports Microsoft Windows
MS-SNTP authentication using Active Directory services. This
support was contributed by the Samba Team and is still in
development. It is enabled using the <b>mssntp</b> flag of
the <b>restrict</b> command described on the Access Control
Options page. Note: Potential users should be aware that
these services involve a TCP connection to another process
that could potentially block, denying services to other
users. Therefore, this flag should be used only for a
dedicated server with no clients other than MS-SNTP.</p>

<h2>PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
<a name="PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NTPv4 supports
the Autokey security protocol, which is based on public key
cryptography. The Autokey Version 2 protocol described on
the Autokey Protocol page verifies packet integrity using
MD5 message digests and verifies the source using digital
signatures and any of several digest/signature schemes.
Optional identity schemes described on the Autokey Identity
Schemes page are based on cryptographic challenge/response
exchanges. These schemes provide strong security against
replay with or without message modification, spoofing,
masquerade and most forms of clogging attacks. These schemes
are described along with an executive summary, current
status, briefing slides and reading list on the Autonomous
Authentication page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Autokey
authenticates individual packets using cookies bound to the
IP source and destination addresses. The cookies must have
the same addresses at both the server and client. For this
reason operation with network address translation schemes is
not possible. This reflects the intended robust security
model where government and corporate NTP servers are
operated outside firewall perimeters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
timeouts associated with the Autokey scheme. The key list
timeout, which defaults to about 1.1 h, specifies the
interval between generating new key lists. The revoke
timeout, which defaults to about 36 h, specifies the
interval between generating new private values. The restart
timeout, with default about 5 d, specifies the interval
between protocol restarts to refresh public values. In
general, the behavior when these timeouts expire is not
affected by the issues discussed on this page.</p>

<h2>NTP SECURE GROUPS
<a name="NTP SECURE GROUPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NTP secure
groups are used to define cryptographic compartments and
security hierarchies. All hosts belonging to a secure group
have the same group name but different host names. The
string specified in the <b>host</b> option of the
<b>crypto</b> command is the name of the host and the name
used in the host key, sign key and certificate files. The
string specified in the <b>ident</b> option of the
<b>crypto</b> command is the group name of all group hosts
and the name used in the identity files. The file naming
conventions are described on the ntp-keygen page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each group
includes one or more trusted hosts (THs) operating at the
root, or lowest stratum in the group. The group name is used
in the subject and issuer fields of the TH self-signed
trusted certificate for these hosts. The host name is used
in the subject and issuer fields of the self-signed
certificates for all other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All group hosts
are configured to provide an unbroken path, called a
certificate trail, from each host, possibly via intermediate
hosts and ending at a TH. When a host starts up, it
recursively retrieves the certificates along the trail in
order to verify group membership and avoid masquerade and
middleman attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Secure groups
can be configured as hierarchies where a TH of one group can
be a client of one or more other groups operating at a lower
stratum. A certificate trail consist of a chain of hosts
starting at a client, leading through secondary servers of
progressively lower stratum and ending at a TH. In one
scenario, groups RED and GREEN can be cryptographically
distinct, but both be clients of group BLUE operating at a
lower stratum. In another scenario, group CYAN can be a
client of multiple groups YELLOW and MAGENTA, both operating
at a lower stratum. There are many other scenarios, but all
must be configured to include only acyclic certificate
trails.</p>

<h2>IDENTITY SCHEMES AND CRYPTOTYPES
<a name="IDENTITY SCHEMES AND CRYPTOTYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All
configurations include a public/private host key pair and
matching certificate. Absent an identity scheme, this is a
Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme. There are three identity
schemes, IFF, GQ and MV described on the Identity Schemes
page. With these schemes all servers in the group have
encrypted server identity keys, while clients have
nonencrypted client identity parameters. The client
parameters can be obtained from a trusted agent (TA),
usually one of the THs of the lower stratum group. Further
information on identity schemes is on the Autokey Identity
Schemes page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A specific
combination of authentication and identity schemes is called
a cryptotype, which applies to clients and servers
separately. A group can be configured using more than one
cryptotype combination, although not all combinations are
interoperable. Note however that some cryptotype
combinations may successfully intemperate with each other,
but may not represent good security practice. The server and
client cryptotypes are defined by the the following
codes.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The compatible
cryptotypes for clients and servers are listed in the
following table.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-169661.png" alt="Image grohtml-169661.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">* These combinations are not
valid if the restriction list includes the <b>notrust</b>
option.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Autokey has an
intimidating number of configuration options, most of which
are not necessary in typical scenarios. The simplest
scenario consists of a TH where the host name of the TH is
also the name of the group. For the simplest identity scheme
TC, the TH generates host key and trusted certificate files
using the <b>ntp-keygen -T</b> command, while the remaining
group hosts use the same command with no options to generate
the host key and public certificate files. All hosts use the
<b>crypto</b> configuration command with no options.
Configuration with passwords is described in the ntp-keygen
page. All group hosts are configured as an acyclic tree with
root the TH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an
identity scheme is included, for example IFF, the TH
generates host key, trusted certificate and private server
identity key files using the <b>ntp-keygen -T -I -i</b>
<i>group</i> command, where <i>group</i> is the group name.
The remaining group hosts use the same command as above. All
hosts use the <b>crypto ident group</b> configuration
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hosts with no
dependent clients can retrieve client parameter files from
an archive or web page. The <b>ntp-keygen</b> can export
these data using the <b>-e</b> option. Hosts with dependent
clients other than the TH must retrieve copies of the server
key files using secure means. The <b>ntp-keygen</b> can
export these data using the <b>-q</b> option. In either case
the data are installed as a file and then renamed using the
name given as the first line in the file, but without the
filestamp.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider a
scenario involving three secure groups RED, GREEN and BLUE.
RED and BLUE are typical of national laboratories providing
certified time to the Internet at large. As shown ion the
figure, RED TH mort and BLUE TH macabre run NTP symmetric
mode with each other for monitoring or backup. For the
purpose of illustration, assume both THs are primary
servers. GREEN is typical of a large university providing
certified time to the campus community. GREEN TH howland is
a broadcast client of both RED and BLUE. BLUE uses the IFF
scheme, while both RED and GREEN use the GQ scheme, but with
different keys. YELLOW is a client of GREEN and for purposes
of illustration a TH for YELLOW.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The BLUE TH
macabre uses configuration commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>crypto pw
qqsv ident blue peer mort autokey broadcast</b>
<i>address</i> <b>autokey</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>qqsv</b> is the password for macabre files and
<i>address</i> is the broadcast address for the local LAN.
It generates BLUE files using the commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntp-keygen
-p qqsv -T -G -i blue ntp-keygen -p qqsv -e
&gt;ntpkey_gqpar_blue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
generates the host, trusted certificate and private GQ
server keys file. The second generates the public GQ client
parameters file, which can have any nonconflicting mnemonic
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The RED TH mort
uses configuration commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>crypto pw
xxx ident red peer macabre autokey broadcast</b>
<i>address</i> <b>autokey</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>xxx</b> is the password for mort files. It generates RED
files using the commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntp-keygen
-p xxx -T -I -i red ntp-keygen -p xxx -e
&gt;ntpkey_iffpar_red</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The GREEN TH
howland uses configuration commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>crypto pw
yyy ident green broadcastclient</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>yyy</b> is the password for howland files. It generates
GREEN files using the commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntp-keygen
-p yyy -T -G -i green ntp-keygen -p yyy -e
&gt;ntpkey_gqpar_green ntp-keygen -p yyy -q zzz
&gt;zzz_ntpkey_gqkey_green</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first two
lines serve the same purpose as the preceding examples. The
third line generates a copy of the private GREEN server file
for use on another server in the same group, say YELLOW, but
encrypted with the <b>zzz</b> password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A client of
GREEN, for example YELLOW, uses the configuration
commands</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>crypto pw
abc ident green server howland autokey</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>abc</b> is the password for its files. It generates files
using the command</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntp-keygen
-p abc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The client
retrieves the client file for that group from a public
archive or web page using nonsecure means. In addition, each
server in a group retrieves the private server keys file
from the TH of that group, but it is encrypted and so must
be sent using secure means. The files are installed in the
keys directory with name taken from the first line in the
file, but without the filestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
servers of different groups, in this case RED and BLUE,
share the same broadcast media, each server must have client
files for all groups other than its own, while each client
must have client files for all groups. Note also that this
scenario is for illustration only and probably would not be
wise for practical use, as if one of the TH reference clocks
fails, the certificate trail becomes cyclic. In such cases
the symmetric path between RED and BLUE, each in a different
group, would not be a good idea.</p>

<h2>AUTHENTICATION COMMANDS

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the interval between
regenerations of the session key list used with the Autokey
protocol, as a power of 2 in seconds. Note that the size of
the key list for each association depends on this interval
and the current poll interval. The default interval is 12

interval, a session key list with a single entry will be
regenerated for every message sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>controlkey</b>
<i>keyid</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the key ID to use

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>crypto [randfile</b>
<i>file</i><b>] [host</b> <i>name</i><b>] [ident</b>
<i>name</i><b>] [pw</b> <i>password</i><b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command requires the
OpenSSL library. It activates public key cryptography and
loads the required host key and public certificate. If one
or more files are left unspecified, the default names are
used as described below. Unless the complete path and name
of the file are specified, the location of a file is
relative to the keys directory specified in the
<b>keysdir</b> configuration command or default
<b>/etc/ntp/crypto</b>. Following are the options. <b><br>

<b>RIPEMD160</b> | <b>SHA</b> | <b>SHA1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specify the message digest
algorithm, with default MD5. If the OpenSSL library is
installed, <i>name</i> can be be any message digest
algorithm supported by the library not exceeding 160 bits in
length. However, all Autokey participants in an Autokey
subnet must use the same algorithm. Note that the Autokey
message digest algorithm is separate and distinct form the
symmetric key message digest algorithms. Note: If compliance
with FIPS 140-2 is required, the algorithm must be ether
<b>SHA</b> or <b>SHA1</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>host</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies the string used when
constructing the names for the host, sign and certificate

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the complete path to
the MD5 key file containing the keys and key IDs used by
<b>ntpd</b>, <b>ntpq</b> and <b>ntpdc</b> when operating
with symmetric key cryptography. This is the same operation
as the <b>-k</b> command line option. Note that the
directory path for Autokey media is specified by the
<b>keysdir</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>keysdir</b> <i>path</i>K</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command specifies the
default directory path for Autokey cryptographic keys,
parameters and certificates. The default is
<b>/etc/ntp/crypto</b>. Note that the path for the symmetric
keys file is specified by the <b>keys</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>requestkey</b>
<i>keyid</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the key ID to use
with the <b>ntpdc</b> utility program, which uses a
proprietary protocol specific to this implementation of

trusted key, in the range 1 to 65534, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>revoke
[</b><i>logsec</i><b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the interval between
re-randomization of certain cryptographic values used by the
Autokey scheme, as a power of 2 in seconds. These values
need to be updated frequently in order to deflect
brute-force attacks on the algorithms; however, updating
some values is a relatively expensive operation. The default
interval is 17 (about 36 h). For poll intervals above the
specified interval, the values will be updated for every
message sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trustedkey [</b><i>keyid</i>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specifies the key ID(s) which
are trusted for the purposes of authenticating peers with
symmetric key cryptography. Key IDs used to authenticate
<b>ntpq</b> and <b>ntpdc</b> operations must be listed here
and additionally be enabled with controlkey and/or
requestkey. The authentication procedure for time transfer
require that both the local and remote NTP servers employ
the same key ID and secret for this purpose, although
different keys IDs may be used with different servers.
Ranges of trusted key IDs may be specified:
&quot;<b>trustedkey (1 ... 19) 1000 (100 ... 199)</b>&quot;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Errors can
occur due to mismatched configurations, unexpected protocol
restarts, expired certificates and unfriendly people. In
most cases the protocol state machine recovers automatically
by retransmission, timeout and restart, where necessary.
Some errors are due to mismatched keys, digest schemes or
identity schemes and must be corrected by installing the
correct media and/or correcting the configuration file. One
of the most common errors is expired certificates, which
must be regenerated and signed at least once per year using
the <b>ntp-keygen</b> - generate public and private keys
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
error codes are reported via the NTP control and monitoring
protocol trap mechanism and to the <b>cryptostats</b>
monitoring file if configured. <br>
101 bad field format or length</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The packet has invalid version,
length or format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">102 bad timestamp</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The packet timestamp is the
same or older than the most recent received. This could be
due to a replay or a server clock time step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">103 bad filestamp</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The packet filestamp is the
same or older than the most recent received. This could be
due to a replay or a key file generation error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">104 bad or missing public
key</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The public key is missing, has
incorrect format or is an unsupported type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">105 unsupported digest type</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The server requires an
unsupported digest/signature scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">106 unsupported identity
type</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The client or server has
requested an identity scheme the other does not support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">107 bad signature length</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The signature length does not
match the current public key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">108 signature not verified</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The message fails the signature
check. It could be bogus or signed by a different private
key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">109 certificate not
verified</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The certificate is invalid or
signed with the wrong key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">110 host certificate
