<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SET_CONSTRAINTS
&minus; set constraint check timing for the current
transaction</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SET CONSTRAINTS
{ ALL | <i>name</i> [, ...] } { DEFERRED | IMMEDIATE }</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SET
CONSTRAINTS</b> sets the behavior of constraint checking
within the current transaction. IMMEDIATE constraints are
checked at the end of each statement. DEFERRED constraints
are not checked until transaction commit. Each constraint
has its own IMMEDIATE or DEFERRED mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon creation,
a constraint is given one of three characteristics:
DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED, DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
IMMEDIATE, or NOT DEFERRABLE. The third class is always
IMMEDIATE and is not affected by the <b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b>
command. The first two classes start every transaction in
the indicated mode, but their behavior can be changed within
a transaction by <b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SET
CONSTRAINTS</b> with a list of constraint names changes the
mode of just those constraints (which must all be
deferrable). Each constraint name can be
schema&minus;qualified. The current schema search path is
used to find the first matching name if no schema name is
specified. <b>SET CONSTRAINTS ALL</b> changes the mode of
all deferrable constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When <b>SET
CONSTRAINTS</b> changes the mode of a constraint from
DEFERRED to IMMEDIATE, the new mode takes effect
retroactively: any outstanding data modifications that would
have been checked at the end of the transaction are instead
checked during the execution of the <b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b>
command. If any such constraint is violated, the <b>SET
CONSTRAINTS</b> fails (and does not change the constraint
mode). Thus, <b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b> can be used to force
checking of constraints to occur at a specific point in a
transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, only
UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, REFERENCES (foreign key), and EXCLUDE
constraints are affected by this setting. NOT NULL and CHECK
constraints are always checked immediately when a row is
inserted or modified (<i>not</i> at the end of the
statement). Uniqueness and exclusion constraints that have
not been declared DEFERRABLE are also checked
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The firing of
triggers that are declared as &ldquo;constraint
triggers&rdquo; is also controlled by this setting &mdash;
they fire at the same time that the associated constraint
should be checked.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
PostgreSQL does not require constraint names to be unique
within a schema (but only per&minus;table), it is possible
that there is more than one match for a specified constraint
name. In this case <b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b> will act on all
matches. For a non&minus;schema&minus;qualified name, once a
match or matches have been found in some schema in the
search path, schemas appearing later in the path are not
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
only alters the behavior of constraints within the current
transaction. Thus, if you execute this command outside of a
transaction block (<b>BEGIN</b>/<b>COMMIT</b> pair), it will
not appear to have any effect.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
complies with the behavior defined in the SQL standard,
except for the limitation that, in PostgreSQL, it does not
apply to NOT NULL and CHECK constraints. Also, PostgreSQL
checks non&minus;deferrable uniqueness constraints
immediately, not at end of statement as the standard would
suggest.</p>
