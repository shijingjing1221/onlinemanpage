http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The X.500
Directory uses distinguished names (DNs) as primary keys to
entries in the directory. This document defines the string
representation used in the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small> ) to transfer distinguished

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each attribute
stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) directory, whose values may be
transferred in the <small>LDAP</small> protocol, has a
defined syntax that constrains the structure and format of
its values. The comparison semantics for values of a syntax
are not part of the syntax definition but are instead
provided through separately defined matching rules. Matching
rules specify an argument, an assertion value, which also
has a defined syntax. This document defines a base set of
syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes
for <small>LDAP</small> directories.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>RFC&minus;4518</small>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The previous
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small>
) technical specifications did not precisely define how
character string matching is to be performed. This led to a
number of usability and interoperability problems. This
document defines string preparation algorithms for
character-based matching rules defined for use in
<small>LDAP.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small> ) technical specification. It
provides a technical specification of attribute types and
object classes intended for use by <small>LDAP</small>
directory clients for many directory services, such as White
Pages. These objects are widely used as a basis for the
schema in many <small>LDAP</small> directories. This
document does not cover attributes used for the
administration of directory servers, nor does it include
directory objects defined for specific uses in other
documents.</p>

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6171.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) Don&rsquo;t Use Copy control extension
which allows a client to specify that copied information
should not be used in providing service. This control is
based upon the X.511 dontUseCopy service control option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) Assertion Control, which allows a
client to specify that a directory operation should only be
processed if an assertion applied to the target entry of the
operation is true. It can be used to construct &quot;test

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4522.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each attribute
stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) directory has a defined syntax (i.e.,
data type). A syntax definition specifies how attribute
values conforming to the syntax are normally represented
when transferred in <small>LDAP</small> operations. This
representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding
to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute
values. This document defines an attribute option, the
binary option, that can be used to specify that the
associated attribute values are instead encoded according to
the Basic Encoding Rules ( <small>BER</small> ) used by
X.500 directories.</p>

based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core
Information Model ( <small>PCIM</small> ) Extensions (
<small>RFC 3460</small> ). These changes and extensions
consist of new <small>LDAP</small> object classes and
attribute types. Some of the schema items defined in this
document re-implement existing concepts in accordance with
their new semantics introduced by <small>RFC 3460.</small>
The other schema items implement new concepts, not covered

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) Client Update Protocol (
<small>LCUP</small> ). The protocol is intended to allow an
<small>LDAP</small> client to synchronize with the content
of a directory information tree ( <small>DIT</small> )
stored by an <small>LDAP</small> server and to be notified
about the changes to that content.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>RFC&minus;3909</small>
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small>

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3909.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small> ) extended operation to
cancel (or abandon) an outstanding operation. Unlike the
<small>LDAP</small> Abandon operation, but like the X.511
Directory Access Protocol ( <small>DAP</small> ) Abandon
operation, this operation has a response which provides an
indication of its outcome.</p>

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3876.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes a control for the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol version 3 that is used to return a subset of
attribute values from an entry. Specifically, only those
values that match a &quot;values return&quot; filter.
Without support for this control, a client must retrieve all
of an attribute&rsquo;s values and search for specific
values locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is often
desirable to be able to indicate the natural language
associated with values held in a directory and to be able to
query the directory for values which fulfill the
user&rsquo;s language needs. This document details the use
of Language Tags and Ranges in the Lightweight Directory

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
updates the specification of the component matching rules
for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) and X.500 directories (
<small>RFC3687</small> ) by collecting the Abstract Syntax
Notation One ( <small>ASN.1</small> ) definitions of the
component matching rules into an appropriately identified
<small>ASN.1</small> module so that other specifications may
reference the component matching rule definitions from
within their own <small>ASN.1</small> modules.</p>

Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) Schema</b> <br>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3703.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
defines a mapping of the Policy Core Information Model to a
form that can be implemented in a directory that uses
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small>
) as its access protocol. This model defines two hierarchies
of object classes: structural classes representing
information for representing and controlling policy data as
specified in <small>RFC 3060,</small> and relationship
classes that indicate how instances of the structural
classes are related to each other. Classes are also added to
the <small>LDAP</small> schema to improve the performance of
a client&rsquo;s interactions with an <small>LDAP</small>
server when the client is retrieving large amounts of
policy-related information. These classes exist only to
optimize <small>LDAP</small> retrievals: there are no
classes in the information model that correspond to
them.</p>

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3698.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
provides a collection of matching rules for use with the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small>
). As these matching rules are simple adaptations of
matching rules specified for use with the X.500 Directory,
most are already in wide use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>RFC&minus;3687</small>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntaxes of
attributes in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ) or X.500 directory range from simple
data types, such as text string, integer, or boolean, to
complex structured data types, such as the syntaxes of the
directory schema operational attributes. Matching rules
defined for the complex syntaxes usually only provide the
most immediately useful matching capability. This document
defines generic matching rules that can match any user
selected component parts in an attribute value of any
arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.</p>

has introduced non-DN authentication identities and allowed
for non-directory storage of passwords. As such, mechanisms
which update the directory (e.g., Modify) cannot be used to
change a user&rsquo;s password. This document describes an

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr
-- Administrator Address Attribute</b> <br>
Organizations running multiple directory servers need an
ability for administrators to determine who is responsible
for a particular server. This is conceptually similar to the
&rsquo;sysContact&rsquo; object of <small>SNMP.</small> The
administratorsAddress attribute allows a server
administrator to provide the contact information of the
responsible party for an <small>LDAP</small> server. This
can be used by management clients which are, for example,
checking the state of a replication or referral topology, to
provide a way for the user of the management client to send
email to manager of a particular server.</p>

control can be used to discover how a server might react to
a particular update request without updating the
directory.</p>

-- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (
<small>LDAP</small> ): Transfer Encoding Options</b> <br>
Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small> ) directory has a defined
syntax (i.e., data type). A syntax definition specifies how
attribute values conforming to the syntax are normally
represented when transferred in <small>LDAP</small>
operations. This representation is referred to as the
LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods
of encoding attribute values. This document introduces a new
category of attribute options, called transfer encoding
options, that can be used to specify that the associated
attribute values are encoded according to one of these other
methods.</p>

This document defines an &rsquo;namedObject&rsquo;
structural object class for the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol ( <small>LDAP</small> ) and X.500. This is useful
for entries with no natural choice of structural object
class, e.g. if an entry must exist even though its contents

-- Ordered Entries and Values in <small>LDAP</small></b>
<br>
As <small>LDAP</small> is used more extensively for managing
various kinds of data, one often encounters a need to
preserve both the ordering and the content of data, despite
the inherently unordered structure of entries and attribute
values in the directory. This document describes a scheme to
attach ordering information to attributes in a directory so
that the ordering may be preserved and propagated to other

provide the server&rsquo;s operational logs themselves as a
searchable <small>LDAP</small> directory. These logs may
also be used as a persistent change log to support various
replication mechanisms. This document defines a schema that

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>draft-wahl-ldap-session
-- <small>LDAP</small> Session Tracking Control</b> <br>
Many network devices, application servers, and middleware
components of a enterprise software infrastructure generate
some form of session tracking identifiers, which are useful
when analyzing activity and accounting logs to group
activity relating to a particular session. This document
discusses how Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version
3 ( <small>LDAP</small> ) clients can include session
tracking identifiers with their <small>LDAP</small>
requests. This information is provided through controls in
the requests the clients send to <small>LDAP</small>
servers. The <small>LDAP</small> server receiving these
controls can include the session tracking identifiers the
the log messages it writes, enabling <small>LDAP</small>
requests in the <small>LDAP</small> server&rsquo;s logs to
be correlated with activity in logs of other components in
the infrastructure. The control also enables session
tracking information to be generated by <small>LDAP</small>
servers and returned to clients and other servers. Three
formats of session tracking identifiers are defined in this
document.</p>

This document describes a Virtual List View control
extension for the <small>LDAP</small> Search operation. This
control is designed to allow the &quot;virtual list
box&quot; feature, common in existing commercial
e&minus;mail address book applications, to be supported
efficiently by <small>LDAP</small> servers.
<small>LDAP</small> servers&rsquo; inability to support this
client feature is a significant impediment to
<small>LDAP</small> replacing proprietary protocols in
commercial e&minus;mail systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
allows a client to specify that the server return, for a
given <small>LDAP</small> search with associated sort keys,
a contiguous subset of the search result set. This subset is
specified in terms of offsets into the ordered list, or in
terms of a greater than or equal comparison value.</p>
