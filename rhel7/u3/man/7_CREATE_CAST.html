<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
CAST</b> defines a new cast. A cast specifies how to perform
a conversion between two data types. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT CAST(42
AS float8);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">converts the
integer constant 42 to type float8 by invoking a previously
specified function, in this case float8(int4). (If no
suitable cast has been defined, the conversion fails.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two types can
be binary coercible, which means that the conversion can be
performed &ldquo;for free&rdquo; without invoking any
function. This requires that corresponding values use the
same internal representation. For instance, the types text
and varchar are binary coercible both ways. Binary
coercibility is not necessarily a symmetric relationship.
For example, the cast from xml to text can be performed for
free in the present implementation, but the reverse
direction requires a function that performs at least a
syntax check. (Two types that are binary coercible both ways
are also referred to as binary compatible.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can define
a cast as an I/O conversion cast by using the WITH INOUT
syntax. An I/O conversion cast is performed by invoking the
output function of the source data type, and passing the
resulting string to the input function of the target data
type. In many common cases, this feature avoids the need to
write a separate cast function for conversion. An I/O
conversion cast acts the same as a regular
function&minus;based cast; only the implementation is
different.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, a
cast can be invoked only by an explicit cast request, that
is an explicit CAST(<i>x</i> AS <i>typename</i>) or
<i>x</i>::<i>typename</i> construct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the cast is
marked AS ASSIGNMENT then it can be invoked implicitly when
assigning a value to a column of the target data type. For
example, supposing that foo.f1 is a column of type text,
then:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">INSERT INTO foo
(f1) VALUES (42);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will be allowed
if the cast from type integer to type text is marked AS
ASSIGNMENT, otherwise not. (We generally use the term
assignment cast to describe this kind of cast.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the cast is
marked AS IMPLICIT then it can be invoked implicitly in any
context, whether assignment or internally in an expression.
(We generally use the term implicit cast to describe this
kind of cast.) For example, consider this query:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT 2 +
4.0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parser
initially marks the constants as being of type integer and
numeric respectively. There is no integer+numeric operator
in the system catalogs, but there is a numeric+numeric
operator. The query will therefore succeed if a cast from
integer to numeric is available and is marked AS IMPLICIT
&mdash; which in fact it is. The parser will apply the
implicit cast and resolve the query as if it had been
written</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT CAST ( 2
AS numeric ) + 4.0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, the
catalogs also provide a cast from numeric to integer. If
that cast were marked AS IMPLICIT &mdash; which it is not
&mdash; then the parser would be faced with choosing between
the above interpretation and the alternative of casting the
numeric constant to integer and applying the integer+integer
operator. Lacking any knowledge of which choice to prefer,
it would give up and declare the query ambiguous. The fact
that only one of the two casts is implicit is the way in
which we teach the parser to prefer resolution of a mixed
numeric&minus;and&minus;integer expression as numeric; there
is no built&minus;in knowledge about that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is wise to
be conservative about marking casts as implicit. An
overabundance of implicit casting paths can cause PostgreSQL
to choose surprising interpretations of commands, or to be
unable to resolve commands at all because there are multiple
possible interpretations. A good rule of thumb is to make a
cast implicitly invokable only for
information&minus;preserving transformations between types
in the same general type category. For example, the cast
from int2 to int4 can reasonably be implicit, but the cast
from float8 to int4 should probably be
assignment&minus;only. Cross&minus;type&minus;category
casts, such as text to int4, are best made
explicit&minus;only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
Sometimes it is necessary for usability or
standards&minus;compliance reasons to provide multiple
implicit casts among a set of types, resulting in ambiguity
that cannot be avoided as above. The parser has a fallback
heuristic based on type categories and preferred types that
can help to provide desired behavior in such cases. See
CREATE TYPE (<b>CREATE_TYPE</b>(7)) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To be able to
create a cast, you must own the source or the target data
type and have USAGE privilege on the other type. To create a
binary&minus;coercible cast, you must be superuser. (This
restriction is made because an erroneous
binary&minus;coercible cast conversion can easily crash the
server.)</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>source_type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the source data
type of the cast.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>target_type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the target data
type of the cast.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>function_name</i>(<i>argument_type</i>
[, ...])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The function used to perform
the cast. The function name can be schema&minus;qualified.
If it is not, the function will be looked up in the schema
search path. The function's result data type must match the
target type of the cast. Its arguments are discussed
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WITHOUT
FUNCTION</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicates that the source type
is binary&minus;coercible to the target type, so no function
is required to perform the cast.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WITH INOUT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicates that the cast is an
I/O conversion cast, performed by invoking the output
function of the source data type, and passing the resulting
string to the input function of the target data type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AS
ASSIGNMENT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicates that the cast can be
invoked implicitly in assignment contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AS IMPLICIT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicates that the cast can be
invoked implicitly in any context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cast
implementation functions can have one to three arguments.
The first argument type must be identical to or
binary&minus;coercible from the cast's source type. The
second argument, if present, must be type integer; it
receives the type modifier associated with the destination
type, or &minus;1 if there is none. The third argument, if
present, must be type boolean; it receives true if the cast
is an explicit cast, false otherwise. (Bizarrely, the SQL
standard demands different behaviors for explicit and
implicit casts in some cases. This argument is supplied for
functions that must implement such casts. It is not
recommended that you design your own data types so that this
matters.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return type
of a cast function must be identical to or
binary&minus;coercible to the cast's target type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily a
cast must have different source and target data types.
However, it is allowed to declare a cast with identical
source and target types if it has a cast implementation
function with more than one argument. This is used to
represent type&minus;specific length coercion functions in
the system catalogs. The named function is used to coerce a
value of the type to the type modifier value given by its
second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a cast has
different source and target types and a function that takes
more than one argument, it supports converting from one type
to another and applying a length coercion in a single step.
When no such entry is available, coercion to a type that
uses a type modifier involves two cast steps, one to convert
between data types and a second to apply the modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A cast to or
from a domain type currently has no effect. Casting to or
from a domain uses the casts associated with its underlying
type.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use DROP CAST
(<b>DROP_CAST</b>(7)) to remove user&minus;defined
casts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
if you want to be able to convert types both ways you need
to declare casts both ways explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is normally
not necessary to create casts between user&minus;defined
types and the standard string types (text, varchar, and
char(<i>n</i>), as well as user&minus;defined types that are
defined to be in the string category). PostgreSQL provides
automatic I/O conversion casts for that. The automatic casts
to string types are treated as assignment casts, while the
automatic casts from string types are explicit&minus;only.
You can override this behavior by declaring your own cast to
replace an automatic cast, but usually the only reason to do
so is if you want the conversion to be more easily invokable
than the standard assignment&minus;only or
explicit&minus;only setting. Another possible reason is that
you want the conversion to behave differently from the
type's I/O function; but that is sufficiently surprising
that you should think twice about whether it's a good idea.
(A small number of the built&minus;in types do indeed have
different behaviors for conversions, mostly because of
requirements of the SQL standard.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to
PostgreSQL 7.3, every function that had the same name as a
data type, returned that data type, and took one argument of
a different type was automatically a cast function. This
convention has been abandoned in face of the introduction of
schemas and to be able to represent binary&minus;coercible
casts in the system catalogs. The built&minus;in cast
functions still follow this naming scheme, but they have to
be shown as casts in the system catalog pg_cast as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While not
required, it is recommended that you continue to follow this
old convention of naming cast implementation functions after
the target data type. Many users are used to being able to
cast data types using a function&minus;style notation, that
is <i>typename</i>(<i>x</i>). This notation is in fact
nothing more nor less than a call of the cast implementation
function; it is not specially treated as a cast. If your
conversion functions are not named to support this
convention then you will have surprised users. Since
PostgreSQL allows overloading of the same function name with
different argument types, there is no difficulty in having
multiple conversion functions from different types that all
use the target type's name.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
Actually the preceding paragraph is an oversimplification:
there are two cases in which a function&minus;call construct
will be treated as a cast request without having matched it
to an actual function. If a function call
<i>name</i>(<i>x</i>) does not exactly match any existing
function, but <i>name</i> is the name of a data type and
pg_cast provides a binary&minus;coercible cast to this type
from the type of <i>x</i>, then the call will be construed
as a binary&minus;coercible cast. This exception is made so
that binary&minus;coercible casts can be invoked using
functional syntax, even though they lack any function.
Likewise, if there is no pg_cast entry but the cast would be
to or from a string type, the call will be construed as an
I/O conversion cast. This exception allows I/O conversion
casts to be invoked using functional syntax.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
There is also an exception to the exception: I/O conversion
casts from composite types to string types cannot be invoked
using functional syntax, but must be written in explicit
cast syntax (either CAST or :: notation). This exception was
added because after the introduction of
automatically&minus;provided I/O conversion casts, it was
found too easy to accidentally invoke such a cast when a
function or column reference was intended.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>CREATE
CAST</b> command conforms to the SQL standard, except that
SQL does not make provisions for binary&minus;coercible
types or extra arguments to implementation functions. AS
IMPLICIT is a PostgreSQL extension, too.</p>
