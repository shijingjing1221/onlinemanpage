<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>pg_resetxlog</b></i>
clears the write&minus;ahead log (WAL) and optionally resets
some other control information stored in the pg_control
file. This function is sometimes needed if these files have
become corrupted. It should be used only as a last resort,
when the server will not start due to such corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After running
this command, it should be possible to start the server, but
bear in mind that the database might contain inconsistent
data due to partially&minus;committed transactions. You
should immediately dump your data, run <b>initdb</b>, and
reload. After reload, check for inconsistencies and repair
as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
can only be run by the user who installed the server,
because it requires read/write access to the data directory.
For safety reasons, you must specify the data directory on
the command line. <b>pg_resetxlog</b> does not use the
environment variable <b>PGDATA</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> complains that it cannot determine valid
data for pg_control, you can force it to proceed anyway by
specifying the <b>&minus;f</b> (force) option. In this case
plausible values will be substituted for the missing data.
Most of the fields can be expected to match, but manual
assistance might be needed for the next OID, next
transaction ID and epoch, next multitransaction ID and
offset, and WAL starting address fields. These fields can be
set using the options discussed below. If you are not able
to determine correct values for all these fields,
<b>&minus;f</b> can still be used, but the recovered
database must be treated with even more suspicion than
usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative. <i>Do
not</i> execute any data&minus;modifying operations in the
database before you dump, as any such action is likely to
make the corruption worse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;o</b>, <b>&minus;x</b>, <b>&minus;e</b>,
<b>&minus;m</b>, <b>&minus;O</b>, and <b>&minus;l</b>
options allow the next OID, next transaction ID, next
transaction ID's epoch, next multitransaction ID, next
multitransaction offset, and WAL starting address values to
be set manually. These are only needed when
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> is unable to determine appropriate
values by reading pg_control. Safe values can be determined
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A safe
value for the next transaction ID (<b>&minus;x</b>) can be
determined by looking for the numerically largest file name
in the directory pg_clog under the data directory, adding
one, and then multiplying by 1048576. Note that the file
names are in hexadecimal. It is usually easiest to specify
the option value in hexadecimal too. For example, if 0011 is
the largest entry in pg_clog, &minus;x 0x1200000 will work
(five trailing zeroes provide the proper multiplier).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A safe
value for the next multitransaction ID (<b>&minus;m</b>) can
be determined by looking for the numerically largest file
name in the directory pg_multixact/offsets under the data
directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536. As
above, the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way
to do this is to specify the option value in hexadecimal and
add four zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A safe
value for the next multitransaction offset (<b>&minus;O</b>)
can be determined by looking for the numerically largest
file name in the directory pg_multixact/members under the
data directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536.
As above, the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest
way to do this is to specify the option value in hexadecimal
and add four zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The WAL
starting address (<b>&minus;l</b>) should be larger than any
WAL segment file name currently existing in the directory
pg_xlog under the data directory. These names are also in
hexadecimal and have three parts. The first part is the
&ldquo;timeline ID&rdquo; and should usually be kept the
same. Do not choose a value larger than 255 (0xFF) for the
third part; instead increment the second part and reset the
third part to 0. For example, if 00000001000000320000004A is
the largest entry in pg_xlog, &minus;l 0x1,0x32,0x4B will
work; but if the largest entry is 000000010000003A000000FF,
choose &minus;l 0x1,0x3B,0x0 or more.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big>
<br>
pg_resetxlog</b> itself looks at the files in pg_xlog and
chooses a default <b>&minus;l</b> setting beyond the last
existing file name. Therefore, manual adjustment of
<b>&minus;l</b> should only be needed if you are aware of
WAL segment files that are not currently present in pg_xlog,
such as entries in an offline archive; or if the contents of
pg_xlog have been lost entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; There is
no comparably easy way to determine a next OID that's beyond
the largest one in the database, but fortunately it is not
critical to get the next&minus;OID setting right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
transaction ID epoch is not actually stored anywhere in the
database except in the field that is set by
<b>pg_resetxlog</b>, so any value will work so far as the
database itself is concerned. You might need to adjust this
value to ensure that replication systems such as
Slony&minus;I work correctly &mdash; if so, an appropriate
value should be obtainable from the state of the downstream
replicated database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<b>&minus;n</b> (no operation) option instructs
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> to print the values reconstructed from
pg_control and then exit without modifying anything. This is
mainly a debugging tool, but can be useful as a sanity check
before allowing <b>pg_resetxlog</b> to proceed for
real.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<b>&minus;V</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;version</b> options
print the pg_resetxlog version and exit. The options
<b>&minus;?</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;help</b> show supported
arguments, and exit.</big></p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
command must not be used when the server is running.
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> will refuse to start up if it finds a
server lock file in the data directory. If the server
crashed then a lock file might have been left behind; in
that case you can remove the lock file to allow
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> to run. But before you do so, make
doubly certain that there is no server process still
alive.</big></p>
