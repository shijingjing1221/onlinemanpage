<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sane&minus;mustek
&minus; SANE backend for Mustek SCSI flatbed scanners (and
some other devices)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sane&minus;mustek</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Mustek (and
some relabeled Trust and Primax) SCSI and parport flatbed
scanners. At present, the following scanners are known to
work more or less with this backend:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Paragon
MFS-6000CX <br>
Paragon MFS-12000CX <br>
Paragon MFC-600S, 600 II CD, ScanMagic 600 II SP <br>
Paragon MFC-800S, 800 II SP <br>
Paragon MFS-6000SP <br>
Paragon MFS-8000SP <br>
Paragon MFS-1200SP, MFS-12000SP <br>
ScanExpress 6000SP <br>
ScanExpress 12000SP, 12000SP Plus, Paragon 1200 III SP,
ScanMagic 9636S, 9636S Plus <br>
Paragon 1200 LS <br>
ScanExpress A3 SP <br>
Paragon 1200 SP Pro <br>
Paragon 1200 A3 Pro <br>
Paragon 600 II EP <br>
Paragon 600 II N <br>
Trust Imagery 1200 <br>
Trust Imagery 1200 SP <br>
Trust Imagery 4800 SP <br>
Trust SCSI Connect 19200 <br>
Primax Compact 4800 SCSI</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More details
can be found on the Mustek SCSI backend homepage
<i>http://www.meier&minus;geinitz.de/sane/mustek&minus;backend/</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t mix
up MFS (Paragon), Pro and ScanExpress models! They&rsquo;re
completely different. Check the exact model name!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that most
of the above scanners come with a SCSI interface. The only
non-SCSI scanners that have some support at this point is
the 600 II N and 600 II EP scanners. The former one comes
with its own parallel port adapter (i.e., it does <i>not</i>
attach to the printer port). Both scanners use the SCSI
protocol internally, too. More info on how to use these
parallel port scanners can be found below in section
<b>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS</b>. Other parallel port scanners
are not supported by this backend but you may be successful
using the Mustek parallel port backend mustek_pp, see
<b>sane&minus;mustek_pp</b>(5). USB scanners are also not
supported by this backend but the ma1509, mustek_usb,
gt68xx, and plustek backends include support for some of
them, see <b>sane&minus;ma1509</b>(5),
<b>sane&minus;mustek_usb</b>(5),
<b>sane&minus;gt68xx</b>(5), and
<b>sane&minus;plustek</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mustek scanners
have no protection against exceeding the physical scan area
height. That is, if a scan is attempted with a height that
exceeds the height of the scan surface, the scanner begins
making loud noises and the scan mechanism may be damaged.
Thus, if you hear such a noise, IMMEDIATELY turn off the
scanner. This shouldn&rsquo;t happen if your scanner is in
the list of known scanners. There is more information in the
<i>/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.24/PROBLEMS</i>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you own a
Mustek (or Trust) scanner other than the ones listed above
that works with this backend, please let us know by sending
the scanner&rsquo;s exact model name (look at the front and
back of the scanner) and a debug output to
<i>sane&minus;devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</i>. You can get
the debug output by setting the environment variable
<b>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK</b> to 5 and showing the list of
available scanners with scanimage &minus;L. Please send all
of it to the mailing list. You must be subscribed to
sane&minus;devel before you can send mail to the list. See
<i>http://www.sane&minus;project.org/mailing&minus;lists.html</i>
for details.</p>

<h2>DEVICE NAMES
<a name="DEVICE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
expects device names of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>special</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>special</i> is either the path-name for the special
device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner or the port number
at which the parallel port scanners can be found (see
section <b>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS</b> below). For SCSI
scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device. The program
<i>sane&minus;find&minus;scanner</i> helps to find out the
correct device. Under Linux, such a device name could be
<i>/dev/sg0</i> or <i>/dev/sg3</i>, for example. See
<b>sane&minus;scsi</b>(5) for details.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the <i>mustek.conf</i> file is a list of options and device
names that correspond to Mustek scanners. Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See
<b>sane&minus;scsi</b>(5) on details of what constitutes a
valid device name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The supported
options are <b>linedistance&minus;fix</b>,
<b>lineart&minus;fix</b>, <b>legal&minus;size</b>,
<b>buffersize</b>, <b>blocksize</b>,
<b>strip&minus;height</b>,
<b>disable&minus;double&minus;buffering</b>,
<b>disable&minus;backtracking</b>, and
<b>force&minus;wait</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options come in
two flavors: global and positional ones. Global options
apply to all devices managed by the backend whereas
positional options apply just to the most recently mentioned
device. Note that this means that the order in which the
options appear matters!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>linedistance&minus;fix</b> is positional and works around
a problem that occurs with some SCSI controllers (notably
the ncr810 controller under Linux). If color scans have
horizontal stripes and/or the colors are off, then
it&rsquo;s likely that your controller suffers from this
problem. Turning on this option usually fixes the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>lineart&minus;fix</b> is positional and works around a
timing problem that seems to exist with certain MFS-12000SP
scanners. The problem manifests itself in dropped lines when
scanning in lineart mode. Turning on this option should fix
the problem but may slow down scanning a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>legal&minus;size</b> is positional and sets the size of
the scan area to Legal format. Set this option if you own a
Paragon 12000 LS. It can&rsquo;t be distinguished by
software from a ScanExpress 12000 SP (ISO A4 format).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>buffersize</b> is a positional option that overrides the
default value set for the size of the SCSI buffer. The
buffer size is specified in kilobytes. The default value is
128. Because of double buffering the buffer actually sent to
the scanner is half the size of this value. Try to increase
this value to achieve higher scan speeds. Note that some
ScanExpress scanners don&rsquo;t like buffer sizes above 64
kb (buffersize = 128). If your sg driver can&rsquo;t set
SCSI buffer sizes at runtime you may have to change that
value, too. See sane&minus;scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>blocksize</b> is a positional option that overrides the
default value set for the maximum amount of data scanned in
one block. The buffer size is specified in kilobytes. Some
scanners freeze if this value is bigger than 2048. The
default value is 1 GB (so effectively no limit) for most
scanners. Don&rsquo;t change this value if you don&rsquo;t
know exactly what you do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>strip&minus;height</b> is a global option that limits the
maximum height of the strip scanned with a single SCSI read
command. The height is specified in inches and may contain a
fractional part (e.g., 1.5). Setting the strip&minus;height
to a small value (one inch, for example) reduces the
likelihood of encountering problems with SCSI driver
timeouts and/or timeouts with other devices on the same SCSI
bus. Unfortunately, it also increases scan times. With
current SCSI adapters and drivers this option
shouldn&rsquo;t be needed any more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>disable&minus;double&minus;buffering</b> is a global
option. If set, the backend will only send one buffer at a
time to the scanner. Try this option if you have trouble
while scanning, e.g. SCSI errors, freezes, or the first few
cm are repeated over and over again in your image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>disable&minus;backtracking</b> is a positional option. If
set, the scanner will not move back its slider after each
SCSI buffer is filled (&lsquo;backtracking&rsquo;). Setting
this option will lead to faster scans but may also produce
horizontal stripes. This option doesn&rsquo;t work with
every scanner (only some of the paragon models can modify
backtracking).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
<b>force&minus;wait</b> is a global option. If set, the
backend will wait until the device is ready before sending
the inquiry command. Further more the backend will force the
scan slider to return to its starting position (not
implemented for all scanners). This option may be necessary
with the 600 II N or when scanimage is used multiple times
(e.g. in scripts). The default is off (not set).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A sample
configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"># limit strip
height of all scanners to 1.5 inches: <br>
option strip&minus;height 1.5 <br>
/dev/scanner # first Mustek scanner <br>
# 1 MB buffer for /dev/scanner: <br>
option buffersize 1024 <br>
/dev/sge # second Mustek scanner <br>
# turn on fixes for /dev/sge: <br>
option lineart&minus;fix <br>
option linedistance&minus;fix</p>

<h2>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS
<a name="SCSI ADAPTER TIPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You need a SCSI
adapter for the SCSI scanners. Even if the connector is the
same as that of parallel port scanners, connecting it to the
computers parallel port will NOT work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mustek SCSI
scanners are typically delivered with an ISA SCSI adapter.
Unfortunately, that adapter is not worth much since it is
not interrupt driven. It is (sometimes) possible to get the
supplied card to work, but without interrupt line, scanning
will be very slow and put so much load on the system, that
it becomes almost unusable for other tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you already
have a working SCSI controller in your system, you should
consider that Mustek scanners do not support the SCSI-2
disconnect/reconnect protocol and hence tie up the SCSI bus
while a scan is in progress. This means that no other SCSI
device on the same bus can be accessed while a scan is in
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
Mustek-supplied adapter is not worth much and because Mustek
scanners do not support the SCSI-2 disconnect/reconnect
protocol, it is recommended to install a separate (cheap)
SCSI controller for Mustek scanners. For example, ncr810
based cards are known to work fine and cost as little as
fifty US dollars.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For Mustek
scanners, it is typically necessary to configure the
low-level SCSI driver to disable synchronous transfers (sync
negotiation), tagged command queuing, and target
disconnects. See <b>sane&minus;scsi</b>(5) for driver- and
platform-specific information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ScanExpress
models have sometimes trouble with high resolution color
mode. If you encounter sporadic corrupted images (parts
duplicated or shifted horizontally) kill all other
applications before scanning and (if sufficient memory is
available) disable swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Details on how
to get the Mustek SCSI adapters and other cards running can
be found at
<i>http://www.meier&minus;geinitz.de/sane/mustek&minus;backend/#SCSI</i>.</p>

<h2>PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS
<a name="PARALLEL PORT SCANNERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
has support for the Paragon 600 II EP and Paragon 600 II N
parallel port scanners. Note that the latter scanner comes
with its own ISA card that implements a funky parallel port
(in other words, the scanner does not connected to the
printer parallel port).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These scanners
can be configured by listing the port number of the adapter
or the parallel port in the mustek.conf file. Valid port
numbers for the 600 II N are <i>0x26b</i>, <i>0x2ab</i>,
<i>0x2eb</i>, <i>0x22b</i>, <i>0x32b</i>, <i>0x36b</i>,
<i>0x3ab</i>, <i>0x3eb</i>. For the 600 II EP use one of
these: <i>parport0</i>, <i>parport1</i>, <i>parport2</i>,
<i>0x378</i>, <i>0x278</i>, <i>0x3bc</i>. Pick one that
doesn&rsquo;t conflict with the other hardware in your
computer. Put only one number on a single line. Example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>0x3eb</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
these scanners usually root privileges are required to
access the I/O ports. Thus, either make frontends such as
<b>scanimage</b>(1) and <b>xscanimage</b>(1) setuid root
(generally not recommended for safety reasons) or,
alternatively, access this backend through the network
daemon <b>saned</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the Mustek
backend blocks while sending the inquiry command to the
scanner, add the option <b>force&minus;wait</b> to
<i>mustek.conf</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
after a while of no activity, some scanners themselves (not
the SANE backend) turns off their CCFL lamps. This shutdown
is not always perfect with the result that the lamp
sometimes continues to glow dimly at one end. This
doesn&rsquo;t appear to be dangerous since as soon as you
use the scanner again, the lamp turns back on to the normal
high brightness. However, the first image scanned after such
a shutdown may have stripes and appear to be over-exposed.
When this happens, just take another scan, and the image
will be fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the

separated by a colon (&lsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&lsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK</b></p>
