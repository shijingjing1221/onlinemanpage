NTP query program</p>

<h2>&nbsp;
<a name="&nbsp;"></a>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntpdc [
-46dilnps ] [ -c</b> <i>command</i> <b>] [</b> <i>host</i>
<b>] [ ... ]</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntpdc</b> is
used to query the <b>ntpd</b> daemon about its current state
and to request changes in that state. The program may be run
either in interactive mode or controlled using command line
arguments. Extensive state and statistics information is
available through the <b>ntpdc</b> interface. In addition,
nearly all the configuration options which can be specified
at startup using ntpd&rsquo;s configuration file may also be
specified at run time using <b>ntpdc</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one or more
request options are included on the command line when
<b>ntpdc</b> is executed, each of the requests will be sent
to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as
command line arguments, or on localhost by default. If no
request options are given, <b>ntpdc</b> will attempt to read
commands from the standard input and execute these on the
NTP server running on the first host given on the command
line, again defaulting to localhost when no other host is
specified. <b>ntpdc</b> will prompt for commands if the
standard input is a terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntpdc</b>
uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the NTP server,
and hence can be used to query any compatible server on the
network which permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP
protocol this communication will be somewhat unreliable,
especially over large distances in terms of network
topology. <b>ntpdc</b> makes no attempt to retransmit
requests, and will time requests out if the remote host is
not heard from within a suitable timeout time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The operation
of <b>ntpdc</b> are specific to the particular
implementation of the <b>ntpd</b> daemon and can be expected
to work only with this and maybe some previous versions of
the daemon. Requests from a remote <b>ntpdc</b> program
which affect the state of the local server must be
authenticated, which requires both the remote program and
local server share a common key and key identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
contexts where a host name is expected, a <b>-4</b>
qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to
the IPv4 namespace, while a <b>-6</b> qualifier forces DNS
resolution to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
<a name="COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying a
command line option other than <b>-i</b> or <b>-n</b> will
cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the
indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise, <b>ntpdc</b> will
attempt to read interactive format commands from the
standard input.</p>

<h2>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
<a name="INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interactive
format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to
four arguments. Only enough characters of the full keyword
to uniquely identify the command need be typed. The output
of a command is normally sent to the standard output, but
optionally the output of individual commands may be sent to
a file by appending a <b>&lt;</b>, followed by a file name,
to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A number of
interactive format commands are executed entirely within the
<b>ntpdc</b> program itself and do not result in NTP mode 7
requests being sent to a server. These are described
following. <b><br>
? [</b> <i>command_keyword</i> <b>] <br>
help [</b> <i>command_keyword</i> <b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A <b>?</b> by itself will print
a list of all the command keywords known to this incarnation
of <b>ntpq</b>. A <b>?</b> followed by a command keyword
will print function and usage information about the command.
This command is probably a better source of information
about <b>ntpq</b> than this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delay</b>
<i>milliseconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specify a time interval to be
added to timestamps included in requests which require
authentication. This is used to enable (unreliable) server
reconfiguration over long delay network paths or between
machines whose clocks are unsynchronized. Actually the
server does not now require timestamps in authenticated
requests, so this command may be obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>host</b> <i>hostname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Set the host to which future
queries will be sent. Hostname may be either a host name or
a numeric address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hostnames [ yes | no
]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If <b>yes</b> is specified,
host names are printed in information displays. If <b>no</b>
is specified, numeric addresses are printed instead. The
default is <b>yes</b>, unless modified using the command
line <b>-n</b> switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>keyid</b> <i>keyid</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command allows the
specification of a key number to be used to authenticate
configuration requests from ntpdc to the host(s). This must
correspond to a key number which the host/server has been
configured to use for this purpose (server options:
<b>trustedkey</b>, and <b>requestkey</b>). If authentication
is not enabled on the host(s) for ntpdc commands, the
command <b>&quot;keyid 0&quot;</b> should be given;
otherwise the <i>keyid</i> of the next subsequent
<b>addpeer/addserver/broadcast</b> command will be used.</p>

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>passwd</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>This command prompts you to type in a password (which
will not be echoed) which will be used to authenticate
configuration requests. The password must correspond to the
key configured for use by the NTP server for this purpose if
such requests are to be successful.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>timeout</b>
<i>milliseconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Specify a timeout period for
responses to server queries. The default is about 8000
milliseconds. Note that since <b>ntpdc</b> retries each
query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for a
timeout will be twice the timeout value set.</p>

<h2>CONTROL MESSAGE COMMANDS
<a name="CONTROL MESSAGE COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Query commands
result in NTP mode 7 packets containing requests for
information being sent to the server. These are read-only
commands in that they make no modification of the server
configuration state. <b><br>
listpeers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Obtains and prints a brief list
of the peers for which the server is maintaining state.
These should include all configured peer associations as
well as those peers whose stratum is such that they are
considered by the server to be possible future
synchronization candidates.</p>

<p><b>peers</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>

<p>Obtains a list of peers for which the server is
maintaining state, along with a summary of that state.
Summary information includes the address of the remote peer,
the local interface address (0.0.0.0 if a local address has
yet to be determined), the stratum of the remote peer (a
stratum of 16 indicates the remote peer is unsynchronized),
the polling interval, in seconds, the reachability register,
in octal, and the current estimated delay, offset and
dispersion of the peer, all in seconds. The character in the
left margin indicates the mode this peer entry is operating
in. A <b>+</b> denotes symmetric active, a <b>-</b>
indicates symmetric passive, a <b>=</b> means the remote
server is being polled in client mode, a <b>^</b> indicates
that the server is broadcasting to this address, a <b>~</b>
denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and a
<b>*</b> marks the peer the server is currently
synchronizing to.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Print the values of selected
loop filter variables. The loop filter is the part of NTP
which deals with adjusting the local system clock. The
<b>offset</b> is the last offset given to the loop filter by
the packet processing code. The <b>frequency</b> is the
frequency error of the local clock in parts-per-million
(ppm). The <b>time_const</b> controls the stiffness of the
phase-lock loop and thus the speed at which it can adapt to
oscillator drift. The <b>watchdog timer</b> value is the
number of seconds which have elapsed since the last sample
offset was given to the loop filter. The <b>oneline</b> and
<b>multiline</b> options specify the format in which this
information is to be printed, with <b>multiline</b> as the
default.</p>

<h2>RUNTIME CONFIGURATION REQUESTS
<a name="RUNTIME CONFIGURATION REQUESTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All requests
which cause state changes in the server are authenticated by
the server using a configured NTP key (the facility can also
be disabled by the server by not configuring a key). The key
number and the corresponding key must also be made known to
<b>ntpdc</b>. This can be done using the keyid and passwd
commands, the latter of which will prompt at the terminal
for a password to use as the encryption key. You will also
be prompted automatically for both the key number and
password the first time a command which would result in an
authenticated request to the server is given. Authentication
not only provides verification that the requester has
permission to make such changes, but also gives an extra
degree of protection again transmission errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authenticated
requests always include a timestamp in the packet data,
which is included in the computation of the authentication
code. This timestamp is compared by the server to its
receive time stamp. If they differ by more than a small
amount the request is rejected. This is done for two
reasons. First, it makes simple replay attacks on the
server, by someone who might be able to overhear traffic on
your LAN, much more difficult. Second, it makes it more
difficult to request configuration changes to your server
from topologically remote hosts. While the reconfiguration
facility will work well with a server on the local host, and
may work adequately between time-synchronized hosts on the
same LAN, it will work very poorly for more distant hosts.
As such, if reasonable passwords are chosen, care is taken
in the distribution and protection of keys and appropriate
source address restrictions are applied, the run time
reconfiguration facility should provide an adequate level of
security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
commands all make authenticated requests. <b><br>
addpeer</b> <i>peer_address</i> <b>[</b> <i>keyid</i> <b>]
[</b> <i>version</i> <b>] [ minpoll# | prefer | iburst <br>
| burst | minpoll</b> <i>N</i> <b>| maxpoll</b> <i>N</i>

| minpoll</b> <i>N</i> <b>| maxpoll</b> <i>N</i> <b><br>
| keyid</b><i>N</i> <b>| version</b> <i>N</i> <b>[...]
]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Add a configured peer
association at the given address and operating in symmetric
active mode. Note that an existing association with the same
peer may be deleted when this command is executed, or may
simply be converted to conform to the new configuration, as
appropriate. If the <b>keyid</b> is nonzero, all outgoing
packets to the remote server will have an authentication
field attached encrypted with this key. If the value is 0
(or not given) no authentication will be done. If
ntpdc&rsquo;s key number has not yet been set (<i>e.g.,</i>
by the keyid command), it will be set to this value. The
<b>version#</b> can be 1 through 4 and defaults to 3. The
remaining options are either a numeric value for
<b>minpoll</b> or literals <b>prefer</b>, <b>iburst</b>,
<b>burst</b>, <b>minpoll</b> <i>N</i>, <b>keyid</b>
<i>N</i>, <b>version</b> <i>N</i>, or <b>maxpoll</b>
<i>N</i> (where <i>N</i> is a numeric value), and have the
action as specified in the <b>peer</b> configuration file
command of ntpd. See the Server Options page for further
information. Each flag (or its absence) replaces the
previous setting. The <b>prefer</b> keyword indicates a
preferred peer (and thus will be used primarily for clock
synchronisation if possible). The preferred peer also
determines the validity of the PPS signal - if the preferred
peer is suitable for synchronisation so is the PPS signal.
The <b>dynamic</b> keyword allows association configuration
even when no suitable network interface is found at
configuration time. The dynamic interface update mechanism
may complete the configuration when new interfaces appear
(e.g. WLAN/PPP interfaces) at a later time and thus render
the association operable.</p>

<i>peer_address</i> <b>[</b> <i>keyid</i> <b>] [</b>
<i>version</i> <b>] [</b> <i>prefer</i> <b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Identical to the addpeer
command, except that the operating mode is broadcast. In
this case a valid non-zero key identifier and key are
required. The <b>peer_address</b> parameter can be the
broadcast address of the local network or a multicast group
address assigned to NTP. If a multicast address, a
multicast-capable kernel is required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>unconfig</b>
<i>peer_address</i> <b>[...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command causes the
configured bit to be removed from the specified peer(s). In
many cases this will cause the peer association to be
deleted. When appropriate, however, the association may
persist in an unconfigured mode if the remote peer is
willing to continue on in this fashion.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntpdc</b> is
a crude hack. Much of the information it shows is deadly
boring and could only be loved by its implementer. The
program was designed so that new (and temporary) features
were easy to hack in, at great expense to the
program&rsquo;s ease of use. Despite this, the program is
occasionally useful.</p>
