<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Nmap
(&ldquo;Network Mapper&rdquo;) is an open source tool for
network exploration and security auditing. It was designed
to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine
against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways
to determine what hosts are available on the network, what
services (application name and version) those hosts are
offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are
running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use,
and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly
used for security audits, many systems and network
administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as
network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and
monitoring host or service uptime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output from
Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental
information on each depending on the options used. Key among
that information is the &ldquo;interesting ports
table&rdquo;.. That table lists the port number and
protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open,
filtered, closed, or unfiltered. Open. means that an
application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port. Filtered. means that a
firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the
port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed.
Closed. ports have no application listening on them, though
they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as
unfiltered. when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but
Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap
reports the state combinations open|filtered. and
closed|filtered. when it cannot determine which of the two
states describe a port. The port table may also include
software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(<b>&minus;sO</b>), Nmap provides information on supported
IP protocols rather than listening ports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further
information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typical Nmap
scan is shown in Example&nbsp;1. The only Nmap arguments
used in this example are <b>&minus;A</b>, to enable OS and
version detection, script scanning, and traceroute;
<b>&minus;T4</b> for faster execution; and then the two
target hostnames.</p>

<h2>TARGET SPECIFICATION
<a name="TARGET SPECIFICATION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Everything
on the Nmap command&minus;line that isn't an option (or
option argument) is treated as a target host specification.
The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or
hostname for scanning.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Sometimes
you wish to scan a whole network of adjacent hosts. For
this, Nmap supports CIDR&minus;style. addressing. You can
append /<i>numbits</i> to an IPv4 address or hostname and
Nmap will scan every IP address for which the first
<i>numbits</i> are the same as for the reference IP or
hostname given. For example, 192.168.10.0/24 would scan the
256 hosts between 192.168.10.0 (binary: 11000000 10101000
00001010 00000000) and 192.168.10.255 (binary: 11000000
10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive. 192.168.10.40/24
would scan exactly the same targets. Given that the host
scanme.nmap.org. is at the IP address 64.13.134.52, the
specification scanme.nmap.org/16 would scan the 65,536 IP
addresses between 64.13.0.0 and 64.13.255.255. The smallest
allowed value is /0, which targets the whole Internet. The
largest value is /32, which scans just the named host or IP
address because all address bits are fixed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">CIDR
notation is short but not always flexible enough. For
example, you might want to scan 192.168.0.0/16 but skip any
IPs ending with .0 or .255 because they may be used as
subnet network and broadcast addresses. Nmap supports this
through octet range addressing. Rather than specify a normal
IP address, you can specify a comma&minus;separated list of
numbers or ranges for each octet. For example,
192.168.0&minus;255.1&minus;254 will skip all addresses in
the range that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3&minus;5,7.1
will scan the four addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1,
192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1. Either side of a range may be
omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the
right. Using &minus; by itself is the same as 0&minus;255,
but remember to use 0&minus; in the first octet so the
target specification doesn't look like a command&minus;line
option. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the
specifier 0&minus;255.0&minus;255.13.37 will perform an
Internet&minus;wide scan for all IP addresses ending in
13.37. This sort of broad sampling can be useful for
Internet surveys and research.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">IPv6
addresses can only be specified by their fully qualified
IPv6 address or hostname. CIDR and octet ranges aren't yet
supported for IPv6.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">IPv6
addresses with non&minus;global scope need to have a zone ID
suffix. On Unix systems, this is a percent sign followed by
an interface name; a complete address might be
fe80::a8bb:ccff:fedd:eeff%eth0. On Windows, use an interface
index number in place of an interface name:
fe80::a8bb:ccff:fedd:eeff%1. You can see a list of interface
indexes by running the command <b>netsh.exe interface ipv6
show interface</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
accepts multiple host specifications on the command line,
and they don't need to be the same type. The command <b>nmap
scanme.nmap.org 192.168.0.0/8 10.0.0,1,3&minus;7.&minus;</b>
does what you would expect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
targets are usually specified on the command lines, the
following options are also available to control target
selection:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;iL</b>
<i>inputfilename</i> (Input from list) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Reads
target specifications from <i>inputfilename</i>. Passing a
huge list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet
it is a common desire. For example, your DHCP server might
export a list of 10,000 current leases that you wish to
scan. Or maybe you want to scan all IP addresses
<i>except</i> for those to locate hosts using unauthorized
static IP addresses. Simply generate the list of hosts to
scan and pass that filename to Nmap as an argument to the
<b>&minus;iL</b> option. Entries can be in any of the
formats accepted by Nmap on the command line (IP address,
hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or octet ranges). Each entry must be
separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines. You can
specify a hyphen (&minus;) as the filename if you want Nmap
to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual
file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
input file may contain comments that start with # and extend
to the end of the line.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;iR</b>
<i>num hosts</i> (Choose random targets) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">For
Internet&minus;wide surveys and other research, you may want
to choose targets at random. The <i>num hosts</i> argument
tells Nmap how many IPs to generate. Undesirable IPs such as
those in certain private, multicast, or unallocated address
ranges are automatically skipped. The argument 0 can be
specified for a never&minus;ending scan. Keep in mind that
some network administrators bristle at unauthorized scans of
their networks and may complain. Use this option at your own
risk! If you find yourself really bored one rainy afternoon,
try the command <b>nmap &minus;Pn &minus;sS &minus;p 80
&minus;iR 0 &minus;&minus;open</b>. to locate random web
servers for browsing.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;exclude</b>
<i>host1</i><b>[,</b><i>host2</i>[,...]] (Exclude
hosts/networks) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specifies
a comma&minus;separated list of targets to be excluded from
the scan even if they are part of the overall network range
you specify. The list you pass in uses normal Nmap syntax,
so it can include hostnames, CIDR netblocks, octet ranges,
etc. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan
includes untouchable mission&minus;critical servers, systems
that are known to react adversely to port scans, or subnets
administered by other people.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;excludefile</b>
<i>exclude_file</i> (Exclude list from file) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
offers the same functionality as the
<b>&minus;&minus;exclude</b> option, except that the
excluded targets are provided in a newline&minus;,
space&minus;, or tab&minus;delimited <i>exclude_file</i>
rather than on the command line.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
exclude file may contain comments that start with # and
extend to the end of the line.</font></p>

<h2>HOST DISCOVERY
<a name="HOST DISCOVERY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">One
of the very first steps in any network reconnaissance
mission is to reduce a (sometimes huge) set of IP ranges
into a list of active or interesting hosts. Scanning every
port of every single IP address is slow and usually
unnecessary. Of course what makes a host interesting depends
greatly on the scan purposes. Network administrators may
only be interested in hosts running a certain service, while
security auditors may care about every single device with an
IP address. An administrator may be comfortable using just
an ICMP ping to locate hosts on his internal network, while
an external penetration tester may use a diverse set of
dozens of probes in an attempt to evade firewall
restrictions.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Because
host discovery needs are so diverse, Nmap offers a wide
variety of options for customizing the techniques used. Host
discovery is sometimes called ping scan, but it goes well
beyond the simple ICMP echo request packets associated with
the ubiquitous ping tool. Users can skip the ping step
entirely with a list scan (<b>&minus;sL</b>) or by disabling
ping (<b>&minus;Pn</b>), or engage the network with
arbitrary combinations of multi&minus;port TCP SYN/ACK, UDP,
SCTP INIT and ICMP probes. The goal of these probes is to
solicit responses which demonstrate that an IP address is
actually active (is being used by a host or network device).
On many networks, only a small percentage of IP addresses
are active at any given time. This is particularly common
with private address space such as 10.0.0.0/8. That network
has 16 million IPs, but I have seen it used by companies
with less than a thousand machines. Host discovery can find
those machines in a sparsely allocated sea of IP
addresses.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
no host discovery options are given, Nmap sends an ICMP echo
request, a TCP SYN packet to port 443, a TCP ACK packet to
port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request. (For IPv6, the ICMP
timestamp request is omitted because it is not part of
ICMPv6.) These defaults are equivalent to the <b>&minus;PE
&minus;PS443 &minus;PA80 &minus;PP</b> options. The
exceptions to this are the ARP (for IPv4) and Neighbor
Discovery. (for IPv6) scans which are used for any targets
on a local ethernet network. For unprivileged Unix shell
users, the default probes are a SYN packet to ports 80 and
443 using the <b>connect</b> system call.. This host
discovery is often sufficient when scanning local networks,
but a more comprehensive set of discovery probes is
recommended for security auditing.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>&minus;P*</b> options (which select ping types) can be
combined. You can increase your odds of penetrating strict
firewalls by sending many probe types using different TCP
ports/flags and ICMP codes. Also note that ARP/Neighbor
Discovery (<b>&minus;PR</b>). is done by default against
targets on a local ethernet network even if you specify
other <b>&minus;P*</b> options, because it is almost always
faster and more effective.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">By
default, Nmap does host discovery and then performs a port
scan against each host it determines is online. This is true
even if you specify non&minus;default host discovery types
such as UDP probes (<b>&minus;PU</b>). Read about the
<b>&minus;sn</b> option to learn how to perform only host
discovery, or use <b>&minus;Pn</b> to skip host discovery
and port scan all target hosts. The following options
control host discovery:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sL</b>
(List Scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The list
scan is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply
lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending
any packets to the target hosts. By default, Nmap still does
reverse&minus;DNS resolution on the hosts to learn their
names. It is often surprising how much useful information
simple hostnames give out. For example, fw.chi is the name
of one company's Chicago firewall. Nmap also reports the
total number of IP addresses at the end. The list scan is a
good sanity check to ensure that you have proper IP
addresses for your targets. If the hosts sport domain names
you do not recognize, it is worth investigating further to
prevent scanning the wrong company's network.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Since
the idea is to simply print a list of target hosts, options
for higher level functionality such as port scanning, OS
detection, or ping scanning cannot be combined with this. If
you wish to disable ping scanning while still performing
such higher level functionality, read up on the
<b>&minus;Pn</b> (skip ping) option.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sn</b>
(No port scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host
discovery, and only print out the available hosts that
responded to the scan. This is often known as a &ldquo;ping
scan&rdquo;, but you can also request that traceroute and
NSE host scripts be run. This is by default one step more
intrusive than the list scan, and can often be used for the
same purposes. It allows light reconnaissance of a target
network without attracting much attention. Knowing how many
hosts are up is more valuable to attackers than the list
provided by list scan of every single IP and host
name.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Systems
administrators often find this option valuable as well. It
can easily be used to count available machines on a network
or monitor server availability. This is often called a ping
sweep, and is more reliable than pinging the broadcast
address because many hosts do not reply to broadcast
queries.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
default host discovery done with <b>&minus;sn</b> consists
of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to
port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default. When
executed by an unprivileged user, only SYN packets are sent
(using a <b>connect</b> call) to ports 80 and 443 on the
target. When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a
local ethernet network, ARP requests are used unless
<b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;ip</b> was specified. The
<b>&minus;sn</b> option can be combined with any of the
discovery probe types (the <b>&minus;P*</b> options,
excluding <b>&minus;Pn</b>) for greater flexibility. If any
of those probe type and port number options are used, the
default probes are overridden. When strict firewalls are in
place between the source host running Nmap and the target
network, using those advanced techniques is recommended.
Otherwise hosts could be missed when the firewall drops
probes or their responses.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
previous releases of Nmap, <b>&minus;sn</b> was known as
<b>&minus;sP</b>..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;Pn</b>
(No ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option skips the Nmap discovery stage altogether. Normally,
Nmap uses this stage to determine active machines for
heavier scanning. By default, Nmap only performs heavy
probing such as port scans, version detection, or OS
detection against hosts that are found to be up. Disabling
host discovery with <b>&minus;Pn</b> causes Nmap to attempt
the requested scanning functions against <i>every</i> target
IP address specified. So if a class B target address space
(/16) is specified on the command line, all 65,536 IP
addresses are scanned. Proper host discovery is skipped as
with the list scan, but instead of stopping and printing the
target list, Nmap continues to perform requested functions
as if each target IP is active. To skip ping scan <i>and</i>
port scan, while still allowing NSE to run, use the two
options <b>&minus;Pn &minus;sn</b> together.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
machines on a local ethernet network, ARP scanning will
still be performed (unless
<b>&minus;&minus;disable&minus;arp&minus;ping</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;ip</b> is specified) because
Nmap needs MAC addresses to further scan target hosts. In
previous versions of Nmap, <b>&minus;Pn</b> was
<b>&minus;P0</b>. and <b>&minus;PN</b>..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PS</b>
<i>port list</i> (TCP SYN Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option sends an empty TCP packet with the SYN flag set. The
default destination port is 80 (configurable at compile time
by changing <i>DEFAULT_TCP_PROBE_PORT_SPEC</i>. in nmap.h)..
Alternate ports can be specified as a parameter. The syntax
is the same as for the <b>&minus;p</b> except that port type
specifiers like T: are not allowed. Examples are
<b>&minus;PS22</b> and
<b>&minus;PS22&minus;25,80,113,1050,35000</b>. Note that
there can be no space between <b>&minus;PS</b> and the port
list. If multiple probes are specified they will be sent in
parallel.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
SYN flag suggests to the remote system that you are
attempting to establish a connection. Normally the
destination port will be closed, and a RST (reset) packet
sent back. If the port happens to be open, the target will
take the second step of a TCP
three&minus;way&minus;handshake. by responding with a
SYN/ACK TCP packet. The machine running Nmap then tears down
the nascent connection by responding with a RST rather than
sending an ACK packet which would complete the
three&minus;way&minus;handshake and establish a full
connection. The RST packet is sent by the kernel of the
machine running Nmap in response to the unexpected SYN/ACK,
not by Nmap itself.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
does not care whether the port is open or closed. Either the
RST or SYN/ACK response discussed previously tell Nmap that
the host is available and responsive.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">On
Unix boxes, only the privileged user root. is generally able
to send and receive raw TCP packets.. For unprivileged
users, a workaround is automatically employed. whereby the
<b>connect</b> system call is initiated against each target
port. This has the effect of sending a SYN packet to the
target host, in an attempt to establish a connection. If
<b>connect</b> returns with a quick success or an
ECONNREFUSED failure, the underlying TCP stack must have
received a SYN/ACK or RST and the host is marked available.
If the connection attempt is left hanging until a timeout is
reached, the host is marked as down.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PA</b>
<i>port list</i> (TCP ACK Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The TCP
ACK ping is quite similar to the just&minus;discussed SYN
ping. The difference, as you could likely guess, is that the
TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK
packet purports to be acknowledging data over an established
TCP connection, but no such connection exists. So remote
hosts should always respond with a RST packet, disclosing
their existence in the process.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>&minus;PA</b> option uses the same default port as the
SYN probe (80) and can also take a list of destination ports
in the same format. If an unprivileged user tries this, the
<b>connect</b> workaround discussed previously is used. This
workaround is imperfect because <b>connect</b> is actually
sending a SYN packet rather than an ACK.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
reason for offering both SYN and ACK ping probes is to
maximize the chances of bypassing firewalls. Many
administrators configure routers and other simple firewalls
to block incoming SYN packets except for those destined for
public services like the company web site or mail server.
This prevents other incoming connections to the
organization, while allowing users to make unobstructed
outgoing connections to the Internet. This
non&minus;stateful approach takes up few resources on the
firewall/router and is widely supported by hardware and
software filters. The Linux Netfilter/iptables. firewall
software offers the <b>&minus;&minus;syn</b> convenience
option to implement this stateless approach. When stateless
firewall rules such as this are in place, SYN ping probes
(<b>&minus;PS</b>) are likely to be blocked when sent to
closed target ports. In such cases, the ACK probe shines as
it cuts right through these rules.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Another
common type of firewall uses stateful rules that drop
unexpected packets. This feature was initially found mostly
on high&minus;end firewalls, though it has become much more
common over the years. The Linux Netfilter/iptables system
supports this through the <b>&minus;&minus;state</b> option,
which categorizes packets based on connection state. A SYN
probe is more likely to work against such a system, as
unexpected ACK packets are generally recognized as bogus and
dropped. A solution to this quandary is to send both SYN and
ACK probes by specifying <b>&minus;PS</b> and
<b>&minus;PA</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PU</b>
<i>port list</i> (UDP Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Another
host discovery option is the UDP ping, which sends a UDP
packet to the given ports. For most ports, the packet will
be empty, though for a few a protocol&minus;specific payload
will be sent that is more likely to get a response.. The
<b>&minus;&minus;data&minus;length</b>. option can be used
to send a fixed&minus;length random payload to every port or
(if you specify a value of 0) to disable payloads. You can
also disable payloads by specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;data&minus;length 0</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
port list takes the same format as with the previously
discussed <b>&minus;PS</b> and <b>&minus;PA</b> options. If
no ports are specified, the default is 40125.. This default
can be configured at compile&minus;time by changing
<i>DEFAULT_UDP_PROBE_PORT_SPEC</i>. in nmap.h.. A highly
uncommon port is used by default because sending to open
ports is often undesirable for this particular scan
type.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Upon
hitting a closed port on the target machine, the UDP probe
should elicit an ICMP port unreachable packet in return.
This signifies to Nmap that the machine is up and available.
Many other types of ICMP errors, such as host/network
unreachables or TTL exceeded are indicative of a down or
unreachable host. A lack of response is also interpreted
this way. If an open port is reached, most services simply
ignore the empty packet and fail to return any response.
This is why the default probe port is 40125, which is highly
unlikely to be in use. A few services, such as the Character
Generator (chargen) protocol, will respond to an empty UDP
packet, and thus disclose to Nmap that the machine is
available.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
primary advantage of this scan type is that it bypasses
firewalls and filters that only screen TCP. For example, I
once owned a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless broadband router. The
external interface of this device filtered all TCP ports by
default, but UDP probes would still elicit port unreachable
messages and thus give away the device.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PY</b>
<i>port list</i> (SCTP INIT Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option sends an SCTP packet containing a minimal INIT chunk.
The default destination port is 80 (configurable at compile
time by changing <i>DEFAULT_SCTP_PROBE_PORT_SPEC</i>. in
nmap.h). Alternate ports can be specified as a parameter.
The syntax is the same as for the <b>&minus;p</b> except
that port type specifiers like S: are not allowed. Examples
are <b>&minus;PY22</b> and <b>&minus;PY22,80,179,5060</b>.
Note that there can be no space between <b>&minus;PY</b> and
the port list. If multiple probes are specified they will be
sent in parallel.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
INIT chunk suggests to the remote system that you are
attempting to establish an association. Normally the
destination port will be closed, and an ABORT chunk will be
sent back. If the port happens to be open, the target will
take the second step of an SCTP
four&minus;way&minus;handshake. by responding with an
INIT&minus;ACK chunk. If the machine running Nmap has a
functional SCTP stack, then it tears down the nascent
association by responding with an ABORT chunk rather than
sending a COOKIE&minus;ECHO chunk which would be the next
step in the four&minus;way&minus;handshake. The ABORT packet
is sent by the kernel of the machine running Nmap in
response to the unexpected INIT&minus;ACK, not by Nmap
itself.</font></p>

.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">In
addition to the unusual TCP, UDP and SCTP host discovery
types discussed previously, Nmap can send the standard
packets sent by the ubiquitous ping program. Nmap sends an
ICMP type 8 (echo request) packet to the target IP
addresses, expecting a type 0 (echo reply) in return from
available hosts.. Unfortunately for network explorers, many
hosts and firewalls now block these packets, rather than
responding as required by</font>

forgetting that other ICMP queries can be used for the same
purpose.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PO</b>
<i>protocol list</i> (IP Protocol Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">One of
the newer host discovery options is the IP protocol ping,
which sends IP packets with the specified protocol number
set in their IP header. The protocol list takes the same
format as do port lists in the previously discussed TCP, UDP
and SCTP host discovery options. If no protocols are
specified, the default is to send multiple IP packets for
ICMP (protocol 1), IGMP (protocol 2), and
IP&minus;in&minus;IP (protocol 4). The default protocols can
be configured at compile&minus;time by changing
<i>DEFAULT_PROTO_PROBE_PORT_SPEC</i>. in nmap.h. Note that
for the ICMP, IGMP, TCP (protocol 6), UDP (protocol 17) and
SCTP (protocol 132), the packets are sent with the proper
protocol headers. while other protocols are sent with no
additional data beyond the IP header (unless the

specified).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
host discovery method looks for either responses using the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;PR</b>
(ARP Ping) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">One of
the most common Nmap usage scenarios is to scan an ethernet
LAN. On most LANs, especially those using private address
ranges specified by</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">RFC
1918</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[5]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">, the vast majority of IP addresses
are unused at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw
IP packet such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system
must determine the destination hardware (ARP) address
corresponding to the target IP so that it can properly
address the ethernet frame. This is often slow and
problematic, since operating systems weren't written with
the expectation that they would need to do millions of ARP
requests against unavailable hosts in a short time
period.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">ARP
scan puts Nmap and its optimized algorithms in charge of ARP
requests. And if it gets a response back, Nmap doesn't even
need to worry about the IP&minus;based ping packets since it
already knows the host is up. This makes ARP scan much
faster and more reliable than IP&minus;based scans. So it is
done by default when scanning ethernet hosts that Nmap
detects are on a local ethernet network. Even if different
ping types (such as <b>&minus;PE</b> or <b>&minus;PS</b>)
are specified, Nmap uses ARP instead for any of the targets
which are on the same LAN. If you absolutely don't want to
do an ARP scan, specify
<b>&minus;&minus;disable&minus;arp&minus;ping</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For

of locally connected ethernet hosts, even if other host

(Trace path to host) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Traceroutes
are performed post&minus;scan using information from the
scan results to determine the port and protocol most likely
to reach the target. It works with all scan types except
connect scans (<b>&minus;sT</b>) and idle scans
(<b>&minus;sI</b>). All traces use Nmap's dynamic timing
model and are performed in parallel.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Traceroute
works by sending packets with a low TTL
(time&minus;to&minus;live) in an attempt to elicit ICMP Time
Exceeded messages from intermediate hops between the scanner
and the target host. Standard traceroute implementations
start with a TTL of 1 and increment the TTL until the
destination host is reached. Nmap's traceroute starts with a
high TTL and then decrements the TTL until it reaches zero.
Doing it backwards lets Nmap employ clever caching
algorithms to speed up traces over multiple hosts. On
average Nmap sends 5&ndash;10 fewer packets per host,
depending on network conditions. If a single subnet is being
scanned (i.e. 192.168.0.0/24) Nmap may only have to send two
packets to most hosts.</font></p>

scan. Using multiple DNS servers is often faster, especially
if you choose authoritative servers for your target IP
space. This option can also improve stealth, as your
requests can be bounced off just about any recursive DNS
server on the Internet.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option also comes in handy when scanning private networks.
Sometimes only a few name servers provide proper rDNS
information, and you may not even know where they are. You
can scan the network for port 53 (perhaps with version
detection), then try Nmap list scans (<b>&minus;sL</b>)
specifying each name server one at a time with
<b>&minus;&minus;dns&minus;servers</b> until you find one
which works.</font></p>

<h2>PORT SCANNING BASICS
<a name="PORT SCANNING BASICS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
Nmap has grown in functionality over the years, it began as
an efficient port scanner, and that remains its core
function. The simple command <b>nmap</b> <i>target</i> scans
1,000 TCP ports on the host <i>target</i>. While many port
scanners have traditionally lumped all ports into the open
or closed states, Nmap is much more granular. It divides
ports into six states: open, closed, filtered, unfiltered,
open|filtered, or closed|filtered.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
states are not intrinsic properties of the port itself, but
describe how Nmap sees them. For example, an Nmap scan from
the same network as the target may show port 135/tcp as
open, while a scan at the same time with the same options
from across the Internet might show that port as
filtered.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>The
six port states recognized by Nmap</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">An
application is actively accepting TCP connections, UDP
datagrams or SCTP associations on this port. Finding these
is often the primary goal of port scanning.
Security&minus;minded people know that each open port is an
avenue for attack. Attackers and pen&minus;testers want to
exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or
protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate
users. Open ports are also interesting for
non&minus;security scans because they show services
available for use on the network.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A
closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap
probe packets), but there is no application listening on it.
They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP
address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of
OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, it may be
worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators
may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall.
Then they would appear in the filtered state, discussed
next.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
cannot determine whether the port is open because packet
filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The
filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router
rules, or host&minus;based firewall software. These ports
frustrate attackers because they provide so little
information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages
such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable:
communication administratively prohibited), but filters that
simply drop probes without responding are far more common.
This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the
probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than
filtering. This slows down the scan dramatically.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap
is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only
the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets,
classifies ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports
with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN
scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
places ports in this state when it is unable to determine
whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan
types in which open ports give no response. The lack of
response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the
probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for
sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP
protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this
way.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
state is used when Nmap is unable to determine whether a
port is closed or filtered. It is only used for the IP ID
idle scan.</font></p>

<h2>PORT SCANNING TECHNIQUES
<a name="PORT SCANNING TECHNIQUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">As
a novice performing automotive repair, I can struggle for
hours trying to fit my rudimentary tools (hammer, duct tape,
wrench, etc.) to the task at hand. When I fail miserably and
tow my jalopy to a real mechanic, he invariably fishes
around in a huge tool chest until pulling out the perfect
gizmo which makes the job seem effortless. The art of port
scanning is similar. Experts understand the dozens of scan
techniques and choose the appropriate one (or combination)
for a given task. Inexperienced users and script kiddies,.
on the other hand, try to solve every problem with the
default SYN scan. Since Nmap is free, the only barrier to
port scanning mastery is knowledge. That certainly beats the
automotive world, where it may take great skill to determine
that you need a strut spring compressor, then you still have
to pay thousands of dollars for it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Most
of the scan types are only available to privileged users..
This is because they send and receive raw packets,. which
requires root access on Unix systems. Using an administrator
account on Windows is recommended, though Nmap sometimes
works for unprivileged users on that platform when WinPcap
has already been loaded into the OS. Requiring root
privileges was a serious limitation when Nmap was released
in 1997, as many users only had access to shared shell
accounts. Now, the world is different. Computers are
cheaper, far more people have always&minus;on direct
Internet access, and desktop Unix systems (including Linux
and Mac OS X) are prevalent. A Windows version of Nmap is
now available, allowing it to run on even more desktops. For
all these reasons, users have less need to run Nmap from
limited shared shell accounts. This is fortunate, as the
privileged options make Nmap far more powerful and
flexible.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
Nmap attempts to produce accurate results, keep in mind that
all of its insights are based on packets returned by the
target machines (or firewalls in front of them). Such hosts
may be untrustworthy and send responses intended to confuse
or mislead Nmap. Much more common are
non&minus;RFC&minus;compliant hosts that do not respond as
they should to Nmap probes. FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans are
particularly susceptible to this problem. Such issues are
specific to certain scan types and so are discussed in the
individual scan type entries.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
section documents the dozen or so port scan techniques
supported by Nmap. Only one method may be used at a time,
except that UDP scan (<b>&minus;sU</b>) and any one of the
SCTP scan types (<b>&minus;sY</b>, <b>&minus;sZ</b>) may be
combined with any one of the TCP scan types. As a memory
aid, port scan type options are of the form
<b>&minus;s</b><i>C</i>, where <i>C</i> is a prominent
character in the scan name, usually the first. The one
exception to this is the deprecated FTP bounce scan
(<b>&minus;b</b>). By default, Nmap performs a SYN Scan,
though it substitutes a connect scan if the user does not
have proper privileges to send raw packets (requires root
access on Unix). Of the scans listed in this section,
unprivileged users can only execute connect and FTP bounce
scans.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sS</b>
(TCP SYN scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">SYN scan
is the default and most popular scan option for good
reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of
ports per second on a fast network not hampered by
restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and
stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. SYN scan
works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending
on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's
FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows
clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed,
and filtered states.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
technique is often referred to as half&minus;open scanning,
because you don't open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN
packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and
then wait for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is
listening (open), while a RST (reset) is indicative of a
non&minus;listener. If no response is received after several
retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is
also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3,
code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received. The port is also
considered open if a SYN packet (without the ACK flag) is
received in response. This can be due to an extremely rare
TCP feature known as a simultaneous open or split handshake
connection (see</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/misc/split-handshake.pdf</font></b><font color="#000000">).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sT</b>
(TCP connect scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">TCP
connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is
not an option. This is the case when a user does not have
raw packet privileges. Instead of writing raw packets as
most other scan types do, Nmap asks the underlying operating
system to establish a connection with the target machine and
port by issuing the <b>connect</b> system call. This is the
same high&minus;level system call that web browsers, P2P
clients, and most other network&minus;enabled applications
use to establish a connection. It is part of a programming
interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. Rather than
read raw packet responses off the wire, Nmap uses this API
to obtain status information on each connection
attempt.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
SYN scan is available, it is usually a better choice. Nmap
has less control over the high level <b>connect</b> call
than with raw packets, making it less efficient. The system
call completes connections to open target ports rather than
performing the half&minus;open reset that SYN scan does. Not
only does this take longer and require more packets to
obtain the same information, but target machines are more
likely to log the connection. A decent IDS will catch
either, but most machines have no such alarm system. Many
services on your average Unix system will add a note to
syslog, and sometimes a cryptic error message, when Nmap
connects and then closes the connection without sending
data. Truly pathetic services crash when this happens,
though that is uncommon. An administrator who sees a bunch
of connection attempts in her logs from a single system
should know that she has been connect scanned.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sU</b>
(UDP scans) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">While
most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP
protocol,</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">UDP</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[6]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">services are widely deployed. DNS,
SNMP, and DHCP (registered ports 53, 161/162, and 67/68) are
three of the most common. Because UDP scanning is generally
slower and more difficult than TCP, some security auditors
ignore these ports. This is a mistake, as exploitable UDP
services are quite common and attackers certainly don't
ignore the whole protocol. Fortunately, Nmap can help
inventory UDP ports.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">UDP
scan is activated with the <b>&minus;sU</b> option. It can
be combined with a TCP scan type such as SYN scan
(<b>&minus;sS</b>) to check both protocols during the same
run.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">UDP
scan works by sending a UDP packet to every targeted port.
For some common ports such as 53 and 161, a
protocol&minus;specific payload is sent, but for most ports
the packet is empty.. The
<b>&minus;&minus;data&minus;length</b> option can be used to
send a fixed&minus;length random payload to every port or
(if you specify a value of 0) to disable payloads. If an
ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned,
the port is closed. Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3,
codes 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13) mark the port as filtered.
Occasionally, a service will respond with a UDP packet,
proving that it is open. If no response is received after
retransmissions, the port is classified as open|filtered.
This means that the port could be open, or perhaps packet
filters are blocking the communication. Version detection
(<b>&minus;sV</b>) can be used to help differentiate the
truly open ports from the filtered ones.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A
big challenge with UDP scanning is doing it quickly. Open
and filtered ports rarely send any response, leaving Nmap to
time out and then conduct retransmissions just in case the
probe or response were lost. Closed ports are often an even
bigger problem. They usually send back an ICMP port
unreachable error. But unlike the RST packets sent by closed
TCP ports in response to a SYN or connect scan, many hosts
rate limit. ICMP port unreachable messages by default. Linux
and Solaris are particularly strict about this. For example,
the Linux 2.4.20 kernel limits destination unreachable
messages to one per second (in net/ipv4/icmp.c).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
detects rate limiting and slows down accordingly to avoid
flooding the network with useless packets that the target
machine will drop. Unfortunately, a Linux&minus;style limit
of one packet per second makes a 65,536&minus;port scan take
more than 18 hours. Ideas for speeding your UDP scans up
include scanning more hosts in parallel, doing a quick scan
of just the popular ports first, scanning from behind the
firewall, and using <b>&minus;&minus;host&minus;timeout</b>
to skip slow hosts.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sY</b>

TCP and UDP protocols, combining most characteristics of TCP
and UDP, and also adding new features like
multi&minus;homing and multi&minus;streaming. It is mostly
being used for SS7/SIGTRAN related services but has the
potential to be used for other applications as well. SCTP
INIT scan is the SCTP equivalent of a TCP SYN scan. It can
be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second
on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls.
Like SYN scan, INIT scan is relatively unobtrusive and
stealthy, since it never completes SCTP associations. It
also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the
open, closed, and filtered states.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
technique is often referred to as half&minus;open scanning,
because you don't open a full SCTP association. You send an

and then wait for a response. An INIT&minus;ACK chunk
indicates the port is listening (open), while an ABORT chunk

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sN</b>;
<b>&minus;sF</b>; <b>&minus;sX</b> (TCP NULL, FIN, and Xmas

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">These
three scan types (even more are possible with the
<b>&minus;&minus;scanflags</b> option described in the next
section) exploit a subtle loophole in the</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">TCP RFC</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[8]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">to differentiate between open and
closed ports. Page 65 of RFC 793 says that &ldquo;if the
[destination] port state is CLOSED .... an incoming segment
not containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in
response.&rdquo; Then the next page discusses packets sent
to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating
that: &ldquo;you are unlikely to get here, but if you do,
drop the segment, and return.&rdquo;</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet
not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a
returned RST if the port is closed and no response at all if
the port is open. As long as none of those three bits are
included, any combination of the other three (FIN, PSH, and
URG) are OK. Nmap exploits this with three scan
types:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Null
scan (<b>&minus;sN</b>)</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">Does not
set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">FIN
scan (<b>&minus;sF</b>)</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">Sets just
the TCP FIN bit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Xmas
scan (<b>&minus;sX</b>)</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">Sets the
FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a
Christmas tree.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for
the TCP flags set in probe packets. If a RST packet is
received, the port is considered closed, while no response
means it is open|filtered. The port is marked filtered if an
ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13)
is received.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
key advantage to these scan types is that they can sneak
through certain non&minus;stateful firewalls and packet
filtering routers. Another advantage is that these scan
types are a little more stealthy than even a SYN scan. Don't
count on this though&mdash;most modern IDS products can be
configured to detect them. The big downside is that not all
systems follow RFC 793 to the letter. A number of systems
send RST responses to the probes regardless of whether the
port is open or not. This causes all of the ports to be
labeled closed. Major operating systems that do this are
Microsoft Windows, many Cisco devices, BSDI, and IBM OS/400.
This scan does work against most Unix&minus;based systems
though. Another downside of these scans is that they can't
distinguish open ports from certain filtered ones, leaving
you with the response open|filtered.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sA</b>
(TCP ACK scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This scan
is different than the others discussed so far in that it
never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is
used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they
are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
ACK scan probe packet has only the ACK flag set (unless you
use <b>&minus;&minus;scanflags</b>). When scanning
unfiltered systems, open and closed ports will both return a
RST packet. Nmap then labels them as unfiltered, meaning
that they are reachable by the ACK packet, but whether they
are open or closed is undetermined. Ports that don't
respond, or send certain ICMP error messages back (type 3,
code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13), are labeled
filtered.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sW</b>
(TCP Window scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Window
scan is exactly the same as ACK scan except that it exploits
an implementation detail of certain systems to differentiate
open ports from closed ones, rather than always printing
unfiltered when a RST is returned. It does this by examining
the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On some
systems, open ports use a positive window size (even for RST
packets) while closed ones have a zero window. So instead of
always listing a port as unfiltered when it receives a RST
back, Window scan lists the port as open or closed if the
TCP Window value in that reset is positive or zero,
respectively.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
scan relies on an implementation detail of a minority of
systems out on the Internet, so you can't always trust it.
Systems that don't support it will usually return all ports
closed. Of course, it is possible that the machine really
has no open ports. If most scanned ports are closed but a
few common port numbers (such as 22, 25, 53) are filtered,
the system is most likely susceptible. Occasionally, systems
will even show the exact opposite behavior. If your scan
shows 1,000 open ports and three closed or filtered ports,
then those three may very well be the truly open
ones.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;sM</b>
(TCP Maimon scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
Maimon scan is named after its discoverer, Uriel Maimon.. He
described the technique in Phrack Magazine issue #49
(November 1996).. Nmap, which included this technique, was
released two issues later. This technique is exactly the
same as NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans, except that the probe is
FIN/ACK. According to</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">RFC

<small><font color="#000000">[8]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">(TCP), a RST packet should be
generated in response to such a probe whether the port is
open or closed. However, Uriel noticed that many
BSD&minus;derived systems simply drop the packet if the port
is open.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;scanflags</b>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Truly
advanced Nmap users need not limit themselves to the canned
scan types offered. The <b>&minus;&minus;scanflags</b>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>&minus;&minus;scanflags</b> argument can be a numerical
flag value such as 9 (PSH and FIN), but using symbolic names
is easier. Just mash together any combination of URG, ACK,
PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN. For example,
<b>&minus;&minus;scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN</b> sets
everything, though it's not very useful for scanning. The
order these are specified in is irrelevant.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to specifying the desired flags, you can specify a
TCP scan type (such as <b>&minus;sA</b> or
<b>&minus;sF</b>). That base type tells Nmap how to
interpret responses. For example, a SYN scan considers
no&minus;response to indicate a filtered port, while a FIN
scan treats the same as open|filtered. Nmap will behave the
same way it does for the base scan type, except that it will
use the TCP flags you specify instead. If you don't specify
a base type, SYN scan is used.</font></p>

COOKIE ECHO scan is a more advanced SCTP scan. It takes
advantage of the fact that SCTP implementations should
silently drop packets containing COOKIE ECHO chunks on open
ports, but send an ABORT if the port is closed. The
advantage of this scan type is that it is not as obvious a
port scan than an INIT scan. Also, there may be
non&minus;stateful firewall rulesets blocking INIT chunks,
but not COOKIE ECHO chunks. Don't be fooled into thinking
that this will make a port scan invisible; a good IDS will
be able to detect SCTP COOKIE ECHO scans too. The downside
is that SCTP COOKIE ECHO scans cannot differentiate between
open and filtered ports, leaving you with the state
open|filtered in both cases.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">IP
protocol scan allows you to determine which IP protocols
(TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines.
This isn't technically a port scan, since it cycles through
IP protocol numbers rather than TCP or UDP port numbers. Yet
it still uses the <b>&minus;p</b> option to select scanned
protocol numbers, reports its results within the normal port
table format, and even uses the same underlying scan engine
as the true port scanning methods. So it is close enough to
a port scan that it belongs here.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Besides
being useful in its own right, protocol scan demonstrates
the power of open&minus;source software. While the
fundamental idea is pretty simple, I had not thought to add
it nor received any requests for such functionality. Then in
the summer of 2000, Gerhard Rieger. conceived the idea,
wrote an excellent patch implementing it, and sent it to the
announce mailing list. (then called nmap&minus;hackers).. I
incorporated that patch into the Nmap tree and released a
new version the next day. Few pieces of commercial software
have users enthusiastic enough to design and contribute
their own improvements!</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Protocol
scan works in a similar fashion to UDP scan. Instead of
iterating through the port number field of a UDP packet, it
sends IP packet headers and iterates through the
eight&minus;bit IP protocol field. The headers are usually
empty, containing no data and not even the proper header for
the claimed protocol. The exceptions are TCP, UDP, ICMP,
SCTP, and IGMP. A proper protocol header for those is
included since some systems won't send them otherwise and
because Nmap already has functions to create them. Instead
of watching for ICMP port unreachable messages, protocol
scan is on the lookout for ICMP <i>protocol</i> unreachable
messages. If Nmap receives any response in any protocol from
the target host, Nmap marks that protocol as open. An ICMP
protocol unreachable error (type 3, code 2) causes the
protocol to be marked as closed Other ICMP unreachable
errors (type 3, code 1, 3, 9, 10, or 13) cause the protocol
to be marked filtered (though they prove that ICMP is open
at the same time). If no response is received after
retransmissions, the protocol is marked
open|filtered</font></p>

<i>FTP relay host</i> (FTP bounce scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">An
interesting feature of the FTP protocol
(</font><b><font color="#0000FF">RFC 959</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[9]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) is support for so&minus;called proxy
FTP connections. This allows a user to connect to one FTP
server, then ask that files be sent to a third&minus;party
server. Such a feature is ripe for abuse on many levels, so
most servers have ceased supporting it. One of the abuses
this feature allows is causing the FTP server to port scan
other hosts. Simply ask the FTP server to send a file to
each interesting port of a target host in turn. The error
message will describe whether the port is open or not. This
is a good way to bypass firewalls because organizational FTP
servers are often placed where they have more access to
other internal hosts than any old Internet host would. Nmap
supports FTP bounce scan with the <b>&minus;b</b> option. It
takes an argument of the form
<i>username</i>:<i>password</i>@<i>server</i>:<i>port</i>.
<i>Server</i> is the name or IP address of a vulnerable FTP
server. As with a normal URL, you may omit
<i>username</i>:<i>password</i>, in which case anonymous
login credentials (user: anonymous password:&minus;wwwuser@)
are used. The port number (and preceding colon) may be
omitted as well, in which case the default FTP port (21) on
<i>server</i> is used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
vulnerability was widespread in 1997 when Nmap was released,
but has largely been fixed. Vulnerable servers are still
around, so it is worth trying when all else fails. If
bypassing a firewall is your goal, scan the target network
for port 21 (or even for any FTP services if you scan all
ports with version detection) and use the ftp&minus;bounce.
NSE script. Nmap will tell you whether the host is
vulnerable or not. If you are just trying to cover your
tracks, you don't need to (and, in fact, shouldn't) limit
yourself to hosts on the target network. Before you go
scanning random Internet addresses for vulnerable FTP
servers, consider that sysadmins may not appreciate you
abusing their servers in this way.</font></p>

<h2>PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER
<a name="PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to all of the scan methods discussed previously,
Nmap offers options for specifying which ports are scanned
and whether the scan order is randomized or sequential. By
default, Nmap scans the most common 1,000 ports for each
protocol.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;p</b>
<i>port ranges</i> (Only scan specified ports) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option specifies which ports you want to scan and overrides
the default. Individual port numbers are OK, as are ranges
separated by a hyphen (e.g. 1&minus;1023). The beginning
and/or end values of a range may be omitted, causing Nmap to
use 1 and 65535, respectively. So you can specify
<b>&minus;p&minus;</b> to scan ports from 1 through 65535.
Scanning port zero. is allowed if you specify it explicitly.
For IP protocol scanning (<b>&minus;sO</b>), this option
specifies the protocol numbers you wish to scan for
(0&ndash;255).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
scanning a combination of protocols (e.g. TCP and UDP), you
can specify a particular protocol by preceding the port
numbers by T: for TCP, U: for UDP, S: for SCTP, or P: for IP
Protocol. The qualifier lasts until you specify another
qualifier. For example, the argument <b>&minus;p
U:53,111,137,T:21&minus;25,80,139,8080</b> would scan UDP
ports 53, 111,and 137, as well as the listed TCP ports. Note
that to scan both UDP and TCP, you have to specify
<b>&minus;sU</b> and at least one TCP scan type (such as
<b>&minus;sS</b>, <b>&minus;sF</b>, or <b>&minus;sT</b>). If
no protocol qualifier is given, the port numbers are added
to all protocol lists. Ports can also be specified by name
according to what the port is referred to in the
nmap&minus;services. You can even use the wildcards * and ?
with the names. For example, to scan FTP and all ports whose
names begin with &ldquo;http&rdquo;, use <b>&minus;p
ftp,http*</b>. Be careful about shell expansions and quote
the argument to <b>&minus;p</b> if unsure.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Ranges
of ports can be surrounded by square brackets to indicate
ports inside that range that appear in nmap&minus;services.
For example, the following will scan all ports in
nmap&minus;services equal to or below 1024: <b>&minus;p
[&minus;1024]</b>. Be careful with shell expansions and
quote the argument to <b>&minus;p</b> if unsure.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;F</b>
(Fast (limited port) scan) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specifies
that you wish to scan fewer ports than the default. Normally
Nmap scans the most common 1,000 ports for each scanned
protocol. With <b>&minus;F</b>, this is reduced to
100.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
needs an nmap&minus;services file with frequency information
in order to know which ports are the most common. If port
frequency information isn't available, perhaps because of
the use of a custom nmap&minus;services file, Nmap scans all
named ports plus ports 1&minus;1024. In that case,
<b>&minus;F</b> means to scan only ports that are named in
the services file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;r</b>
(Don't randomize ports) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">By
default, Nmap randomizes the scanned port order (except that
certain commonly accessible ports are moved near the
beginning for efficiency reasons). This randomization is
normally desirable, but you can specify <b>&minus;r</b> for
sequential (sorted from lowest to highest) port scanning
instead.</font></p>

<h2>SERVICE AND VERSION DETECTION
<a name="SERVICE AND VERSION DETECTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Point
Nmap at a remote machine and it might tell you that ports
25/tcp, 80/tcp, and 53/udp are open. Using its
nmap&minus;services. database of about 2,200
well&minus;known services,. Nmap would report that those
ports probably correspond to a mail server (SMTP), web
server (HTTP), and name server (DNS) respectively. This
lookup is usually accurate&mdash;the vast majority of
daemons listening on TCP port 25 are, in fact, mail servers.
However, you should not bet your security on this! People
can and do run services on strange ports..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Even
if Nmap is right, and the hypothetical server above is
running SMTP, HTTP, and DNS servers, that is not a lot of
information. When doing vulnerability assessments (or even
simple network inventories) of your companies or clients,
you really want to know which mail and DNS servers and
versions are running. Having an accurate version number
helps dramatically in determining which exploits a server is
vulnerable to. Version detection helps you obtain this
information.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">After
TCP and/or UDP ports are discovered using one of the other
scan methods, version detection interrogates those ports to
determine more about what is actually running. The
nmap&minus;service&minus;probes. database contains probes
for querying various services and match expressions to
recognize and parse responses. Nmap tries to determine the
service protocol (e.g. FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP), the
application name (e.g. ISC BIND, Apache httpd, Solaris
telnetd), the version number, hostname, device type (e.g.
printer, router), the OS family (e.g. Windows, Linux). When
possible, Nmap also gets the Common Platform Enumeration
(CPE). representation of this information. Sometimes
miscellaneous details like whether an X server is open to
connections, the SSH protocol version, or the KaZaA user
name, are available. Of course, most services don't provide
all of this information. If Nmap was compiled with OpenSSL
support, it will connect to SSL servers to deduce the
service listening behind that encryption layer.. Some UDP
ports are left in the open|filtered state after a UDP port
scan is unable to determine whether the port is open or
filtered. Version detection will try to elicit a response
from these ports (just as it does with open ports), and
change the state to open if it succeeds. open|filtered TCP
ports are treated the same way. Note that the Nmap
<b>&minus;A</b> option enables version detection among other
things. A paper documenting the workings, usage, and
customization of version detection is available at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/book/vscan.html</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
RPC services are discovered, the Nmap RPC grinder. is
automatically used to determine the RPC program and version
numbers. It takes all the TCP/UDP ports detected as RPC and
floods them with SunRPC program NULL commands in an attempt
to determine whether they are RPC ports, and if so, what
program and version number they serve up. Thus you can
effectively obtain the same info as <b>rpcinfo &minus;p</b>
even if the target's portmapper is behind a firewall (or
protected by TCP wrappers). Decoys do not currently work
with RPC scan..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
Nmap receives responses from a service but cannot match them
to its database, it prints out a special fingerprint and a
URL for you to submit if to if you know for sure what is
running on the port. Please take a couple minutes to make
the submission so that your find can benefit everyone.
Thanks to these submissions, Nmap has about 6,500 pattern
matches for more than 650 protocols such as SMTP, FTP, HTTP,
etc..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Version

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Enables

combined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;allports</b>
(Don't exclude any ports from version detection)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">By
default, Nmap version detection skips TCP port 9100 because
some printers simply print anything sent to that port,
leading to dozens of pages of HTTP GET requests, binary SSL
session requests, etc. This behavior can be changed by
modifying or removing the Exclude directive in
nmap&minus;service&minus;probes, or you can specify
<b>&minus;&minus;allports</b> to scan all ports regardless
of any Exclude directive.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;version&minus;intensity</b>
<i>intensity</i> (Set version scan intensity) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When
performing a version scan (<b>&minus;sV</b>), Nmap sends a
series of probes, each of which is assigned a rarity value
between one and nine. The lower&minus;numbered probes are
effective against a wide variety of common services, while
the higher&minus;numbered ones are rarely useful. The
intensity level specifies which probes should be applied.
The higher the number, the more likely it is the service
will be correctly identified. However, high intensity scans
take longer. The intensity must be between 0 and 9.. The
default is 7.. When a probe is registered to the target port
via the nmap&minus;service&minus;probesports directive, that
probe is tried regardless of intensity level. This ensures
that the DNS probes will always be attempted against any
open port 53, the SSL probe will be done against 443,
etc.</font></p>

<h2>OS DETECTION
<a name="OS DETECTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">One
of Nmap's best&minus;known features is remote OS detection
using TCP/IP stack fingerprinting. Nmap sends a series of
TCP and UDP packets to the remote host and examines
practically every bit in the responses. After performing
dozens of tests such as TCP ISN sampling, TCP options
support and ordering, IP ID sampling, and the initial window
size check, Nmap compares the results to its
nmap&minus;os&minus;db. database of more than 2,600 known OS
fingerprints and prints out the OS details if there is a
match. Each fingerprint includes a freeform textual
description of the OS, and a classification which provides
the vendor name (e.g. Sun), underlying OS (e.g. Solaris), OS
generation (e.g. 10), and device type (general purpose,
router, switch, game console, etc). Most fingerprints also
have a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE). representation,
like cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
Nmap is unable to guess the OS of a machine, and conditions
are good (e.g. at least one open port and one closed port
were found), Nmap will provide a URL you can use to submit
the fingerprint if you know (for sure) the OS running on the
machine. By doing this you contribute to the pool of
operating systems known to Nmap and thus it will be more
accurate for everyone.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">OS
detection enables some other tests which make use of
information that is gathered during the process anyway. One
of these is TCP Sequence Predictability Classification. This
measures approximately how hard it is to establish a forged
TCP connection against the remote host. It is useful for
exploiting source&minus;IP based trust relationships
(rlogin, firewall filters, etc) or for hiding the source of
an attack. This sort of spoofing is rarely performed any
more, but many machines are still vulnerable to it. The
actual difficulty number is based on statistical sampling
and may fluctuate. It is generally better to use the English
classification such as &ldquo;worthy challenge&rdquo; or
&ldquo;trivial joke&rdquo;. This is only reported in normal
output in verbose (<b>&minus;v</b>) mode. When verbose mode
is enabled along with <b>&minus;O</b>, IP ID sequence
generation is also reported. Most machines are in the
&ldquo;incremental&rdquo; class, which means that they
increment the ID field in the IP header for each packet they
send. This makes them vulnerable to several advanced
information gathering and spoofing attacks.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Another
bit of extra information enabled by OS detection is a guess
at a target's uptime. This uses the TCP timestamp option
(</font><b><font color="#0000FF">RFC 1323</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[10]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) to guess when a machine was last
rebooted. The guess can be inaccurate due to the timestamp
counter not being initialized to zero or the counter
overflowing and wrapping around, so it is printed only in
verbose mode.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A

OS detection is available at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">OS
detection is enabled and controlled with the following
options:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;O</b>
(Enable OS detection) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Enables
OS detection, as discussed above. Alternatively, you can use
<b>&minus;A</b> to enable OS detection along with other
things.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;osscan&minus;limit</b>
(Limit OS detection to promising targets) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">OS
detection is far more effective if at least one open and one
closed TCP port are found. Set this option and Nmap will not
even try OS detection against hosts that do not meet this
criteria. This can save substantial time, particularly on
<b>&minus;Pn</b> scans against many hosts. It only matters
when OS detection is requested with <b>&minus;O</b> or
<b>&minus;A</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;osscan&minus;guess</b>;
<b>&minus;&minus;fuzzy</b> (Guess OS detection results)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When Nmap
is unable to detect a perfect OS match, it sometimes offers
up near&minus;matches as possibilities. The match has to be
very close for Nmap to do this by default. Either of these
(equivalent) options make Nmap guess more aggressively. Nmap
will still tell you when an imperfect match is printed and
display its confidence level (percentage) for each
guess.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;os&minus;tries</b>
(Set the maximum number of OS detection tries against a
target) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When Nmap
performs OS detection against a target and fails to find a
perfect match, it usually repeats the attempt. By default,
Nmap tries five times if conditions are favorable for OS
fingerprint submission, and twice when conditions aren't so
good. Specifying a lower
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;os&minus;tries</b> value (such as
1) speeds Nmap up, though you miss out on retries which
could potentially identify the OS. Alternatively, a high
value may be set to allow even more retries when conditions
are favorable. This is rarely done, except to generate
better fingerprints for submission and integration into the
Nmap OS database.</font></p>

<h2>NMAP SCRIPTING ENGINE (NSE)

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The

vulnerability exploitation.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
reflect those different uses and to simplify the choice of
which scripts to run, each script contains a field
associating it with one or more categories. Currently
defined categories are auth, broadcast, default. discovery,
dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe,
version, and vuln. These are all described at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-categories</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>

<h2>TIMING AND PERFORMANCE
<a name="TIMING AND PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">One
of my highest Nmap development priorities has always been
performance. A default scan (<b>nmap</b> <i>hostname</i>) of
a host on my local network takes a fifth of a second. That
is barely enough time to blink, but adds up when you are
scanning hundreds or thousands of hosts. Moreover, certain
scan options such as UDP scanning and version detection can
increase scan times substantially. So can certain firewall
configurations, particularly response rate limiting. While
Nmap utilizes parallelism and many advanced algorithms to
accelerate these scans, the user has ultimate control over
how Nmap runs. Expert users carefully craft Nmap commands to
obtain only the information they care about while meeting
their time constraints.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Techniques
for improving scan times include omitting non&minus;critical
tests, and upgrading to the latest version of Nmap
(performance enhancements are made frequently). Optimizing
timing parameters can also make a substantial difference.
Those options are listed below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Some
options accept a time parameter. This is specified in
seconds by default, though you can append &lsquo;ms&rsquo;,
&lsquo;s&rsquo;, &lsquo;m&rsquo;, or &lsquo;h&rsquo; to the
value to specify milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours.
So the <b>&minus;&minus;host&minus;timeout</b> arguments
900000ms, 900, 900s, and 15m all do the same
thing.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;hostgroup</b>
<i>numhosts</i>; <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;hostgroup</b>
<i>numhosts</i> (Adjust parallel scan group sizes)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap has
the ability to port scan or version scan multiple hosts in
parallel. Nmap does this by dividing the target IP space
into groups and then scanning one group at a time. In
general, larger groups are more efficient. The downside is
that host results can't be provided until the whole group is
finished. So if Nmap started out with a group size of 50,
the user would not receive any reports (except for the
updates offered in verbose mode) until the first 50 hosts
are completed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">By
default, Nmap takes a compromise approach to this conflict.
It starts out with a group size as low as five so the first
results come quickly and then increases the groupsize to as
high as 1024. The exact default numbers depend on the
options given. For efficiency reasons, Nmap uses larger
group sizes for UDP or few&minus;port TCP scans.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
a maximum group size is specified with
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;hostgroup</b>, Nmap will never
exceed that size. Specify a minimum size with
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;hostgroup</b> and Nmap will try
to keep group sizes above that level. Nmap may have to use
smaller groups than you specify if there are not enough
target hosts left on a given interface to fulfill the
specified minimum. Both may be set to keep the group size
within a specific range, though this is rarely
desired.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
options do not have an effect during the host discovery
phase of a scan. This includes plain ping scans
(<b>&minus;sn</b>). Host discovery always works in large
groups of hosts to improve speed and accuracy.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
primary use of these options is to specify a large minimum
group size so that the full scan runs more quickly. A common
choice is 256 to scan a network in Class C sized chunks. For
a scan with many ports, exceeding that number is unlikely to
help much. For scans of just a few port numbers, host group
sizes of 2048 or more may be helpful.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parallelism</b>
<i>numprobes</i>; <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parallelism</b>
<i>numprobes</i> (Adjust probe parallelization) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">These
options control the total number of probes that may be
outstanding for a host group. They are used for port
scanning and host discovery. By default, Nmap calculates an
ever&minus;changing ideal parallelism based on network
performance. If packets are being dropped, Nmap slows down
and allows fewer outstanding probes. The ideal probe number
slowly rises as the network proves itself worthy. These
options place minimum or maximum bounds on that variable. By
default, the ideal parallelism can drop to one if the
network proves unreliable and rise to several hundred in
perfect conditions.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
most common usage is to set
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parallelism</b> to a number
higher than one to speed up scans of poorly performing hosts
or networks. This is a risky option to play with, as setting
it too high may affect accuracy. Setting this also reduces
Nmap's ability to control parallelism dynamically based on
network conditions. A value of 10 might be reasonable,
though I only adjust this value as a last resort.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parallelism</b> option is
sometimes set to one to prevent Nmap from sending more than
one probe at a time to hosts. The
<b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;delay</b> option, discussed
later, is another way to do this.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b>
<i>time</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b>
<i>time</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;initial&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b>
<i>time</i> (Adjust probe timeouts) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap
maintains a running timeout value for determining how long
it will wait for a probe response before giving up or
retransmitting the probe. This is calculated based on the
response times of previous probes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the network latency shows itself to be significant and
variable, this timeout can grow to several seconds. It also
starts at a conservative (high) level and may stay that way
for a while when Nmap scans unresponsive hosts.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Specifying
a lower <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;initial&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b> than
the defaults can cut scan times significantly. This is
particularly true for pingless (<b>&minus;Pn</b>) scans, and
those against heavily filtered networks. Don't get too
aggressive though. The scan can end up taking longer if you
specify such a low value that many probes are timing out and
retransmitting while the response is in transit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
all the hosts are on a local network, 100 milliseconds
(<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rtt&minus;timeout 100ms</b>) is
a reasonable aggressive value. If routing is involved, ping
a host on the network first with the ICMP ping utility, or
with a custom packet crafter such as Nping. that is more
likely to get through a firewall. Look at the maximum round
trip time out of ten packets or so. You might want to double
that for the
<b>&minus;&minus;initial&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b> and
triple or quadruple it for the
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b>. I
generally do not set the maximum RTT below 100&nbsp;ms, no
matter what the ping times are. Nor do I exceed
1000&nbsp;ms.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rtt&minus;timeout</b>
is a rarely used option that could be useful when a network
is so unreliable that even Nmap's default is too aggressive.
Since Nmap only reduces the timeout down to the minimum when
the network seems to be reliable, this need is unusual and
should be reported as a bug to the nmap&minus;dev mailing
list..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;retries</b>
<i>numtries</i> (Specify the maximum number of port scan
probe retransmissions) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When Nmap
receives no response to a port scan probe, it could mean the
port is filtered. Or maybe the probe or response was simply
lost on the network. It is also possible that the target
host has rate limiting enabled that temporarily blocked the
response. So Nmap tries again by retransmitting the initial
probe. If Nmap detects poor network reliability, it may try
many more times before giving up on a port. While this
benefits accuracy, it also lengthen scan times. When
performance is critical, scans may be sped up by limiting
the number of retransmissions allowed. You can even specify
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;retries 0</b> to prevent any
retransmissions, though that is only recommended for
situations such as informal surveys where occasional missed
ports and hosts are acceptable.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
default (with no <b>&minus;T</b> template) is to allow ten
retransmissions. If a network seems reliable and the target
hosts aren't rate limiting, Nmap usually only does one
retransmission. So most target scans aren't even affected by
dropping <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;retries</b> to a low
value such as three. Such values can substantially speed
scans of slow (rate limited) hosts. You usually lose some
information when Nmap gives up on ports early, though that
may be preferable to letting the
<b>&minus;&minus;host&minus;timeout</b> expire and losing
all information about the target.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;host&minus;timeout</b>
<i>time</i> (Give up on slow target hosts) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Some
hosts simply take a <i>long</i> time to scan. This may be
due to poorly performing or unreliable networking hardware
or software, packet rate limiting, or a restrictive
firewall. The slowest few percent of the scanned hosts can
eat up a majority of the scan time. Sometimes it is best to
cut your losses and skip those hosts initially. Specify
<b>&minus;&minus;host&minus;timeout</b> with the maximum
amount of time you are willing to wait. For example, specify
30m to ensure that Nmap doesn't waste more than half an hour
on a single host. Note that Nmap may be scanning other hosts
at the same time during that half an hour, so it isn't a
complete loss. A host that times out is skipped. No port
table, OS detection, or version detection results are
printed for that host.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;delay</b>
<i>time</i>; <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;scan&minus;delay</b>
<i>time</i> (Adjust delay between probes) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option causes Nmap to wait at least the given amount of time
between each probe it sends to a given host. This is
particularly useful in the case of rate limiting.. Solaris
machines (among many others) will usually respond to UDP
scan probe packets with only one ICMP message per second.
Any more than that sent by Nmap will be wasteful. A
<b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;delay</b> of 1s will keep Nmap
at that slow rate. Nmap tries to detect rate limiting and
adjust the scan delay accordingly, but it doesn't hurt to
specify it explicitly if you already know what rate works
best.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
Nmap adjusts the scan delay upward to cope with rate
limiting, the scan slows down dramatically. The
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;scan&minus;delay</b> option
specifies the largest delay that Nmap will allow. A low
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;scan&minus;delay</b> can speed up
Nmap, but it is risky. Setting this value too low can lead
to wasteful packet retransmissions and possible missed ports
when the target implements strict rate limiting.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Another
use of <b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;delay</b> is to evade
threshold based intrusion detection and prevention systems
(IDS/IPS)..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rate</b>
<i>number</i>; <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate</b>
<i>number</i> (Directly control the scanning rate)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap's
dynamic timing does a good job of finding an appropriate
speed at which to scan. Sometimes, however, you may happen
to know an appropriate scanning rate for a network, or you
may have to guarantee that a scan will be finished by a
certain time. Or perhaps you must keep Nmap from scanning
too quickly. The <b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rate</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate</b> options are designed for
these situations.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
the <b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rate</b> option is given Nmap
will do its best to send packets as fast as or faster than
the given rate. The argument is a positive real number
representing a packet rate in packets per second. For
example, specifying <b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rate 300</b>
means that Nmap will try to keep the sending rate at or
above 300 packets per second. Specifying a minimum rate does
not keep Nmap from going faster if conditions
warrant.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Likewise,
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate</b> limits a scan's sending
rate to a given maximum. Use <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate
100</b>, for example, to limit sending to 100 packets per
second on a fast network. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate 0.1</b> for a slow scan of
one packet every ten seconds. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;rate</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rate</b> together to keep the
rate inside a certain range.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
two options are global, affecting an entire scan, not
individual hosts. They only affect port scans and host
discovery scans. Other features like OS detection implement
their own timing.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">There
are two conditions when the actual scanning rate may fall
below the requested minimum. The first is if the minimum is
faster than the fastest rate at which Nmap can send, which
is dependent on hardware. In this case Nmap will simply send
packets as fast as possible, but be aware that such high
rates are likely to cause a loss of accuracy. The second
case is when Nmap has nothing to send, for example at the
end of a scan when the last probes have been sent and Nmap
is waiting for them to time out or be responded to. It's
normal to see the scanning rate drop at the end of a scan or
in between hostgroups. The sending rate may temporarily
exceed the maximum to make up for unpredictable delays, but
on average the rate will stay at or below the
maximum.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Specifying
a minimum rate should be done with care. Scanning faster
than a network can support may lead to a loss of accuracy.
In some cases, using a faster rate can make a scan take
<i>longer</i> than it would with a slower rate. This is
because Nmap's adaptive retransmission algorithms will
detect the network congestion caused by an excessive
scanning rate and increase the number of retransmissions in
order to improve accuracy. So even though packets are sent
at a higher rate, more packets are sent overall. Cap the
number of retransmissions with the
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;retries</b> option if you need to
set an upper limit on total scan time.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;defeat&minus;rst&minus;ratelimit</b>
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Many
hosts have long used rate limiting. to reduce the number of
ICMP error messages (such as port&minus;unreachable errors)
they send. Some systems now apply similar rate limits to the
RST (reset) packets they generate. This can slow Nmap down
dramatically as it adjusts its timing to reflect those rate
limits. You can tell Nmap to ignore those rate limits (for
port scans such as SYN scan which <i>don't</i> treat
non&minus;responsive ports as open) by specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;defeat&minus;rst&minus;ratelimit</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Using
this option can reduce accuracy, as some ports will appear
non&minus;responsive because Nmap didn't wait long enough
for a rate&minus;limited RST response. With a SYN scan, the
non&minus;response results in the port being labeled
filtered rather than the closed state we see when RST
packets are received. This option is useful when you only
care about open ports, and distinguishing between closed and
filtered ports isn't worth the extra time.</font></p>

<b>polite&nbsp;</b>(<b>2</b>),
<b>normal&nbsp;</b>(<b>3</b>),
<b>aggressive&nbsp;</b>(<b>4</b>), and
<b>insane&nbsp;</b>(<b>5</b>). The first two are for IDS
evasion. Polite mode slows down the scan to use less
bandwidth and target machine resources. Normal mode is the
default and so <b>&minus;T3</b> does nothing. Aggressive
mode speeds scans up by making the assumption that you are
on a reasonably fast and reliable network. Finally insane
mode. assumes that you are on an extraordinarily fast
network or are willing to sacrifice some accuracy for
speed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
templates allow the user to specify how aggressive they wish
to be, while leaving Nmap to pick the exact timing values.
The templates also make some minor speed adjustments for
which fine&minus;grained control options do not currently
exist. For example, <b>&minus;T4</b>. prohibits the dynamic
scan delay from exceeding 10&nbsp;ms for TCP ports and
<b>&minus;T5</b> caps that value at 5&nbsp;ms. Templates can
be used in combination with fine&minus;grained controls, and
the fine&minus;grained controls will you specify will take
precedence over the timing template default for that
parameter. I recommend using <b>&minus;T4</b> when scanning
reasonably modern and reliable networks. Keep that option
even when you add fine&minus;grained controls so that you
benefit from those extra minor optimizations that it
enables.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
you are on a decent broadband or ethernet connection, I
would recommend always using <b>&minus;T4</b>. Some people
love <b>&minus;T5</b> though it is too aggressive for my
taste. People sometimes specify <b>&minus;T2</b> because
they think it is less likely to crash hosts or because they
consider themselves to be polite in general. They often
don't realize just how slow <b>&minus;T polite</b>. really
is. Their scan may take ten times longer than a default
scan. Machine crashes and bandwidth problems are rare with
the default timing options (<b>&minus;T3</b>) and so I
normally recommend that for cautious scanners. Omitting
version detection is far more effective than playing with
timing values at reducing these problems.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
<b>&minus;T0</b>. and <b>&minus;T1</b>. may be useful for
avoiding IDS alerts, they will take an extraordinarily long
time to scan thousands of machines or ports. For such a long
scan, you may prefer to set the exact timing values you need
rather than rely on the canned <b>&minus;T0</b> and
<b>&minus;T1</b> values.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
main effects of <b>T0</b> are serializing the scan so only
one port is scanned at a time, and waiting five minutes
between sending each probe. <b>T1</b> and <b>T2</b> are
similar but they only wait 15 seconds and 0.4 seconds,
respectively, between probes. <b>T3</b> is Nmap's default
behavior, which includes parallelization.. does the
equivalent of <b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;rtt&minus;timeout

<h2>FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING
<a name="FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Many
Internet pioneers envisioned a global open network with a
universal IP address space allowing virtual connections
between any two nodes. This allows hosts to act as true
peers, serving and retrieving information from each other.
People could access all of their home systems from work,
changing the climate control settings or unlocking the doors
for early guests. This vision of universal connectivity has
been stifled by address space shortages and security
concerns. In the early 1990s, organizations began deploying
firewalls for the express purpose of reducing connectivity.
Huge networks were cordoned off from the unfiltered Internet
by application proxies, network address translation, and
packet filters. The unrestricted flow of information gave
way to tight regulation of approved communication channels
and the content that passes over them.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Network
obstructions such as firewalls can make mapping a network
exceedingly difficult. It will not get any easier, as
stifling casual reconnaissance is often a key goal of
implementing the devices. Nevertheless, Nmap offers many
features to help understand these complex networks, and to
verify that filters are working as intended. It even
supports mechanisms for bypassing poorly implemented
defenses. One of the best methods of understanding your
network security posture is to try to defeat it. Place
yourself in the mind&minus;set of an attacker, and deploy
techniques from this section against your networks. Launch
an FTP bounce scan, idle scan, fragmentation attack, or try
to tunnel through one of your own proxies.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to restricting network activity, companies are
increasingly monitoring traffic with intrusion detection
systems (IDS). All of the major IDSs ship with rules
designed to detect Nmap scans because scans are sometimes a
precursor to attacks. Many of these products have recently
morphed into intrusion <i>prevention</i> systems (IPS). that
actively block traffic deemed malicious. Unfortunately for
network administrators and IDS vendors, reliably detecting
bad intentions by analyzing packet data is a tough problem.
Attackers with patience, skill, and the help of certain Nmap
options can usually pass by IDSs undetected. Meanwhile,
administrators must cope with large numbers of false
positive results where innocent activity is misdiagnosed and
alerted on or blocked.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Occasionally
people suggest that Nmap should not offer features for
evading firewall rules or sneaking past IDSs. They argue
that these features are just as likely to be misused by
attackers as used by administrators to enhance security. The
problem with this logic is that these methods would still be
used by attackers, who would just find other tools or patch
the functionality into Nmap. Meanwhile, administrators would
find it that much harder to do their jobs. Deploying only
modern, patched FTP servers is a far more powerful defense
than trying to prevent the distribution of tools
implementing the FTP bounce attack.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">There
is no magic bullet (or Nmap option) for detecting and
subverting firewalls and IDS systems. It takes skill and
experience. A tutorial is beyond the scope of this reference
guide, which only lists the relevant options and describes
what they do.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;f</b>
(fragment packets); <b>&minus;&minus;mtu</b> (using the
specified MTU) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
<b>&minus;f</b> option causes the requested scan (including
ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets. The idea is
to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it
harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and
other annoyances to detect what you are doing. Be careful
with this! Some programs have trouble handling these tiny
packets. The old&minus;school sniffer named Sniffit
segmentation faulted immediately upon receiving the first
fragment. Specify this option once, and Nmap splits the
packets into eight bytes or less after the IP header. So a
20&minus;byte TCP header would be split into three packets.
Two with eight bytes of the TCP header, and one with the
final four. Of course each fragment also has an IP header.
Specify <b>&minus;f</b> again to use 16 bytes per fragment
(reducing the number of fragments).. Or you can specify your
own offset size with the <b>&minus;&minus;mtu</b> option.
Don't also specify <b>&minus;f</b> if you use
<b>&minus;&minus;mtu</b>. The offset must be a multiple of
eight. While fragmented packets won't get by packet filters
and firewalls that queue all IP fragments, such as the
<i>CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG</i> option in the Linux kernel,
some networks can't afford the performance hit this causes
and thus leave it disabled. Others can't enable this because
fragments may take different routes into their networks.
Some source systems defragment outgoing packets in the
kernel. Linux with the iptables. connection tracking module
is one such example. Do a scan while a sniffer such as
Wireshark. is running to ensure that sent packets are
fragmented. If your host OS is causing problems, try the
<b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;eth</b>. option to bypass the IP
layer and send raw ethernet frames.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Fragmentation
is only supported for Nmap's raw packet features, which
includes TCP and UDP port scans (except connect scan and FTP
bounce scan) and OS detection. Features such as version
detection and the Nmap Scripting Engine generally don't
support fragmentation because they rely on your host's TCP
stack to communicate with target services.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;D</b>
<i>decoy1</i><b>[,</b><i>decoy2</i>]<b>[,ME][,...]</b>
(Cloak a scan with decoys) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Causes a
decoy scan to be performed, which makes it appear to the
remote host that the host(s) you specify as decoys are
scanning the target network too. Thus their IDS might report
5&ndash;10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but they
won't know which IP was scanning them and which were
innocent decoys. While this can be defeated through router
path tracing, response&minus;dropping, and other active
mechanisms, it is generally an effective technique for
hiding your IP address.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Separate
each decoy host with commas, and you can optionally use ME.
as one of the decoys to represent the position for your real
IP address. If you put ME in the sixth position or later,
some common port scan detectors (such as Solar Designer's.
excellent Scanlogd). are unlikely to show your IP address at
all. If you don't use ME, Nmap will put you in a random
position. You can also use RND. to generate a random,
non&minus;reserved IP address, or RND:<i>number</i> to
generate <i>number</i> addresses.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the hosts you use as decoys should be up or you might
accidentally SYN flood your targets. Also it will be pretty
easy to determine which host is scanning if only one is
actually up on the network. You might want to use IP
addresses instead of names (so the decoy networks don't see
you in their nameserver logs).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Decoys
are used both in the initial ping scan (using ICMP, SYN,
ACK, or whatever) and during the actual port scanning phase.
Decoys are also used during remote OS detection
(<b>&minus;O</b>). Decoys do not work with version detection
or TCP connect scan. When a scan delay is in effect, the
delay is enforced between each batch of spoofed probes, not
between each individual probe. Because decoys are sent as a
batch all at once, they may temporarily violate congestion
control limits.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is worth noting that using too many decoys may slow your
scan and potentially even make it less accurate. Also, some
ISPs will filter out your spoofed packets, but many do not
restrict spoofed IP packets at all.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;S</b>
<i>IP_Address</i> (Spoof source address) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">In some
circumstances, Nmap may not be able to determine your source
address (Nmap will tell you if this is the case). In this
situation, use <b>&minus;S</b> with the IP address of the
interface you wish to send packets through.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Another
possible use of this flag is to spoof the scan to make the
targets think that <i>someone else</i> is scanning them.
Imagine a company being repeatedly port scanned by a
competitor! The <b>&minus;e</b> option and <b>&minus;Pn</b>
are generally required for this sort of usage. Note that you
usually won't receive reply packets back (they will be
addressed to the IP you are spoofing), so Nmap won't produce
useful reports.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;e</b>
<i>interface</i> (Use specified interface) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Tells
Nmap what interface to send and receive packets on. Nmap
should be able to detect this automatically, but it will
tell you if it cannot.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;source&minus;port</b>
<i>portnumber</i><b>; &minus;g</b> <i>portnumber</i> (Spoof
source port number) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">One
surprisingly common misconfiguration is to trust traffic
based only on the source port number. It is easy to
understand how this comes about. An administrator will set
up a shiny new firewall, only to be flooded with complaints
from ungrateful users whose applications stopped working. In
particular, DNS may be broken because the UDP DNS replies
from external servers can no longer enter the network. FTP
is another common example. In active FTP transfers, the
remote server tries to establish a connection back to the
client to transfer the requested file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Secure
solutions to these problems exist, often in the form of
application&minus;level proxies or protocol&minus;parsing
firewall modules. Unfortunately there are also easier,
insecure solutions. Noting that DNS replies come from port
53 and active FTP from port 20, many administrators have
fallen into the trap of simply allowing incoming traffic
from those ports. They often assume that no attacker would
notice and exploit such firewall holes. In other cases,
administrators consider this a short&minus;term
stop&minus;gap measure until they can implement a more
secure solution. Then they forget the security
upgrade.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Overworked
network administrators are not the only ones to fall into
this trap. Numerous products have shipped with these
insecure rules. Even Microsoft has been guilty. The IPsec
filters that shipped with Windows 2000 and Windows XP
contain an implicit rule that allows all TCP or UDP traffic
from port 88 (Kerberos). In another well&minus;known case,
versions of the Zone Alarm personal firewall up to 2.1.25
allowed any incoming UDP packets with the source port 53
(DNS) or 67 (DHCP).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
offers the <b>&minus;g</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;source&minus;port</b> options (they are
equivalent) to exploit these weaknesses. Simply provide a
port number and Nmap will send packets from that port where
possible. Most scanning operations that use raw sockets,
including SYN and UDP scans, support the option completely.
The option notably doesn't have an effect for any operations
that use normal operating system sockets, including DNS
requests, TCP <b>connect</b> scan,. version detection, and
script scanning. Setting the source port also doesn't work
for OS detection, because Nmap must use different port
numbers for certain OS detection tests to work
properly.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;data&minus;length</b>
<i>number</i> (Append random data to sent packets)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Normally
Nmap sends minimalist packets containing only a header. So
its TCP packets are generally 40 bytes and ICMP echo
requests are just 28. Some UDP ports. and IP protocols. get
a custom payload by default. This option tells Nmap to
append the given number of random bytes to most of the
packets it sends, and not to use any protocol&minus;specific
payloads. (Use <b>&minus;&minus;data&minus;length 0</b> for
no random or protocol&minus;specific payloads.. OS detection
(<b>&minus;O</b>) packets are not affected. because accuracy
there requires probe consistency, but most pinging and
portscan packets support this. It slows things down a
little, but can make a scan slightly less
conspicuous.</font></p>

<small><font color="#000000">[13]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">offers several options which may be
placed in packet headers. Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options,
IP options are rarely seen due to practicality and security
concerns. In fact, many Internet routers block the most
dangerous options such as source routing. Yet options can
still be useful in some cases for determining and
manipulating the network route to target machines. For
example, you may be able to use the record route option to
determine a path to a target even when more traditional
traceroute&minus;style approaches fail. Or if your packets
are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able to
specify a different route with the strict or loose source
routing options.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply pass in
values as the argument to
<b>&minus;&minus;ip&minus;options</b>. Precede each hex
number with \x then the two digits. You may repeat certain
characters by following them with an asterisk and then the
number of times you wish them to repeat. For example,
\x01\x07\x04\x00*36\x01 is a hex string containing 36 NUL
bytes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying options.
Simply pass the letter R, T, or U to request
record&minus;route,. record&minus;timestamp,. or both
options together, respectively. Loose or strict source
routing. may be specified with an L or S followed by a space
and then a space&minus;separated list of IP

Nmap to shuffle each group of up to 16384 hosts before it
scans them. This can make the scans less obvious to various
network monitoring systems, especially when you combine it
with slow timing options. If you want to randomize over
larger group sizes, increase <i>PING_GROUP_SZ</i>. in
nmap.h. and recompile. An alternative solution is to
generate the target IP list with a list scan (<b>&minus;sL

to use the given MAC address for all of the raw ethernet
frames it sends. This option implies
<b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;eth</b>. to ensure that Nmap

can take several formats. If it is simply the number 0, Nmap
chooses a completely random MAC address for the session. If
the given string is an even number of hex digits (with the
pairs optionally separated by a colon), Nmap will use those
as the MAC. If fewer than 12 hex digits are provided, Nmap
fills in the remainder of the six bytes with random values.
If the argument isn't a zero or hex string, Nmap looks
through nmap&minus;mac&minus;prefixes to find a vendor name
containing the given string (it is case insensitive). If a
match is found, Nmap uses the vendor's OUI (three&minus;byte

<h2>OUTPUT
<a name="OUTPUT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Any
security tool is only as useful as the output it generates.
Complex tests and algorithms are of little value if they
aren't presented in an organized and comprehensible fashion.
Given the number of ways Nmap is used by people and other
software, no single format can please everyone. So Nmap
offers several formats, including the interactive mode for
humans to read directly and XML for easy parsing by
software.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to offering different output formats, Nmap provides
options for controlling the verbosity of output as well as
debugging messages. Output types may be sent to standard
output or to named files, which Nmap can append to or
clobber. Output files may also be used to resume aborted
scans.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
makes output available in five different formats. The
default is called interactive output,. and it is sent to
standard output (stdout).. There is also normal output,.
which is similar to interactive except that it displays less
runtime information and warnings since it is expected to be
analyzed after the scan completes rather than
interactively.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">XML
output. is one of the most important output types, as it can
be converted to HTML, easily parsed by programs such as Nmap
graphical user interfaces, or imported into
databases.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
two remaining output types are the simple grepable output.
which includes most information for a target host on a
single line, and sCRiPt KiDDi3 0utPUt. for users who
consider themselves |&lt;&minus;r4d.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
interactive output is the default and has no associated
command&minus;line options, the other four format options
use the same syntax. They take one argument, which is the
filename that results should be stored in. Multiple formats
may be specified, but each format may only be specified
once. For example, you may wish to save normal output for
your own review while saving XML of the same scan for
programmatic analysis. You might do this with the options
<b>&minus;oX myscan.xml &minus;oN myscan.nmap</b>. While
this chapter uses the simple names like myscan.xml for
brevity, more descriptive names are generally recommended.
The names chosen are a matter of personal preference, though
I use long ones that incorporate the scan date and a word or
two describing the scan, placed in a directory named after
the company I'm scanning.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
these options save results to files, Nmap still prints
interactive output to stdout as usual. For example, the
command <b>nmap &minus;oX myscan.xml target</b> prints XML
to myscan.xml and fills standard output with the same
interactive results it would have printed if
<b>&minus;oX</b> wasn't specified at all. You can change
this by passing a hyphen character as the argument to one of
the format types. This causes Nmap to deactivate interactive
output, and instead print results in the format you
specified to the standard output stream. So the command
<b>nmap &minus;oX &minus; target</b> will send only XML
output to stdout.. Serious errors may still be printed to
the normal error stream, stderr..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Unlike
some Nmap arguments, the space between the logfile option
flag (such as <b>&minus;oX</b>) and the filename or hyphen
is mandatory. If you omit the flags and give arguments such
as <b>&minus;oG&minus;</b> or <b>&minus;oXscan.xml</b>, a
backwards compatibility feature of Nmap will cause the
creation of <i>normal format</i> output files named G&minus;
and Xscan.xml respectively.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">All
of these arguments support <b>strftime</b>&minus;like.
conversions in the filename. %H, %M, %S, %m, %d, %y, and %Y
are all exactly the same as in <b>strftime</b>. %T is the
same as %H%M%S, %R is the same as %H%M, and %D is the same
as %m%d%y. A % followed by any other character just yields
that character (%% gives you a percent symbol). So
<b>&minus;oX 'scan&minus;%T&minus;%D.xml'</b> will use an
XML file with a name in the form of
scan&minus;144840&minus;121307.xml.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
also offers options to control scan verbosity and to append
to output files rather than clobbering them. All of these
options are described below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Nmap
Output Formats</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;oN</b>
<i>filespec</i> (normal output) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Requests
that normal output be directed to the given filename. As
discussed above, this differs slightly from interactive
output.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;oX</b>
<i>filespec</i> (XML output) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Requests
that XML output be directed to the given filename. Nmap
includes a document type definition (DTD) which allows XML
parsers to validate Nmap XML output. While it is primarily
intended for programmatic use, it can also help humans
interpret Nmap XML output. The DTD defines the legal
elements of the format, and often enumerates the attributes
and values they can take on. The latest version is always
available from</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">XML
offers a stable format that is easily parsed by software.
Free XML parsers are available for all major computer
languages, including C/C++, Perl, Python, and Java. People
have even written bindings for most of these languages to
handle Nmap output and execution specifically. Examples
are</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">Nmap::Scanner</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[15]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. and</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Nmap::Parser</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[16]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. in Perl CPAN. In almost all cases
that a non&minus;trivial application interfaces with Nmap,
XML is the preferred format.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
XML output references an XSL stylesheet which can be used to
format the results as HTML. The easiest way to use this is
simply to load the XML output in a web browser such as
Firefox or IE. By default, this will only work on the
machine you ran Nmap on (or a similarly configured one) due
to the hard&minus;coded nmap.xsl filesystem path. Use the
<b>&minus;&minus;webxml</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;stylesheet</b> options to create portable
XML files that render as HTML on any web&minus;connected
machine.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;oS</b>
<i>filespec</i> (ScRipT KIdd|3 oUTpuT) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Script
kiddie output is like interactive output, except that it is
post&minus;processed to better suit the l33t HaXXorZ who
previously looked down on Nmap due to its consistent
capitalization and spelling. Humor impaired people should
note that this option is making fun of the script kiddies
before flaming me for supposedly &ldquo;helping
them&rdquo;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;oG</b>
<i>filespec</i> (grepable output) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
output format is covered last because it is deprecated. The
XML output format is far more powerful, and is nearly as
convenient for experienced users. XML is a standard for
which dozens of excellent parsers are available, while
grepable output is my own simple hack. XML is extensible to
support new Nmap features as they are released, while I
often must omit those features from grepable output for lack
of a place to put them.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nevertheless,
grepable output is still quite popular. It is a simple
format that lists each host on one line and can be trivially
searched and parsed with standard Unix tools such as grep,
awk, cut, sed, diff, and Perl. Even I usually use it for
one&minus;off tests done at the command line. Finding all
the hosts with the SSH port open or that are running Solaris
takes only a simple grep to identify the hosts, piped to an
awk or cut command to print the desired fields.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Grepable
output consists of comments (lines starting with a pound
(#)). and target lines. A target line includes a combination
of six labeled fields, separated by tabs and followed with a
colon. The fields are Host, Ports, Protocols, Ignored State,
OS, Seq Index, IP ID, and Status.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
most important of these fields is generally Ports, which
gives details on each interesting port. It is a comma
separated list of port entries. Each port entry represents
one interesting port, and takes the form of seven slash (/)
separated subfields. Those subfields are: Port number,
State, Protocol, Owner, Service, SunRPC info, and Version
info.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">As
with XML output, this man page does not allow for
documenting the entire format. A more detailed look at the
Nmap grepable output format is available from</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/book/output-formats-grepable-output.html</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;oA</b>
<i>basename</i> (Output to all formats) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">As a
convenience, you may specify <b>&minus;oA</b>
<i>basename</i> to store scan results in normal, XML, and
grepable formats at once. They are stored in
<i>basename</i>.nmap, <i>basename</i>.xml, and
<i>basename</i>.gnmap, respectively. As with most programs,
you can prefix the filenames with a directory path, such as
~/nmaplogs/foocorp/ on Unix or c:\hacking\sco on
Windows.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Verbosity
and debugging options</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;v</b>
(Increase verbosity level) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Increases
the verbosity level, causing Nmap to print more information
about the scan in progress. Open ports are shown as they are
found and completion time estimates are provided when Nmap
thinks a scan will take more than a few minutes. Use it
twice or more for even greater verbosity: <b>&minus;vv</b>,
or give a verbosity level directly, for example
<b>&minus;v3</b>..</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Most
changes only affect interactive output, and some also affect
normal and script kiddie output. The other output types are
meant to be processed by machines, so Nmap can give
substantial detail by default in those formats without
fatiguing a human user. However, there are a few changes in
other modes where output size can be reduced substantially
by omitting some detail. For example, a comment line in the
grepable output that provides a list of all ports scanned is
only printed in verbose mode because it can be quite
long.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;d</b>
(Increase debugging level) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When even
verbose mode doesn't provide sufficient data for you,
debugging is available to flood you with much more! As with
the verbosity option (<b>&minus;v</b>), debugging is enabled
with a command&minus;line flag (<b>&minus;d</b>) and the
debug level can be increased by specifying it multiple
times,. as in <b>&minus;dd</b>, or by setting a level
directly. For example, <b>&minus;d9</b> sets level nine.
That is the highest effective level and will produce
thousands of lines unless you run a very simple scan with
very few ports and targets.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Debugging
output is useful when a bug is suspected in Nmap, or if you
are simply confused as to what Nmap is doing and why. As
this feature is mostly intended for developers, debug lines
aren't always self&minus;explanatory. You may get something
like: Timeout vals: srtt: &minus;1 rttvar: &minus;1 to:
1000000 delta 14987 ==&gt; srtt: 14987 rttvar: 14987 to:
100000. If you don't understand a line, your only recourses
are to ignore it, look it up in the source code, or request
help from the development list (nmap&minus;dev).. Some lines
are self explanatory, but the messages become more obscure
as the debug level is increased.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;reason</b>
(Host and port state reasons) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Shows the
reason each port is set to a specific state and the reason
each host is up or down. This option displays the type of
the packet that determined a port or hosts state. For
example, A RST packet from a closed port or an echo reply
from an alive host. The information Nmap can provide is
determined by the type of scan or ping. The SYN scan and SYN
ping (<b>&minus;sS</b> and <b>&minus;PS</b>) are very
detailed, but the TCP connect scan (<b>&minus;sT</b>) is
limited by the implementation of the <b>connect</b> system
call. This feature is automatically enabled by the debug
option (<b>&minus;d</b>). and the results are stored in XML
log files even if this option is not specified.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;stats&minus;every</b>
<i>time</i> (Print periodic timing stats) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Periodically
prints a timing status message after each interval of
<i>time</i>. The time is a specification of the kind
described in the section called &ldquo;TIMING AND
PERFORMANCE&rdquo;; so for example, use
<b>&minus;&minus;stats&minus;every 10s</b> to get a status
update every 10 seconds. Updates are printed to interactive
output (the screen) and XML output.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;packet&minus;trace</b>
(Trace packets and data sent and received) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Causes
Nmap to print a summary of every packet sent or received.
This is often used for debugging, but is also a valuable way
for new users to understand exactly what Nmap is doing under
the covers. To avoid printing thousands of lines, you may
want to specify a limited number of ports to scan, such as
<b>&minus;p20&minus;30</b>. If you only care about the
goings on of the version detection subsystem, use
<b>&minus;&minus;version&minus;trace</b> instead. If you
only care about script tracing, specify
<b>&minus;&minus;script&minus;trace</b>. With
<b>&minus;&minus;packet&minus;trace</b>, you get all of the
above.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;open</b>
(Show only open (or possibly open) ports) .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Sometimes
you only care about ports you can actually connect to (open
ones), and don't want results cluttered with closed,
filtered, and closed|filtered ports. Output customization is
normally done after the scan using tools such as grep, awk,
and Perl, but this feature was added due to overwhelming
requests. Specify <b>&minus;&minus;open</b> to only see
hosts with at least one open, open|filtered, or unfiltered
port, and only see ports in those states. These three states
are treated just as they normally are, which means that
open|filtered and unfiltered may be condensed into counts if
there are an overwhelming number of them.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;iflist</b>
(List interfaces and routes) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Prints
the interface list and system routes as detected by Nmap.
This is useful for debugging routing problems or device
mischaracterization (such as Nmap treating a PPP connection
as ethernet).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Miscellaneous
output options</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;append&minus;output</b>
(Append to rather than clobber output files) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When you
specify a filename to an output format flag such as
<b>&minus;oX</b> or <b>&minus;oN</b>, that file is
overwritten by default. If you prefer to keep the existing
content of the file and append the new results, specify the
<b>&minus;&minus;append&minus;output</b> option. All output
filenames specified in that Nmap execution will then be
appended to rather than clobbered. This doesn't work well
for XML (<b>&minus;oX</b>) scan data as the resultant file
generally won't parse properly until you fix it up by
hand.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;resume</b>
<i>filename</i> (Resume aborted scan) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Some
extensive Nmap runs take a very long time&mdash;on the order
of days. Such scans don't always run to completion.
Restrictions may prevent Nmap from being run during working
hours, the network could go down, the machine Nmap is
running on might suffer a planned or unplanned reboot, or
Nmap itself could crash. The administrator running Nmap
could cancel it for any other reason as well, by pressing
ctrl&minus;C. Restarting the whole scan from the beginning
may be undesirable. Fortunately, if normal
(<b>&minus;oN</b>) or grepable (<b>&minus;oG</b>) logs were
kept, the user can ask Nmap to resume scanning with the
target it was working on when execution ceased. Simply
specify the <b>&minus;&minus;resume</b> option and pass the
normal/grepable output file as its argument. No other
arguments are permitted, as Nmap parses the output file to
use the same ones specified previously. Simply call Nmap as
<b>nmap &minus;&minus;resume</b> <i>logfilename</i>. Nmap
will append new results to the data files specified in the
previous execution. Resumption does not support the XML
output format because combining the two runs into one valid
XML file would be difficult.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;stylesheet</b>
<i>path or URL</i> (Set XSL stylesheet to transform XML
output) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap
ships with an XSL. stylesheet. named nmap.xsl. for viewing
or translating XML output to HTML.. The XML output includes
an xml&minus;stylesheet directive which points to nmap.xml
where it was initially installed by Nmap. Run the XML file
through an XSLT processor such as</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">xsltproc</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[17]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. to produce an HTML file. Directly
opening the XML file in a browser no longer works well
because modern browsers limit the locations a stylesheet may
be loaded from. If you wish to use a different stylesheet,
specify it as the argument to
<b>&minus;&minus;stylesheet</b>. You must pass the full
pathname or URL. One common invocation is
<b>&minus;&minus;stylesheet
http://nmap.org/svn/docs/nmap.xsl</b>. This tells an XSLT
processor to load the latest version of the stylesheet from
Nmap.Org. The <b>&minus;&minus;webxml</b> option does the
same thing with less typing and memorization. Loading the
XSL from Nmap.Org makes it easier to view results on a
machine that doesn't have Nmap (and thus nmap.xsl)
installed. So the URL is often more useful, but the local
filesystem location of nmap.xsl is used by default for
privacy reasons.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;webxml</b>
(Load stylesheet from Nmap.Org) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This is a
convenience option, nothing more than an alias for
<b>&minus;&minus;stylesheet

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;stylesheet</b>
(Omit XSL stylesheet declaration from XML) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specify
this option to prevent Nmap from associating any XSL

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
<a name="MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
section describes some important (and
not&minus;so&minus;important) options that don't really fit
anywhere else.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;6</b>
(Enable IPv6 scanning) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap has
IPv6 support for its most popular features. Ping scanning,
port scanning, version detection, and the Nmap Scripting
Engine all support IPv6. The command syntax is the same as
usual except that you also add the <b>&minus;6</b> option.
Of course, you must use IPv6 syntax if you specify an
address rather than a hostname. An address might look like
3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0, so hostnames are
recommended. The output looks the same as usual, with the
IPv6 address on the &ldquo;interesting ports&rdquo; line
being the only IPv6 giveaway.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
IPv6 hasn't exactly taken the world by storm, it gets
significant use in some (usually Asian) countries and most
modern operating systems support it. To use Nmap with IPv6,
both the source and target of your scan must be configured
for IPv6. If your ISP (like most of them) does not allocate
IPv6 addresses to you, free tunnel brokers are widely
available and work fine with Nmap. I use the free IPv6
tunnel broker. service at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://www.tunnelbroker.net</font></b><font color="#000000">.
Other tunnel brokers are</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">listed at Wikipedia</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[18]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. 6to4 tunnels are another popular,
free approach.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">On
Windows, raw&minus;socket IPv6 scans are supported only on
ethernet devices (not tunnels), and only on Windows Vista.
and later. Use the <b>&minus;&minus;unprivileged</b>. option
in other situations.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;A</b>
(Aggressive scan options) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option enables additional advanced and aggressive options. I
haven't decided exactly which it stands for yet. Presently
this enables OS detection (<b>&minus;O</b>), version
scanning (<b>&minus;sV</b>), script scanning
(<b>&minus;sC</b>) and traceroute
(<b>&minus;&minus;traceroute</b>).. More features may be
added in the future. The point is to enable a comprehensive
set of scan options without people having to remember a
large set of flags. However, because script scanning with
the default set is considered intrusive, you should not use
<b>&minus;A</b> against target networks without permission.
This option only enables features, and not timing options
(such as <b>&minus;T4</b>) or verbosity options
(<b>&minus;v</b>) that you might want as well.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;datadir</b>
<i>directoryname</i> (Specify custom Nmap data file
location) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Nmap
obtains some special data at runtime in files named
nmap&minus;service&minus;probes, nmap&minus;services,
nmap&minus;protocols, nmap&minus;rpc,
nmap&minus;mac&minus;prefixes, and nmap&minus;os&minus;db.
If the location of any of these files has been specified
(using the <b>&minus;&minus;servicedb</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;versiondb</b> options), that location is
used for that file. After that, Nmap searches these files in
the directory specified with the
<b>&minus;&minus;datadir</b> option (if any). Any files not
found there, are searched for in the directory specified by
the <b>NMAPDIR</b>. environment variable. Next comes
~/.nmap. for real and effective UIDs; or on Windows,
<i>HOME</i>\AppData\Roaming\nmap (where <i>HOME</i> is the
user's home directory, like C:\Users\user). This is followed
by the location of the nmap executable and the same location
with ../share/nmap appended. Then a compiled&minus;in
location such as /usr/local/share/nmap or
/usr/share/nmap.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;servicedb</b>
<i>services file</i> (Specify custom services file)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Asks Nmap
to use the specified services file rather than the
nmap&minus;services data file that comes with Nmap. Using
this option also causes a fast scan (<b>&minus;F</b>) to be
used. See the description for <b>&minus;&minus;datadir</b>
for more information on Nmap's data files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;versiondb</b>
<i>service probes file</i> (Specify custom service probes
file) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Asks Nmap
to use the specified service probes file rather than the
nmap&minus;service&minus;probes data file that comes with
Nmap. See the description for <b>&minus;&minus;datadir</b>
for more information on Nmap's data files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;eth</b>
(Use raw ethernet sending) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Asks Nmap
to send packets at the raw ethernet (data link) layer rather
than the higher IP (network) layer. By default, Nmap chooses
the one which is generally best for the platform it is
running on. Raw sockets (IP layer). are generally most
efficient for Unix machines, while ethernet frames are
required for Windows operation since Microsoft disabled raw
socket support. Nmap still uses raw IP packets on Unix
despite this option when there is no other choice (such as
non&minus;ethernet connections).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;ip</b>
(Send at raw IP level) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Asks Nmap
to send packets via raw IP sockets rather than sending lower
level ethernet frames. It is the complement to the
<b>&minus;&minus;send&minus;eth</b> option discussed
previously.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;privileged</b>
(Assume that the user is fully privileged) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Tells
Nmap to simply assume that it is privileged enough to
perform raw socket sends, packet sniffing, and similar
operations that usually require root privileges. on Unix
systems. By default Nmap quits if such operations are
requested but <b>geteuid</b> is not zero.
<b>&minus;&minus;privileged</b> is useful with Linux kernel
capabilities and similar systems that may be configured to
allow unprivileged users to perform raw&minus;packet scans.
Be sure to provide this option flag before any flags for
options that require privileges (SYN scan, OS detection,
etc.). The <b>NMAP_PRIVILEGED</b>. environment variable may
be set as an equivalent alternative to
<b>&minus;&minus;privileged</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;unprivileged</b>
(Assume that the user lacks raw socket privileges)
.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option is the opposite of <b>&minus;&minus;privileged</b>.
It tells Nmap to treat the user as lacking network raw
socket and sniffing privileges. This is useful for testing,
debugging, or when the raw network functionality of your
operating system is somehow broken. The
<b>NMAP_UNPRIVILEGED</b>. environment variable may be set as
an equivalent alternative to
<b>&minus;&minus;unprivileged</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>&minus;&minus;release&minus;memory</b>
(Release memory before quitting) .</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This
option is only useful for memory&minus;leak debugging. It
causes Nmap to release allocated memory just before it quits
so that actual memory leaks are easier to spot. Normally
Nmap skips this as the OS does this anyway upon process

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Here
are some Nmap usage examples, from the simple and routine to
a little more complex and esoteric. Some actual IP addresses
and domain names are used to make things more concrete. In
their place you should substitute addresses/names from
<i>your own network</i>. While I don't think port scanning
other networks is or should be illegal, some network
administrators don't appreciate unsolicited scanning of
their networks and may complain. Getting permission first is
the best approach.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
testing purposes, you have permission to scan the host
scanme.nmap.org.. This permission only includes scanning via
Nmap and not testing exploits or denial of service attacks.
To conserve bandwidth, please do not initiate more than a
dozen scans against that host per day. If this free scanning
target service is abused, it will be taken down and Nmap
will report Failed to resolve given hostname/IP:
scanme.nmap.org. These permissions also apply to the hosts
scanme2.nmap.org, scanme3.nmap.org, and so on, though those
hosts do not currently exist.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine
scanme.nmap.org . The <b>&minus;v</b> option enables verbose
mode.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Launches
a stealth SYN scan against each machine that is up out of
the 256 IPs on the class C sized network where Scanme
resides. It also tries to determine what operating system is
running on each host that is up and running. This requires
root privileges because of the SYN scan and OS
detection.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Launches
host enumeration and a TCP scan at the first half of each of
the 255 possible eight&minus;bit subnets in the 198.116
class B address space. This tests whether the systems run
SSH, DNS, POP3, or IMAP on their standard ports, or anything
on port 4564. For any of these ports found open, version
detection is used to determine what application is
running.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Asks
Nmap to choose 100,000 hosts at random and scan them for web
servers (port 80). Host enumeration is disabled with
<b>&minus;Pn</b> since first sending a couple probes to
determine whether a host is up is wasteful when you are only
probing one port on each target host anyway.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
scans 4096 IPs for any web servers (without pinging them)
and saves the output in grepable and XML formats.</font></p>

<h2>NMAP BOOK
<a name="NMAP BOOK"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">While
this reference guide details all material Nmap options, it
can't fully demonstrate how to apply those features to
quickly solve real&minus;world tasks. For that, we released
Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to
Network Discovery and Security Scanning. Topics include
subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common
networking tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and
instructions are provided for common Nmap tasks such as
taking network inventory, penetration testing, detecting
rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication
on the wire. More than half of the book is available free
online. See</font>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Like
its author, Nmap isn't perfect. But you can help make it
better by sending bug reports or even writing patches. If
Nmap doesn't behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the
latest version available from</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org</font></b><font color="#000000">.
If the problem persists, do some research to determine
whether it has already been discovered and addressed. Try
searching for the error message on our search page at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://insecure.org/search.html</font></b>
<font color="#000000">or at Google. Also try browsing the
nmap&minus;dev archives at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://seclists.org/</font></b><font color="#000000">..
Read this full manual page as well. If nothing comes of
this, mail a bug report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. Please
include everything you have learned about the problem, as
well as what version of Nmap you are running and what
operating system version it is running on. Problem reports
and Nmap usage questions sent to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt; are
far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor
directly. If you subscribe to the nmap&minus;dev list before
posting, your message will bypass moderation and get through
more quickly. Subscribe at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">http://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev</font></b><font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Code
patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic
instructions for creating patch files with your changes are
available at</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING</font></b><font color="#000000">.

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
should also be noted that Nmap has occasionally been known
to crash poorly written applications, TCP/IP stacks, and
even operating systems.. While this is extremely rare, it is
important to keep in mind. <i>Nmap should never be run
against mission critical systems</i> unless you are prepared
to suffer downtime. We acknowledge here that Nmap may crash
your systems or networks and we disclaim all liability for
any damage or problems Nmap could cause.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Inappropriate
Usage</b> <br>
Because of the slight risk of crashes and because a few
black hats like to use Nmap for reconnaissance prior to
attacking systems, there are administrators who become upset
and may complain when their system is scanned. Thus, it is
often advisable to request permission before doing even a
light scan of a network.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Nmap
should never be installed with special privileges (e.g. suid
root).. That would open up a major security vulnerability as
other users on the system (or attackers) could use it for
privilege escalation.</font></p>
