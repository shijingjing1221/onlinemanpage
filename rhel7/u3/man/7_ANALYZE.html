<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ANALYZE &minus;
collect statistics about a database</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ANALYZE [
VERBOSE ] [ <i>table_name</i> [ ( <i>column_name</i> [, ...]
) ] ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ANALYZE</b>
collects statistics about the contents of tables in the
database, and stores the results in the pg_statistic system
catalog. Subsequently, the query planner uses these
statistics to help determine the most efficient execution
plans for queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With no
parameter, <b>ANALYZE</b> examines every table in the
current database. With a parameter, <b>ANALYZE</b> examines
only that table. It is further possible to give a list of
column names, in which case only the statistics for those
columns are collected.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VERBOSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables display of progress
messages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (possibly
schema&minus;qualified) of a specific table to analyze. If
omitted, all regular tables (but not foreign tables) in the
current database are analyzed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>column_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of a specific column
to analyze. Defaults to all columns.</p>

<h2>OUTPUTS
<a name="OUTPUTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When VERBOSE is
specified, <b>ANALYZE</b> emits progress messages to
indicate which table is currently being processed. Various
statistics about the tables are printed as well.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Foreign tables
are analyzed only when explicitly selected. Not all foreign
data wrappers support <b>ANALYZE</b>. If the table's wrapper
does not support <b>ANALYZE</b>, the command prints a
warning and does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the default
PostgreSQL configuration, the autovacuum daemon (see Section
23.1.6, &ldquo;The Autovacuum Daemon&rdquo;, in the
documentation) takes care of automatic analyzing of tables
when they are first loaded with data, and as they change
throughout regular operation. When autovacuum is disabled,
it is a good idea to run <b>ANALYZE</b> periodically, or
just after making major changes in the contents of a table.
Accurate statistics will help the planner to choose the most
appropriate query plan, and thereby improve the speed of
query processing. A common strategy for read&minus;mostly
databases is to run <b>VACUUM</b>(7) and <b>ANALYZE</b> once
a day during a low&minus;usage time of day. (This will not
be sufficient if there is heavy update activity.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ANALYZE</b>
requires only a read lock on the target table, so it can run
in parallel with other activity on the table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The statistics
collected by <b>ANALYZE</b> usually include a list of some
of the most common values in each column and a histogram
showing the approximate data distribution in each column.
One or both of these can be omitted if <b>ANALYZE</b> deems
them uninteresting (for example, in a unique&minus;key
column, there are no common values) or if the column data
type does not support the appropriate operators. There is
more information about the statistics in Chapter 23, Routine
Database Maintenance Tasks, in the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For large
tables, <b>ANALYZE</b> takes a random sample of the table
contents, rather than examining every row. This allows even
very large tables to be analyzed in a small amount of time.
Note, however, that the statistics are only approximate, and
will change slightly each time <b>ANALYZE</b> is run, even
if the actual table contents did not change. This might
result in small changes in the planner's estimated costs
shown by <b>EXPLAIN</b>(7). In rare situations, this
non&minus;determinism will cause the planner's choices of
query plans to change after <b>ANALYZE</b> is run. To avoid
this, raise the amount of statistics collected by
<b>ANALYZE</b>, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The extent of
analysis can be controlled by adjusting the
default_statistics_target configuration variable, or on a
column&minus;by&minus;column basis by setting the
per&minus;column statistics target with <b>ALTER TABLE ...
ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</b> (see ALTER TABLE
(<b>ALTER_TABLE</b>(7))). The target value sets the maximum
number of entries in the most&minus;common&minus;value list
and the maximum number of bins in the histogram. The default
target value is 100, but this can be adjusted up or down to
trade off accuracy of planner estimates against the time
taken for <b>ANALYZE</b> and the amount of space occupied in
pg_statistic. In particular, setting the statistics target
to zero disables collection of statistics for that column.
It might be useful to do that for columns that are never
used as part of the WHERE, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses of
queries, since the planner will have no use for statistics
on such columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The largest
statistics target among the columns being analyzed
determines the number of table rows sampled to prepare the
statistics. Increasing the target causes a proportional
increase in the time and space needed to do
<b>ANALYZE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
values estimated by <b>ANALYZE</b> is the number of distinct
values that appear in each column. Because only a subset of
the rows are examined, this estimate can sometimes be quite
inaccurate, even with the largest possible statistics
target. If this inaccuracy leads to bad query plans, a more
accurate value can be determined manually and then installed
with <b>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET (n_distinct =
...)</b> (see ALTER TABLE (<b>ALTER_TABLE</b>(7))).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the table
being analyzed has one or more children, <b>ANALYZE</b> will
gather statistics twice: once on the rows of the parent
table only, and a second time on the rows of the parent
table with all of its children. This second set of
statistics is needed when planning queries that traverse the
entire inheritance tree. The autovacuum daemon, however,
will only consider inserts or updates on the parent table
itself when deciding whether to trigger an automatic analyze
for that table. If that table is rarely inserted into or
updated, the inheritance statistics will not be up to date
unless you run <b>ANALYZE</b> manually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the table
being analyzed is completely empty, <b>ANALYZE</b> will not
record new statistics for that table. Any existing
statistics will be retained.</p>
