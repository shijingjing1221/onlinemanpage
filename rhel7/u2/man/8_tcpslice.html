<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Tcpslice</i>
is a program for extracting portions of packet-trace files
generated using <i>tcpdump(l)</i>&rsquo;s <b>&minus;w</b>
flag. It can also be used to merge together several such
files, as discussed below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
operation of <i>tcpslice</i> is to copy to <i>stdout</i> all
packets from its input file(s) whose timestamps fall within
a given range. The starting and ending times of the range
may be specified on the command line. All ranges are
inclusive. The starting time defaults to the earliest time
of the first packet in any of the input files; we call this
the <i>first time.</i> The ending time defaults to ten years
after the starting time. Thus, the command <i>tcpslice
trace-file</i> simply copies <i>trace-file</i> to
<i>stdout</i> (assuming the file does not include more than
ten years&rsquo; worth of data).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of ways to specify times. The first is using Unix
timestamps of the form <i>sssssssss.uuuuuu</i> (this is the
format specified by <i>tcpdump</i>&rsquo;s <b>&minus;tt</b>
flag). For example, <b>654321098.7654</b> specifies 38
seconds and 765,400 microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25,
1990.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All examples in
this manual are given for PDT times, but when displaying
times and interpreting times symbolically as discussed
below, <i>tcpslice</i> uses the local timezone, regardless
of the timezone in which the <i>tcpdump</i> file was
generated. The daylight-savings setting used is that which
is appropriate for the local timezone at the date in
question. For example, times associated with summer months
will usually include daylight-savings effects, and those
with winter months will not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Times may also
be specified relative to either the <i>first time</i> (when
specifying a starting time) or the starting time (when
specifying an ending time) by preceding a numeric value in
seconds with a &lsquo;+&rsquo;. For example, a starting time
of <b>+200</b> indicates 200 seconds after the <i>first
time,</i> and the two arguments <b>+200 +300</b> indicate
from 200 seconds after the <i>first time</i> through 500
seconds after the <i>first time.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Times may also
be specified in terms of years (y), months (m), days (d),
hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), and microseconds(u).
For example, the Unix timestamp 654321098.7654 discussed
above could also be expressed as
<b>1990y9m25d20h51m38s765400u.</b> 2 or 4 digit years may be
used; 2 digits can specify years from 1970 to 2069.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When specifying
times using this style, fields that are omitted default as
follows. If the omitted field is a unit <i>greater</i> than
that of the first specified field, then its value defaults
to the corresponding value taken from either <i>first
time</i> (if the starting time is being specified) or the
starting time (if the ending time is being specified). If
the omitted field is a unit <i>less</i> than that of the
first specified field, then it defaults to zero. For
example, suppose that the input file has a <i>first time</i>
of the Unix timestamp mentioned above, i.e., 38 seconds and
765,400 microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990. To
specify 9:36PM PDT (exactly) on the same date we could use
<b>21h36m.</b> To specify a range from 9:36PM PDT through
1:54AM PDT the next day we could use <b>21h36m
26d1h54m.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Relative times
can also be specified when using the <i>ymdhmsu</i> format.
Omitted fields then default to 0 if the unit of the field is
<i>greater</i> than that of the first specified field, and
to the corresponding value taken from either the <i>first
time</i> or the starting time if the omitted field&rsquo;s
unit is <i>less</i> than that of the first specified field.
Given a <i>first time</i> of the Unix timestamp mentioned
above, <b>22h +1h10m</b> specifies a range from 10:00PM PDT
on that date through 11:10PM PDT, and <b>+1h +1h10m</b>
specifies a range from 38.7654 seconds after 9:51PM PDT
through 38.7654 seconds after 11:01PM PDT. The first hour of
the file could be extracted using <b>+0 +1h.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that with
the <i>ymdhmsu</i> format there is an ambiguity between
using <i>m</i> for &lsquo;month&rsquo; or for
&lsquo;minute&rsquo;. The ambiguity is resolved as follows:
if an <i>m</i> field is followed by a <i>d</i> field then it
is interpreted as specifying months; otherwise it specifies
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one input file is specified then <i>tcpslice</i> merges the
packets from the various input files into the single output
file. Normally, this merge is done based on the value of the
timestamps in the packets in the individual files. (Tcpslice
assumes that <i>within</i> each input file, packets are in
timestamp order.) If the <b>&minus;l</b> option is used, the
value used for ordering is the timestamp of a given packet
minus the timestamp of the first packet in the input file in
which the given packet occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When merging
files, by default <i>tcpslice</i> will discard any
<i>duplicate</i> packet it finds in more than one file. A
duplicate is a packet that has an identical timestamp
(either relative or absolute) and identical packet contents
(for as much as was captured) as another packet previously
seen in a different file. Note that it is possible for the
network to generate true replicates of packets, and for
systems that can return the same timestamp for multiple
packets, these can be mistaken for duplicates and discarded.
Accordingly, <i>tcpslice</i> will not discard duplicates in
the same trace file. In addition, you can use the
<b>&minus;D</b> option to suppress any discarding of
duplicates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A different
issue arises if a file contains timestamps that skip
backwards. <i>tcpslice</i> will include these in the output,
even if they precede the minimum time requested. There
should probably be an option to suppress these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another problem
relating to backwards timestamps is that <i>tcpslice</i>
uses random access to seek through a file looking for
packets corresponding to the desired range of time. While
doing so leads to a major performance benefit for very large
trace files, it also means that in the presence of backwards
timestamps <i>tcpslice</i> can fail to find the true
earliest occurrence of a packet matching the time interval
criteria. There should probably be an option to specify not
to use random access but just read the file linearly.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any of
<b>&minus;R, &minus;r</b> or <b>&minus;t</b> are specified
then <i>tcpslice</i> reports the timestamps of the first and
last packets in each input file and exits. Only one of these
three options may be specified.</p>

<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Dump the start and end times specified by the given
range and exit. This option is useful for checking that the
given range actually specifies the times you think it does.
If one of <b>&minus;R, &minus;r</b> or <b>&minus;t</b> has
been specified then the times are dumped in the
corresponding format; otherwise, raw format (
<b>&minus;R</b>) is used.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p><b>&minus;l</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When merging more than one file, merge on the basis of
relative time, rather than absolute time. Normally, when
merging files is done, packets are merged based on absolute
timestamps. With <b>&minus;l</b> packets are merged based on
the relative time between the start of the file in which the
packet is found and the timestamp of the packet itself. The
timestamp of packets in the output file is calculated as the
relative time for the packet within its file plus <i>first
time.</i></p> </td></tr>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please send bug
reports to tcpslice@ee.lbl.gov.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An input
filename that beings with a digit or a &lsquo;+&rsquo; can
be confused with a start/end time. Such filenames can be
specified with a leading &lsquo;./&rsquo;; for example,
specify the file &lsquo;04Jul76.trace&rsquo; as
&lsquo;./04Jul76.trace&rsquo;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>tcpslice</i>
cannot read its input from <i>stdin</i>, since it uses
random-access to rummage through its input files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>tcpslice</i>
refuses to write to its output if it is a terminal (as
indicated by <i>isatty(3)</i>). This is not a bug but a
feature, to prevent it from spraying binary data to the
user&rsquo;s terminal. Note that this means you must either
redirect <i>stdout</i> or specify an output file via
<b>&minus;w</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>tcpslice</i>
will not work properly on <i>tcpdump</i> files spanning more
than one year; with files containing portions of packets
whose original length was more than 65,535 bytes; nor with
files containing fewer than two packets. Such files result
in the error message: &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t find final
packet in file&rsquo;. These problems are due to the
interpolation scheme used by <i>tcpslice</i> to greatly
speed up its processing when dealing with large trace files.
Note that <i>tcpslice</i> can efficiently extract slices
from the middle of trace files of any size, and can also
work with truncated trace files (i.e., the final packet in
the file is only partially present, typically due to
<i>tcpdump</i> being ungracefully killed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adding
<b>&minus;l</b> has broken some compatibility with older
versions, since <i>tcpslice</i> now merges its input files,
rather than (approximately) concatenating them together as
it did previously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It would
sometimes be convenient if you could specify a clock offset
to use with the <b>&minus;l</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It would be
nice if <i>tcpslice</i> supported more general editing of
trace files.</p>
