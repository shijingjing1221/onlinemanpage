<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Codes
&minus; a distribution of modules to handle locale codes</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Locale-Codes</b>
is a distribution containing a set of modules. The modules
each deal with different types of codes which identify parts
of the locale including languages, countries, currency,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, the
following modules are included: <b><br>
Locale::Codes::Country, Locale::Country</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
country codes (such as those listed in
<small>ISO&minus;3166</small> ) to specify the country.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
module was originally distributed as Locale::Country, it is
also available under that name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::Language,
Locale::Language</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
language codes (such as those listed in
<small>ISO&minus;639</small> ) to specify the language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
module was originally distributed as Locale::Language, it is
also available under that name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::Currency,
Locale::Currency</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
currency codes (such as those listed in
<small>ISO&minus;4217</small> ) to specify the currency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
module was originally distributed as Locale::Currency, it is
also available under that name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::Script,
Locale::Script</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
script codes (such as those listed in
<small>ISO&minus;15924</small> ) to specify the script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
module was originally distributed as Locale::Script, it is
also available under that name.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::LangExt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
language extension codes (such as those listed in the
<small>IANA</small> language registry) to specify the
language extension.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::LangVar</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
language variation codes (such as those listed in the
<small>IANA</small> language registry) to specify the
language variation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale::Codes::LangFam</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This includes support for
language family codes (such as those listed in <small>ISO
639&minus;5</small> ) to specify families of languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each module can
support an arbitrary number of code sets, and it is not
required that the relationship between these code sets be
one-to-one. For example, the Locale::Codes::Country module
supports code sets from <small>ISO&minus;3166</small> and
the <small>FIPS 10</small> standard, and they do not break
the world down into exactly the same sets of countries. This
does not cause any problem (though converting codes from
<small>ISO&minus;3166</small> to <small>FIPS</small> or back
will not work except for countries that are one-to-one).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All data in all
of these modules comes directly from the original standards
(or as close to direct as possible), so it should be
up-to-date at the time of release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I plan on
releasing a new version several times a year to incorporate
any changes made in the standards. However, I don&rsquo;t
always know about changes that occur, so if any of the
standards change, and you want a new release sooner, just
email me and I&rsquo;ll get one out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the modules above, there are a number of support modules
included in the distribution including: <b><br>
Locale::Codes <br>
Locale::Codes::Constants <br>
Locale::Codes::Country_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::Language_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::Currency_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::Script_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::LangExt_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::LangVar_codes <br>
Locale::Codes::LangFam_codes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These modules
are not intended to be used by programmers. They contain
functions or data that are used by the modules listed
above.</p>

<h2>NEW CODE SETS
<a name="NEW CODE SETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;m
always open to suggestions for new code sets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order for me
to add a code set, I want the following criteria to be met:
<b><br>
General-use code set</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a code set is not general
use, I&rsquo;m not likely to spend the time to add and
support it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>An official source of
data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">I require an official (or at
least, a <small>NEARLY</small> official) source where I can
get the data on a regular basis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Ideally,
I&rsquo;d only get data from an official source, but
sometimes that is not possible. For example the
<small>ISO</small> standards are not typically available for
free, so I may have to get some of that data from alternate
sources that I&rsquo;m confident are getting their data from
the official source. However, I will always be hesitant to
accept a non-official source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
I used to get some country data from the <small>CIA</small>
World Factbook. Given the nature of the source, I&rsquo;m
sure they&rsquo;re updating data from the official sources
and I consider it &quot;nearly&quot; official. However, even
in this case, I found that they were adding codes that were
not part of the standard, so I have stopped using them as a
source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
3rd party sites which maintain lists (many of which are
actually in a more convenient form than the official sites).
Unfortunately, I will reject most of them since I have no
feel for how &quot;official&quot; they are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>A free source of the
data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Obviously, the data must be
free-of-charge. I&rsquo;m not interested in paying for the
data (and I&rsquo;m not interested in the overhead of having
someone else pay for the data for me).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>A reliable source of
data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The source of data must come
from a source that I can reasonably expect to exist for the
foreseeable future since I will be extremely reluctant to
drop support for a data set once it&rsquo;s included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I am also
reluctant to accept data sent to me by an individual.
Although I appreciate the offer, it is simply not practical
to consider an individual contribution as a reliable source
of data. The source should be an official agency of some
sort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
requirements are open to discussion. If you have a code set
you&rsquo;d like to see added, but which may not meet all of
the above requirements, feel free to email me and
we&rsquo;ll discuss it. Depending on circumstances, I may be
willing to waive some of these criteria.</p>

<h2>COMMON ALIASES
<a name="COMMON ALIASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
2.00, the modules supported common variants of names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
Locale::Country supports variant names for countries, and a
few of the most common ones are included in the data. The
country code for &quot;United States&quot; is
&quot;us&quot;, so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   country2code('United States');
      =&gt; &quot;us&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now the
following will also return &rsquo;us&rsquo;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   country2code('United States of America');
   country2code('USA');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
common aliases may be included in the data, in addition to
the names that come directly from the standards. If you have
a common alias for a country, language, or any other of the
types of codes, let me know and I&rsquo;ll add it, with some
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the country name &quot;North Korea&quot; never appeared in
any of the official sources (instead, it was &quot;Korea,
North&quot; or &quot;Korea, Democratic People&rsquo;s
Republic of&quot;. I would honor a request to add an alias
&quot;North Korea&quot; since that&rsquo;s a very common way
to specify the country (please don&rsquo;t request this...
I&rsquo;ve already added it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, a request to add Zaire as an alias for &quot;Congo,
The Democratic Republic of&quot; will not be honored. The
country&rsquo;s official name is no longer Zaire, so adding
it as an alias violates the standard. Zaire was kept as an
alias in versions prior to 3.00, but it has been removed.
Other aliases (if any) which no longer appear in any
standard (and which are not common variations of the name in
the standards) have also been removed.</p>

<h2>DEPRECATED CODES
<a name="DEPRECATED CODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Occasionally, a
code is deprecated, but it may still be desirable to have
access to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although there
is no way to see every code that has ever existed and been
deprecated (since most codesets do not have that information
available), as of version 3.20, every code which has ever
been included in these modules can be referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information, refer to the documentation on the code2XXX,
XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names function in the
<b>Locale::Codes::API</b> documentation.</p>
