<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg3_utils is a
package of utilities that send SCSI commands to the given
<i>DEVICE</i> via a SCSI pass through interface provided by
the host operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
all utilities start with &quot;sg&quot; and most start with
&quot;sg_&quot; often followed by the name, or a shortening
of the name, of the SCSI command that they send. For example
the &quot;sg_verify&quot; utility sends the SCSI VERIFY
command. A mapping between SCSI commands and the sg3_utils
utilities that issue them is shown in the COVERAGE file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI draft
standards can be found at http://www.t10.org . The standards
themselves can be purchased from ANSI and other standards
organizations. A good overview of various SCSI standards can
be seen in http://www.t10.org/scsi&minus;3.htm with the SCSI
command sets in the upper part of the diagram. SCSI commands
in common with all device types can be found in SPC of which
SPC&minus;4 is the latest major version. Block device
specific commands (e.g. as used by disks) are in SBC, those
for tape drives in SSC and those for CD/DVD/BD drives in
MMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is becoming
more common to control ATA disks with the SCSI command set.
This involves the translation of SCSI commands to their
corresponding ATA equivalents (and that is an imperfect
mapping in some cases). The relevant standard is called SCSI
to ATA Translation (SAT and SAT&minus;2 are now standards at
INCITS(ANSI) and ISO while SAT&minus;3 is at the draft
stage). The logic to perform the command translation is
often called a SAT Layer or SATL and may be within an
operating system, in host bus adapter firmware or in an
external device (e.g. associated with a SAS expander). See
http://www.t10.org for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
support for SCSI tape devices but not for their basic
commands. The reader is referred to the &quot;mt&quot;
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
generations of command line option usage. The newer
utilities (written since July 2004) use the getopt_long()
function to parse command line options. With that function,
each option has two representations: a short form (e.g.
&rsquo;&minus;v&rsquo;) and a longer form (e.g.
&rsquo;&minus;&minus;verbose&rsquo;). If an argument is
required then it follows a space (optionally) in the short
form and a &quot;=&quot; in the longer form (e.g. in the
sg_verify utility &rsquo;&minus;l 2a6h&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&minus;&minus;lba=2a6h&rsquo; are equivalent). Note
that with getopt_long(), short form options can be elided,
for example: &rsquo;&minus;all&rsquo; is equivalent to
&rsquo;&minus;a &minus;l &minus;l&rsquo;. The <i>DEVICE</i>
argument may appear after, between or prior to any
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The older
utilities, such as sg_inq, had individual command line
processing code typically based on a single
&quot;&minus;&quot; followed by one or more characters. If
an argument is needed then it follows a &quot;=&quot; (e.g.
&rsquo;&minus;p=1f&rsquo; in sg_modes with its older
interface). Various options can be elided as long as it is
not ambiguous (e.g. &rsquo;&minus;vv&rsquo; to increase the
verbosity).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Over time the
command line interface of these older utilities became messy
and overloaded with options. So in sg3_utils version 1.23
the command line interface of these older utilities was
altered to have both a cleaner getopt_long() interface and
their older interface for backward compatibility. By default
these older utilities use their getopt_long() based
interface. That can be overridden by defining the
SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;&minus;O&rsquo; or &rsquo;&minus;&minus;old&rsquo; as
the first command line option. The man pages of the older
utilities documents the details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
sg3_utils utilities are based on the Unix dd command (e.g.
sg_dd) and permit copying data at the level of SCSI READ and
WRITE commands. sg_dd is tightly bound to Linux and hence is
not ported to other OSes. A more generic utility (than
sg_dd) called ddpt in a package of the same name has been
ported to other OSes.</p>

<h2>LINUX DEVICE NAMING
<a name="LINUX DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normal disk
block devices have names like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc,
etc. SCSI disks in Linux have always had names like that but
in recent Linux kernels (e.g. lk 2.6 series) it is becoming
more common for almost all disks to be named like that.
Partitions within a disk are specified by a number appended
to the device name, starting at 1 (e.g. /dev/sda1 ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tape drives are
named /dev/st&lt;num&gt; or /dev/nst&lt;num&gt; where
&lt;num&gt; starts at zero. Additionally one letter from
this list: &quot;lma&quot; may be appended to the name. CD,
DVD and BD readers (and writers) are named
/dev/sr&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; start at zero. There
are less used SCSI device type names, the dmesg and the
lsscsi commands may help to find if any are attached to a
running system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
SCSI device driver which offers alternate generic access to
SCSI devices. It uses names of the form /dev/sg&lt;num&gt;
where &lt;num&gt; starts at zero. The &quot;lsscsi
&minus;g&quot; command may be useful in finding these and
which generic name corresponds to a device type name (e.g.
/dev/sg2 may correspond to /dev/sda). In the lk 2.6 series a
block SCSI generic driver was introduced and its names are
of the form /dev/bsg/&lt;h:c:t:l&gt; where h, c, t and l are
numbers. Again see the lsscsi command to find the
correspondence between that SCSI tuple (i.e.
&lt;h:c:t:l&gt;) and alternate device names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to the
Linux kernel 2.6 series these utilities could only use
generic device names (e.g. /dev/sg1 ). In almost all cases
in the Linux kernel 2.6 series, any device name can be used
by these utilities.</p>

<h2>WINDOWS DEVICE NAMING
<a name="WINDOWS DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Storage and
related devices can have several device names in Windows.
Probably the most common in the volume name (e.g.
&quot;D:&quot;). There are also a &quot;class&quot; device
names such as &quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot;,
&quot;CDROM&lt;n&gt;&quot; and &quot;TAPE&lt;n&gt;&quot;.
&lt;n&gt; is an integer starting at 0 allocated in ascending
order as devices are discovered (and sometimes
rediscovered).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some storage
devices have a SCSI lower level device name which starts
with a SCSI (pseudo) adapter name of the form
&quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&quot;. To this is added
sub&minus;addressing in the form of a &quot;bus&quot;
number, a &quot;target&quot; identifier and a LUN (Logical
Unit Number). The &quot;bus&quot; number is also known as a
&quot;PathId&quot;. These are assembled to form a device
name of the form:
&quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&lt;bus&gt;,&lt;target&gt;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot;.
The trailing &quot;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot; may be omitted in
which case a LUN of zero is assumed. This lower level device
name cannot often be used directly since Windows blocks
attempts to use it if a class driver has &quot;claimed&quot;
the device. There are SCSI device types (e.g.
Automation/Drive interface type) for which there is no class
driver. At least two transports (&quot;bus types&quot; in
Windows jargon): USB and IEEE 1394 do not have a
&quot;scsi&quot; device names of this form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In keeping with
DOS file system conventions, the various device names can be
given in upper, lower or mixed case. Since
&quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot; is tedious to write, a
shortened form of &quot;PD&lt;n&gt;&quot; is permitted by
all utilities in this package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A single device
(e.g. a disk) can have many device names. For example:
&quot;PD0&quot; can also be &quot;C:&quot;, &quot;D:&quot;
and &quot;SCSI0:0,1,0&quot;. The two volume names reflect
that the disk has two partitions on it. Disk partitions that
are not recognized by Windows are not usually given a volume
name. However Vista does show a volume name for a disk which
has no partitions recognized by it and when selected invites
the user to format it (which may be rather unfriendly to
other OSes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These utilities
assume a given device name is in the Win32 device namespace.
To make that explicit &quot;\\.\&quot; can be prepended to
the device names mentioned in this section. Beware that
backslash is an escape character in Unix like shells and the
C programming language. In a shell like Msys (from MinGW)
each backslash may need to be typed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sg_scan
utility within this package lists out Windows device names
in a form that is suitable for other utilities in this
package to use.</p>

<h2>FREEBSD DEVICE NAMING
<a name="FREEBSD DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI disks have
block names of the form /dev/da&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt;
is an integer starting at zero. The &quot;da&quot; is
replaced by &quot;sa&quot; for SCSI tape drives and
&quot;cd&quot; for SCSI CD/DVD/BD drives. Each SCSI device
has a corresponding pass&minus;through device name of the
form /dev/pass&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is an integer
starting at zero. The &quot;camcontrol devlist&quot; command
may be useful for finding out which SCSI device names are
available and the correspondence between class and
pass&minus;through names.</p>

<h2>SOLARIS DEVICE NAMING
<a name="SOLARIS DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI device
names below the /dev directory have a form like: c5t4d3s2
where the number following &quot;c&quot; is the controller
(HBA) number, the number following &quot;t&quot; is the
target number (from the SCSI parallel interface days) and
the number following &quot;d&quot; is the LUN. Following the
&quot;s&quot; is the slice number which is related to a
partition and by convention &quot;s2&quot; is the whole
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSolaris
also has a c5t4d3p2 form where the number following the
&quot;p&quot; is the partition number apart from
&quot;p0&quot; which is the whole disk. So a whole disk may
be referred to as either c5t4d3, c5t4d3s2 or c5t4d3p0 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And these
device names are duplicated in the /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk
directories. The former is the block device name and the
latter is for &quot;raw&quot; (or char device) access which
is what sg3_utils needs. So in OpenSolaris something of the
form &rsquo;sg_inq /dev/rdsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo; should work. If
it doesn&rsquo;t work then add a &rsquo;&minus;vvv&rsquo;
option for more debug information. Trying this form
&rsquo;sg_inq /dev/dsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo; (note
&quot;rdsk&quot; changed to &quot;dsk&quot;) will result in
an &quot;inappropriate ioctl for device&quot; error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The device
names within the /dev directory are typically symbolic links
to much longer topological names in the /device directory.
In Solaris cd/dvd/bd drives seem to be treated as disks and
so are found in the /dev/rdsk directory. Tape drives appear
in the /dev/rmt directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
sgen (SCSI generic) driver which by default does not attach
to any device. See the /kernel/drv/sgen.conf file to control
what is attached. Any attached device will have a device
name of the form /dev/scsi/c5t4d3 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listing
available SCSI devices in Solaris seems to be a challenge.
&quot;Use the &rsquo;format&rsquo; command&quot; advice
works but seems a very dangerous way to list devices. [It
does prompt again before doing any damage.] &rsquo;devfsadm
&minus;Cv&rsquo; cleans out the clutter in the /dev/rdsk
directory, only leaving what is &quot;live&quot;. The
&quot;cfgadm &minus;v&quot; command looks promising.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To aid scripts
that call these utilities, the exit status is set to
indicate success (0) or failure (1 or more). Note that some
of the lower values correspond to the SCSI sense key values.
The exit status values are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a signal kills a utility
then the exit status is 128 plus the signal number. For
example if a segmentation fault occurs then a utility is
typically killed by SIGSEGV which according to &rsquo;man 7

exit status will be 139 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
error conditions reported above will be repeatable (an
example of one that is not is &quot;unit attention&quot;) so
the utility can be run again with the &rsquo;&minus;v&rsquo;

<h2>COMMON OPTIONS
<a name="COMMON OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. In the
short form an argument to an option uses zero or more spaces
as a separator (i.e. the short form does not use
&quot;=&quot; as a separator).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an option
takes a numeric argument then that argument is assumed to be
decimal unless otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading
&quot;0x&quot;, a trailing &quot;h&quot; or as noted in the
usage message).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some options
are used uniformly in most of the utilities in this package.
Those options are listed below. Note that there are some
exceptions. <b><br>
&minus;h</b>, <b>&minus;?</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output the usage message then
exit. In a few older utilities the &rsquo;&minus;h&rsquo;
option requests hexadecimal output. In these cases the
&rsquo;&minus;?&rsquo; option will output the usage message
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;H</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;hex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">for SCSI commands that yield a
non&minus;trivial response, print out that response in ASCII
hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;maxlen</b>=<i>LEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">several important SCSI commands
(e.g. INQUIRY and MODE SENSE) have response lengths that
vary depending on many factors, only some of which these
utilities take into account. The maximum response length is
typically specified in the &rsquo;allocation length&rsquo;
field of the cdb. In the absence of this option, several
utilities use a default allocation length (sometimes
recommended in the SCSI draft standards) or a &quot;double
fetch&quot; strategy. See sg_logs(8) for its description of
a &quot;double fetch&quot; strategy. These techniques are
imperfect and in the presence of faulty SCSI targets can
cause problems (e.g. some USB mass storage devices freeze if
they receive an INQUIRY allocation length other than 36).
Also use of this option disables any &quot;double
fetch&quot; strategy that may have otherwise been used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;r</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;raw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">for SCSI commands that yield a
non&minus;trivial response, output that response in binary
to stdout. If any error messages or warning are produced
they are usually sent to stderr. Some utilities that consume
data to send to the device along with the SCSI command, use
this option to provide that data or indicate that it can be
read from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the level of

<h2>NUMERIC ARGUMENTS
<a name="NUMERIC ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many utilities
have command line options that take numeric arguments. These
numeric arguments can be large values (e.g. a logical block
address (LBA) on a disk) and can be inconvenient to enter in
the default decimal representation. So various other
representations are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiplicative
suffixes are accepted. They are one, two or three letter
strings appended directly after the number to which they
apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">c C *1 <br>
w W *2 <br>
b B *512 <br>
k K KiB *1024 <br>
KB *1000 <br>
m M MiB *1048576 <br>
MB *1000000 <br>
g G GiB *(2^30) <br>
GB *(10^9) <br>
t T TiB *(2^40) <br>
TB *(10^12) <br>
p P PiB *(2^50) <br>
PB *(10^15)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example is
&quot;2k&quot; for 2048. The large tera and peta suffixes
are only available for numeric arguments that might require
64 bits to represent internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A suffix of the
form &quot;x&lt;n&gt;&quot; multiplies the leading number by
&lt;n&gt;. An example is &quot;2x33&quot; for
&quot;66&quot;. The leading number cannot be &quot;0&quot;
(zero) as that would be interpreted as a hexadecimal number
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
multiplicative suffixes are compatible with GNU&rsquo;s dd
command (since 2002) which claims compliance with SI and
with IEC 60027&minus;2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively
numerical arguments can be given in hexadecimal. There are
two syntaxes. The number can be preceded by either
&quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; as found in the C
programming language. The second hexadecimal representation
is a trailing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot; as found in
(storage) standards. When hex numbers are given, multipliers
cannot be used. For example the decimal value
&quot;256&quot; can be given as &quot;0x100&quot; or
&quot;100h&quot;.</p>

<h2>SCRIPTS, EXAMPLES and UTILS
<a name="SCRIPTS, EXAMPLES and UTILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several bash shell scripts in the &rsquo;scripts&rsquo;
subdirectory that invoke compiled utilities (e.g.
sg_readcap). The scripts start with &rsquo;scsi_&rsquo;
rather than &rsquo;sg_&rsquo;. One purpose of these scripts
is to call the same utility (e.g. sg_readcap) on multiple
disks. Most of the basic compiled utilities only allow one
device as an argument. Some distributions install these
scripts in a visible directory (e.g. /usr/src/bin). Some of
these scripts have man page entries. See the README file in
the &rsquo;scripts&rsquo; subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
example C code plus examples of complex invocations in the
&rsquo;examples&rsquo; subdirectory. There is also a README
file. The example C may be a simpler example of how to use a
SCSI pass&minus;through in Linux than the main utilities
(found in the &rsquo;src&rsquo; subdirectory). This is due
to the fewer abstraction layers (e.g. they don&rsquo;t worry
the MinGW in Windows may open a file in text rather than
binary mode).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some utilities
that the author has found useful have been placed in the
&rsquo;utils&rsquo; subdirectory.</p>
