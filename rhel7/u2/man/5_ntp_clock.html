<h2>REFERENCE CLOCK SUPPORT
<a name="REFERENCE CLOCK SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The NTP Version
4 daemon supports some three dozen different radio,
satellite and modem reference clocks plus a special
pseudo-clock used for backup or when no other clock source
is available. Detailed descriptions of individual device
drivers and options can be found in the Reference Clock
Drivers page. Additional information can be found in the
pages linked there, including the Debugging Hints for
Reference Clock Drivers and How To Write a Reference Clock
Driver pages. In addition, support for a PPS signal is
available as described in Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal
Interfacing page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference
clock will generally (though not always) be a radio timecode
receiver which is synchronized to a source of standard time
such as the services offered by the NRC in Canada and NIST
and USNO in the US. The interface between the computer and
the timecode receiver is device dependent, but is usually a
serial port. A device driver specific to each reference
clock must be selected and compiled in the distribution;
however, most common radio, satellite and modem clocks are
included by default. Note that an attempt to configure a
reference clock when the driver has not been compiled or the
hardware port has not been appropriately configured results
in a scalding remark to the system log file, but is
otherwise non hazardous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
purposes of configuration, <b>ntpd</b> treats reference
clocks in a manner analogous to normal NTP peers as much as
possible. Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically
correct but invalid IP address, in order to distinguish them
from normal NTP peers. Reference clock addresses are of the
form <b>127.127.</b><i>t.u</i>, where <b>t</b> is an integer
denoting the clock type and <b>u</b> indicates the unit
number in the range 0-3. While it may seem overkill, it is
in fact sometimes useful to configure multiple reference
clocks of the same type, in which case the unit numbers must
be unique.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>server</b> command is used to configure a reference
clock, where the <b>address</b> argument in that command is
the clock address. The <b>key</b>, <b>version</b> and
<b>ttl</b> options are not used for reference clock support.
The <b>mode</b> option is added for reference clock support,
as described below. The <b>prefer</b> option can be useful
to persuade the server to cherish a reference clock with
somewhat more enthusiasm than other reference clocks or
peers. Further information on this option can be found in
the Mitigation Rules and the <b>prefer</b> Keyword page. The
<b>minpoll</b> and <b>maxpoll</b> options have meaning only
for selected clock drivers. See the individual clock driver
document pages for additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>fudge</b> command is used to provide additional
information for individual clock drivers and normally
follows immediately after the <b>server</b> command. The
<b>address</b> argument specifies the clock address. The
<b>refid</b> and <b>stratum</b> options control can be used
to override the defaults for the device. There are two
optional device-dependent time offsets and four flags that
can be included in the <b>fudge</b> command as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The stratum
number of a reference clock is by default zero. Since the
<b>ntpd</b> daemon adds one to the stratum of each peer, a
primary server ordinarily displays an external stratum of
one. In order to provide engineered backups, it is often
useful to specify the reference clock stratum as greater
than zero. The <b>stratum</b> option is used for this
purpose. Also, in cases involving both a reference clock and
a pulse-per-second (PPS) discipline signal, it is useful to
specify the reference clock identifier as other than the
default, depending on the driver. The <b>refid</b> option is
used for this purpose. Except where noted, these options
apply to all clock drivers.</p>

<h2>REFERENCE CLOCK COMMANDS
<a name="REFERENCE CLOCK COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>server
127.127.</b><i>t.u</i> <b>[prefer] [mode</b> <i>int</i><b>]
[minpoll</b> <i>int</i><b>] [maxpoll</b>
<i>int</i><b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command can be used to
configure reference clocks in special ways. The options are
interpreted as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="23%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>prefer</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="65%">


<p>Marks the reference clock as preferred. All other things
being equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization
among a set of correctly operating hosts. See the Mitigation
Rules and the <b>prefer</b> Keyword page for further
information.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>mode</b> <i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies a mode number which
is interpreted in a device-specific fashion. For instance,
it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS driver and a
device subtype in the <b>parse</b> drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>minpoll</b> <i>int</i>
<b><br>
maxpoll</b> <i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">These options specify the
minimum and maximum polling interval for reference clock
messages in seconds, interpreted as dual logarithms (2 ^ x).
For most directly connected reference clocks, both
<b>minpoll</b> and <b>maxpoll</b> default to 6 (2^16 = 64
s). For modem reference clocks, <b>minpoll</b> defaults to
10 (2^10 = 1024 s = 17.1 m) and <b>maxpoll</b> defaults to
14 (2^14 = 16384 s = 4.5 h). The allowable range is 4 (16 s)
to 17 (36.4 h) inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fudge 127.127.</b><i>t.u</i>
<b>[time1</b> <i>sec</i><b>] [time2</b> <i>sec</i><b>]
[stratum</b> <i>int</i><b>] [refid</b> <i>string</i><b>]
<br>
[flag1 0|1] [flag2 0|1] [flag3 0|1] [flag4 0|1]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This command can be used to
configure reference clocks in special ways. It must
immediately follow the <b>server</b> command which
configures the driver. Note that the same capability is
possible at run time using the <b>ntpdc</b> program. The
options are interpreted as follows: <b><br>
time1</b> <i>sec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies a constant to be
added to the time offset produced by the driver, a
fixed-point decimal number in seconds. This is used as a
calibration constant to adjust the nominal time offset of a
particular clock to agree with an external standard, such as
a precision PPS signal. It also provides a way to correct a
systematic error or bias due to serial port or operating
system latencies, different cable lengths or receiver
internal delay. The specified offset is in addition to the
propagation delay provided by other means, such as internal
DIPswitches. Where a calibration for an individual system
and driver is available, an approximate correction is noted
in the driver documentation pages. Note: in order to
facilitate calibration when more than one radio clock or PPS
signal is supported, a special calibration feature is
available. It takes the form of an argument to the
<b>enable</b> command described in the Miscellaneous Options
page and operates as described in the Reference Clock
Drivers page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>time2</b> <i>secs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies a fixed-point decimal
number in seconds, which is interpreted in a
driver-dependent way. See the descriptions of specific
drivers in the reference clock drivers page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>stratum</b> <i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies the stratum number
assigned to the driver, an integer between 0 and 15. This
number overrides the default stratum number ordinarily
assigned by the driver itself, usually zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>refid</b> <i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">Specifies an ASCII string of
from one to four characters which defines the reference
identifier used by the driver. This string overrides the
default identifier ordinarily assigned by the driver
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>flag1 flag2 flag3
flag4</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:35%;">These four flags are used for
customizing the clock driver. The interpretation of these
values, and whether they are used at all, is a function of
the particular clock driver. However, by convention
<b>flag4</b> is used to enable recording monitoring data to
the <b>clockstats</b> file configured with the
<b>filegen</b> command. Further information on the
<b>filegen</b> command can be found in the Monitoring
Options page.</p>
