</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>urb</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">pointer to the urb describing
the request</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>mem_flags</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the type of memory to allocate,
see <b>kmalloc</b> for a list of valid options for this.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This submits a
transfer request, and transfers control of the URB
describing that request to the USB subsystem. Request
completion will be indicated later, asynchronously, by
calling the completion handler. The three types of
completion are success, error, and unlink (a
software&minus;induced fault, also called &ldquo;request
cancellation&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">URBs may be
submitted in interrupt context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The caller must
have correctly initialized the URB before submitting it.
Functions such as <b>usb_fill_bulk_urb</b> and
<b>usb_fill_control_urb</b> are available to ensure that
most fields are correctly initialized, for the particular
kind of transfer, although they will not initialize any
transfer flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
submission is successful, the <b>complete</b> callback from
the URB will be called exactly once, when the USB core and
Host Controller Driver (HCD) are finished with the URB. When
the completion function is called, control of the URB is
returned to the device driver which issued the request. The
completion handler may then immediately free or reuse that
URB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With few
exceptions, USB device drivers should never access URB
fields provided by usbcore or the HCD until its
<b>complete</b> is called. The exceptions relate to periodic
transfer scheduling. For both interrupt and isochronous
urbs, as part of successful URB submission
urb&minus;&gt;interval is modified to reflect the actual
transfer period used (normally some power of two units). And
for isochronous urbs, urb&minus;&gt;start_frame is modified
to reflect when the URB's transfers were scheduled to
start.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
isochronous transfer scheduling policies will work, but most
host controller drivers should easily handle ISO queues
going from now until 10&minus;200 msec into the future.
Drivers should try to keep at least one or two msec of data
in the queue; many controllers require that new transfers
start at least 1 msec in the future when they are added. If
the driver is unable to keep up and the queue empties out,
the behavior for new submissions is governed by the
URB_ISO_ASAP flag. If the flag is set, or if the queue is
idle, then the URB is always assigned to the first available
(and not yet expired) slot in the endpoint's schedule. If
the flag is not set and the queue is active then the URB is
always assigned to the next slot in the schedule following
the end of the endpoint's previous URB, even if that slot is
in the past. When a packet is assigned in this way to a slot
that has already expired, the packet is not transmitted and
the corresponding usb_iso_packet_descriptor's status field
will return &minus;EXDEV. If this would happen to all the
packets in the URB, submission fails with a &minus;EXDEV
error code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For control
endpoints, the synchronous <b>usb_control_msg</b> call is
often used (in non&minus;interrupt context) instead of this
call. That is often used through convenience wrappers, for
the requests that are standardized in the USB 2.0
specification. For bulk endpoints, a synchronous
<b>usb_bulk_msg</b> call is available.</p>

<h2>RETURN
<a name="RETURN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0 on successful
submissions. A negative error number otherwise.</p>

<h2>REQUEST QUEUING
<a name="REQUEST QUEUING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">URBs may be
submitted to endpoints before previous ones complete, to
minimize the impact of interrupt latencies and system
overhead on data throughput. With that queuing policy, an
endpoint's queue would never be empty. This is required for
continuous isochronous data streams, and may also be
required for some kinds of interrupt transfers. Such queuing
also maximizes bandwidth utilization by letting USB
controllers start work on later requests before driver
software has finished the completion processing for earlier
(successful) requests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Linux
2.6, all USB endpoint transfer queues support depths greater
than one. This was previously a HCD&minus;specific behavior,
except for ISO transfers. Non&minus;isochronous endpoint
queues are inactive during cleanup after faults (transfer
errors or cancellation).</p>

<h2>RESERVED BANDWIDTH TRANSFERS
<a name="RESERVED BANDWIDTH TRANSFERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Periodic
transfers (interrupt or isochronous) are performed
repeatedly, using the interval specified in the urb.
Submitting the first urb to the endpoint reserves the
bandwidth necessary to make those transfers. If the USB
subsystem can't allocate sufficient bandwidth to perform the
periodic request, submitting such a periodic request should
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For devices
under xHCI, the bandwidth is reserved at configuration time,
or when the alt setting is selected. If there is not enough
bus bandwidth, the configuration/alt setting request will
fail. Therefore, submissions to periodic endpoints on
devices under xHCI should never fail due to bandwidth
constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Device drivers
must explicitly request that repetition, by ensuring that
some URB is always on the endpoint's queue (except possibly
for short periods during completion callbacks). When there
is no longer an urb queued, the endpoint's bandwidth
reservation is canceled. This means drivers can use their
completion handlers to ensure they keep bandwidth they need,
by reinitializing and resubmitting the just&minus;completed
urb until the driver longer needs that periodic
bandwidth.</p>

<h2>MEMORY FLAGS
<a name="MEMORY FLAGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The general
rules for how to decide which mem_flags to use are the same
as for kmalloc. There are four different possible values;
GFP_KERNEL, GFP_NOFS, GFP_NOIO and GFP_ATOMIC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GFP_NOFS is not
ever used, as it has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GFP_ATOMIC is
used when (a) you are inside a completion handler, an
interrupt, bottom half, tasklet or timer, or (b) you are
holding a spinlock or rwlock (does not apply to semaphores),
or (c) current&minus;&gt;state != TASK_RUNNING, this is the
case only after you've changed it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GFP_NOIO is
used in the block io path and error handling of storage
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
situations use GFP_KERNEL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some more
specific rules for mem_flags can be inferred, such as (1)
start_xmit, timeout, and receive methods of network drivers
must use GFP_ATOMIC (they are called with a spinlock held);
(2) queuecommand methods of scsi drivers must use GFP_ATOMIC
(also called with a spinlock held); (3) If you use a kernel
thread with a network driver you must use GFP_NOIO, unless
(b) or (c) apply; (4) after you have done a <b>down</b> you
can use GFP_KERNEL, unless (b) or (c) apply or your are in a
storage driver's block io path; (5) USB probe and disconnect
can use GFP_KERNEL unless (b) or (c) apply; and (6) changing
firmware on a running storage or net device uses GFP_NOIO,
unless b) or c) apply</p>
