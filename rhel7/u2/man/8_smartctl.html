<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[This man page
is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools. It does
not contain info specific to other platforms.]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl</b>
controls the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology (SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and
SCSI/SAS hard drives and solid-state drives. The purpose of
SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive and
predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of
drive self-tests. <b>smartctl</b> also supports some
features not related to SMART. This version of
<b>smartctl</b> is compatible with ACS-2, ATA8-ACS,
ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards (see <b>REFERENCES</b>
below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl</b>
also provides support for polling TapeAlert messages from
SCSI tape drives and changers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user must
specify the device to be controlled or interrogated as the
final argument to <b>smartctl</b>. The command set used by
the device is often derived from the device path but may
need help with the &acute;&minus;d&acute; option (for more
information see the section on &quot;ATA, SCSI command sets
and SAT&quot; below). Device paths are as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<p><b>LINUX</b>:</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>Use the forms <b>&quot;/dev/hd[a&minus;t]&quot;</b> for
IDE/ATA devices, and <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a&minus;z]&quot;</b>
for SCSI devices. For SCSI Tape Drives and Changers with
TapeAlert support use the devices
<b>&quot;/dev/nst*&quot;</b> and
<b>&quot;/dev/sg*&quot;</b>. For SATA disks accessed with
libata, use <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a&minus;z]&quot;</b> and append
<b>&quot;&minus;d ata&quot;</b>. For disks behind 3ware
controllers you may need
<b>&quot;/dev/sd[a&minus;z]&quot;</b> or
<b>&quot;/dev/twe[0&minus;9]&quot;</b>,
<b>&quot;/dev/twa[0&minus;9]&quot;</b> or
<b>&quot;/dev/twl[0&minus;9]&quot;</b>: see details below.
For disks behind HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may
need <b>&quot;/dev/sd[a&minus;z]&quot;</b>. For disks behind
Areca SATA RAID controllers, you need
<b>&quot;/dev/sg[2&minus;9]&quot;</b> (note that
smartmontools interacts with the Areca controllers via a
SCSI generic device which is different than the SCSI device
used for reading and writing data)! For HP Smart Array RAID
controllers, there are three currently supported drivers:
cciss, hpsa, and hpahcisr. For disks accessed via the cciss
driver the device nodes are of the form
<b>&quot;/dev/cciss/c[0&minus;9]d0&quot;</b>. For disks
accessed via the hpahcisr and hpsa drivers, the device nodes
you need are <b>&quot;/dev/sg[0&minus;9]*&quot;</b>.
(&quot;lsscsi &minus;g&quot; is helpful in determining which
scsi generic device node corresponds to which device.) Use
the nodes corresponding to the RAID controllers, not the
nodes corresponding to logical drives. See the
<b>&minus;d</b> option below, as well.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if
&acute;&minus;&acute; is specified as the device path,
<b>smartctl</b> reads and interprets it&rsquo;s own debug
output from standard input. See &acute;&minus;r
ataioctl&acute; below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Based on the
device path, <b>smartctl</b> will guess the device type (ATA
or SCSI). If necessary, the &acute;&minus;d&acute; option
can be used to override this guess</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
printed output of <b>smartctl</b> displays most numerical
values in base 10 (decimal), but some values are displayed
in base 16 (hexadecimal). To distinguish them, the base 16
values are always displayed with a leading
<b>&quot;0x&quot;</b>, for example: &quot;0xff&quot;. This
man page follows the same convention.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options are
grouped below into several categories. <b>smartctl</b> will
execute the corresponding commands in the order:
INFORMATION, ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.
<b><br>
SHOW INFORMATION OPTIONS: <br>
&minus;h, &minus;&minus;help, &minus;&minus;usage</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints a usage message to
STDOUT and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;V,
&minus;&minus;version, &minus;&minus;copyright,
&minus;&minus;license</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints version, copyright,
license, home page and SVN revision information for your
copy of <b>smartctl</b> to STDOUT and then exits. Please
include this information if you are reporting bugs or
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;info</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints the device model number,
serial number, firmware version, and ATA Standard
version/revision information. Says if the device supports
SMART, and if so, whether SMART support is currently enabled
or disabled. If the device supports Logical Block Address
mode (LBA mode) print current user drive capacity in bytes.
(If drive is has a user protected area reserved, or is
&quot;clipped&quot;, this may be smaller than the potential
maximum drive capacity.) Indicates if the drive is in the
smartmontools database (see &acute;&minus;v&acute; options
below). If so, the drive model family may also be printed.
If &acute;&minus;n&acute; (see below) is specified, the
power mode of the drive is printed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;identify[=[w][nvb]]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">[ATA only] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL
SMARTCTL FEATURE] Prints an annotated table of the IDENTIFY
DEVICE data. By default, only valid words (words not equal
to 0x0000 or 0xffff) and nonzero bits and bit fields are
printed. This can be changed by the optional argument which
consists of one or two characters from the set
&acute;wnvb&acute;. The character &acute;w&acute; enables
printing of all 256 words. The character &acute;n&acute;
suppresses printing of bits, &acute;v&acute; enables
printing of all bits from valid words, &acute;b&acute;
enables printing of all bits. For example
&acute;&minus;&minus;identify=n&acute; (valid words, no
bits) produces the shortest output and
&acute;&minus;&minus;identify=wb&acute; (all words, all
bits) produces the longest output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;a,
&minus;&minus;all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints all SMART information
about the disk, or TapeAlert information about the tape
drive or changer. For ATA devices this is equivalent to <br>
&acute;&minus;H &minus;i &minus;c &minus;A &minus;l error
&minus;l selftest &minus;l selective&acute; <br>
and for SCSI, this is equivalent to <br>
&acute;&minus;H &minus;i &minus;A &minus;l error &minus;l
selftest&acute;. <br>
Note that for ATA disks this does <b>not</b> enable the
non-SMART options and the SMART options which require
support for 48-bit ATA commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x,
&minus;&minus;xall</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints all SMART and non-SMART
information about the device. For ATA devices this is

<p>Scans for devices and prints each device name, device
type and protocol ([ATA] or [SCSI]) info. May be used in
conjunction with &acute;&minus;d TYPE&acute; to restrict the
scan to a specific TYPE. See also info about platform
specific device scan and the <b>DEVICESCAN</b> directive on
<b>smartd</b>(8) man page.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;scan&minus;open</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as &minus;&minus;scan, but
also tries to open each device before printing device info.
The device open may change the device type due to
autodetection (see also &acute;&minus;d test&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option can
be used to create a draft <b>smartd.conf</b> file. All
options after &acute;&minus;&minus;&acute; are appended to
each output line. For example: <br>
smartctl &minus;&minus;scan&minus;open &minus;&minus;
&minus;a &minus;W 4,45,50 &minus;m admin@work &gt;
smartd.conf</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;g NAME,
&minus;&minus;get=NAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get non-SMART device settings.
See &acute;&minus;s, &minus;&minus;set&acute; below for
further info.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RUN-TIME BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:
<br>
&minus;q TYPE, &minus;&minus;quietmode=TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that <b>smartctl</b>
should run in one of the two quiet modes described here. The
valid arguments to this option are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>errorsonly</i>
&minus; only print: For the &acute;&minus;l error&acute;
option, if nonzero, the number of errors recorded in the
SMART error log and the power-on time when they occurred;
For the &acute;&minus;l selftest&acute; option, errors
recorded in the device self-test log; For the
&acute;&minus;H&acute; option, SMART &quot;disk
failing&quot; status or device Attributes (pre-failure or
usage) which failed either now or in the past; For the
&acute;&minus;A&acute; option, device Attributes
(pre-failure or usage) which failed either now or in the
past.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>silent</i>
&minus; print no output. The only way to learn about what
was found is to use the exit status of <b>smartctl</b> (see
RETURN VALUES below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>noserial</i>
&minus; Do not print the serial number of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d TYPE,
&minus;&minus;device=TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the type of the
device. The valid arguments to this option are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>auto</i>
&minus; attempt to guess the device type from the device
name or from controller type info provided by the operating
system or from a matching USB ID entry in the drive
database. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>test</i>
&minus; prints the guessed type, then opens the device and
prints the (possibly changed) TYPE name and then exists
without performing any further commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ata</i>
&minus; the device type is ATA. This prevents
<b>smartctl</b> from issuing SCSI commands to an ATA
device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>scsi</i>
&minus; the device type is SCSI. This prevents
<b>smartctl</b> from issuing ATA commands to a SCSI
device.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sat[,auto][,N]</i>
&minus; the device type is SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT).
This is for ATA disks that have a SCSI to ATA Translation
(SAT) Layer (SATL) between the disk and the operating
system. SAT defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI commands, one
12 bytes long and the other 16 bytes long. The default is
the 16 byte variant which can be overridden with either
&acute;&minus;d sat,12&acute; or &acute;&minus;d
sat,16&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
&acute;&minus;d sat,auto&acute; is specified, device type
SAT (for ATA/SATA disks) is only used if the SCSI INQUIRY
data reports a SATL (VENDOR: &quot;ATA &quot;). Otherwise
device type SCSI (for SCSI/SAS disks) is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>usbcypress</i>
&minus; this device type is for ATA disks that are behind a
Cypress USB to PATA bridge. This will use the ATACB
proprietary scsi pass through command. The default SCSI
operation code is 0x24, but although it can be overridden
with &acute;&minus;d usbcypress,0xN&acute;, where N is the
scsi operation code, you&rsquo;re running the risk of damage
to the device or filesystems on it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>usbjmicron[,p][,x][,PORT]</i>
&minus; this device type is for SATA disks that are behind a
JMicron USB to PATA/SATA bridge. The 48-bit ATA commands
(required e.g. for &acute;&minus;l xerror&acute;, see below)
do not work with all of these bridges and are therefore
disabled by default. These commands can be enabled by
&acute;&minus;d usbjmicron,x&acute;. If two disks are
connected to a bridge with two ports, an error message is
printed if no PORT is specified. The port can be specified
by &acute;&minus;d usbjmicron[,x],PORT&acute; where PORT is
0 (master) or 1 (slave). This is not necessary if the device
uses a port multiplier to connect multiple disks to one
port. The disks appear under separate /dev/ice names then.
CAUTION: Specifying &acute;,x&acute; for a device which does
not support it results in I/O errors and may disconnect the
drive. The same applies if the specified PORT does not exist
or is not connected to a disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">[NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] The Prolific PL2507/3507 USB
bridges with older firmware support a pass-through command
similar to JMicron and work with &acute;&minus;d
usbjmicron,0&acute;. Newer Prolific firmware requires a
modified command which can be selected by &acute;&minus;d
usbjmicron,p&acute;. Note that this does not yet support the
SMART status command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>usbsunplus</i>
&minus; this device type is for SATA disks that are behind a
SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>marvell</i>
&minus; [Linux only] interact with SATA disks behind Marvell
chip-set controllers (using the Marvell rather than libata
driver).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>megaraid,N</i>
&minus; [Linux only] the device consists of one or more
SCSI/SAS disks connected to a MegaRAID controller. The
non-negative integer N (in the range of 0 to 127 inclusive)
denotes which disk on the controller is monitored. Use
syntax such as: <b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d megaraid,2 /dev/sda <br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb <br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d megaraid,0 /dev/bus/0</b> <br>
This interface will also work for Dell PERC controllers. It
is possible to set RAID device name as /dev/bus/N, where N
is a SCSI bus number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
entry in /proc/devices must exist: <br>
For PERC2/3/4 controllers: <b>megadevN</b> <br>
For PERC5/6 controllers: <b>megaraid_sas_ioctlN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>3ware,N</i>
&minus; [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one
or more ATA disks connected to a 3ware RAID controller. The
non-negative integer N (in the range from 0 to 127
inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is
monitored. Use syntax such as: <b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d 3ware,2 /dev/sda</b> [Linux only]
<b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0 <br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0 <br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d 3ware,1 /dev/twl0</b> [Linux
only] <b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d 3ware,1 /dev/tws0</b> [FreeBSD
only] <br>
The first two forms, which refer to devices /dev/sda&minus;z
and /dev/twe0&minus;15, may be used with 3ware series 6000,
7000, and 8000 series controllers that use the 3x-xxxx
driver. <b>Note that the /dev/sda&minus;z form is
deprecated</b> starting with the Linux 2.6 kernel series and
may not be supported by the Linux kernel in the near future.
The final form, which refers to devices /dev/twa0&minus;15,
must be used with 3ware 9000 series controllers, which use
the 3w&minus;9xxx driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The devices
/dev/twl0&minus;15 [Linux] or /dev/tws0&minus;15 [FreeBSD]
must be used with the 3ware/LSI 9750 series controllers
which use the 3w-sas driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
the special character device nodes /dev/tw[ls]?, /dev/twa?
and /dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the incorrect
major or minor numbers, smartctl will recreate them on the
fly. Typically /dev/twa0 refers to the first 9000-series
controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second 9000 series
controller, and so on. The /dev/twl0 devices refers to the
first 9750 series controller, /dev/twl1 resfers to the
second 9750 series controller, and so on. Likewise /dev/twe0
refers to the first 6/7/8000-series controller, /dev/twe1
refers to the second 6/7/8000 series controller, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
the 6/7/8000 controllers, <b>any</b> of the physical disks
can be queried or examined using <b>any</b> of the
3ware&rsquo;s SCSI logical device /dev/sd? entries. Thus, if
logical device /dev/sda is made up of two physical disks
(3ware ports zero and one) and logical device /dev/sdb is
made up of two other physical disks (3ware ports two and
three) then you can examine the SMART data on <b>any</b> of
the four physical disks using <b>either</b> SCSI device
/dev/sda <b>or</b> /dev/sdb. If you need to know which
logical SCSI device a particular physical disk (3ware port)
is associated with, use the dmesg or SYSLOG output to show
which SCSI ID corresponds to a particular 3ware unit, and
then use the 3ware CLI or 3dm tool to determine which ports
(physical disks) correspond to particular 3ware units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
N corresponds to a port that does <b>not</b> exist on the
3ware controller, or to a port that does not physically have
a disk attached to it, the behavior of <b>smartctl</b>
depends upon the specific controller model, firmware, Linux
kernel and platform. In some cases you will get a warning
message that the device does not exist. In other cases you
will be presented with &acute;void&acute; data for a
non-existent device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
the /dev/sd? addressing form is used, then older 3w-xxxx
drivers do not pass the &quot;Enable Autosave&quot;
(&acute;<b>&minus;S on</b>&acute;) and &quot;Enable
Automatic Offline&quot; (&acute;<b>&minus;o on</b>&acute;)
commands to the disk, and produce these types of harmless
syslog error messages instead: &quot;<b>3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl():
Passthru size (123392) too big</b>&quot;. This can be fixed
by upgrading to version 1.02.00.037 or later of the 3w-xxxx
driver, or by applying a patch to older versions.
Alternatively, use the character device /dev/twe0&minus;15
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The selective
self-test functions (&acute;&minus;t
select,A&minus;B&acute;) are only supported using the
character device interface /dev/twl0&minus;15,
/dev/tws0&minus;15, /dev/twa0&minus;15 and
/dev/twe0&minus;15. The necessary WRITE LOG commands can not
be passed through the SCSI interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>areca,N</i>
&minus; [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] the device
consists of one or more SATA disks connected to an Areca
SATA RAID controller. The positive integer N (in the range
from 1 to 24 inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller
is monitored. On Linux use syntax such as: <b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d areca,2 /dev/sg2 <br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d areca,3 /dev/sg3</b> <br>
The first line above addresses the second disk on the first
Areca RAID controller. The second line addresses the third
disk on the second Areca RAID controller. To help identify
the correct device on Linux, use the command: <b><br>
cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices</b> <br>
to show the SCSI generic devices (one per line, starting
with /dev/sg0). The correct SCSI generic devices to address
for smartmontools are the ones with the type field equal to
3. If the incorrect device is addressed, please read the
warning/error messages carefully. They should provide hints
about what devices to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Important: the
Areca controller must have firmware version 1.46 or later.
Lower-numbered firmware versions will give (harmless) SCSI
error messages and no SMART information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>areca,N/E</i>
&minus; [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] [NEW
EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] the device consists of one or
more SATA or SAS disks connected to an Areca SAS RAID
controller. The integer N (range 1 to 128) denotes the
channel (slot) and E (range 1 to 8) denotes the enclosure.
Important: This requires Areca SAS controller firmware
version 1.51 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>cciss,N</i>
&minus; [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one
or more SCSI/SAS or SATA disks connected to a cciss RAID
controller. The non-negative integer N (in the range from 0
to 15 inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is
monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To look at
disks behind HP Smart Array controllers, use syntax such as:
<b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0</b>
(cciss driver under Linux) <b><br>
smartctl &minus;a &minus;d cciss,0 /dev/sg2</b> (hpsa or

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>hpt,L/M/N</i>
&minus; [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one
or more ATA disks connected to a HighPoint RocketRAID
controller. The integer L is the controller id, the integer
M is the channel number, and the integer N is the PMPort
number if it is available. The allowed values of L are from

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
SMART automatic offline test command is listed as
&quot;Obsolete&quot; in every version of the ATA and
ATA/ATAPI Specifications. It was originally part of the
SFF-8035i Revision 2.0 specification, but was never part of
any ATA specification. However it is implemented and used by
many vendors. [Good documentation can be found in
IBM&acute;s Official Published Disk Specifications. For
example the IBM Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive
Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22 April 2002, Publication #
1541, Document S07N-7715-02) page 164. You can also read the
SFF-8035i Specification -- see REFERENCES below.] You can
tell if automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if
this command enables and disables it, as indicated by the
&acute;Auto Offline Data Collection&acute; part of the SMART
capabilities report (displayed with
&acute;&minus;c&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">SMART provides
<b>three</b> basic categories of testing. The <b>first</b>
category, called &quot;online&quot; testing, has no effect
on the performance of the device. It is turned on by the
&acute;&minus;s on&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>second</b> category of testing is called
&quot;offline&quot; testing. This type of test can, in
principle, degrade the device performance. The
&acute;&minus;o on&acute; option causes this offline testing
to be carried out, automatically, on a regular scheduled
basis. Normally, the disk will suspend offline testing while
disk accesses are taking place, and then automatically
resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so in
practice it has little effect. Note that a one-time offline
test can also be carried out immediately upon receipt of a
user command. See the &acute;&minus;t offline&acute; option
below, which causes a one-time offline test to be carried
out immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The choice
(made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors) of the
word <i>testing</i> for these first two categories is
unfortunate, and often leads to confusion. In fact these
first two categories of online and offline testing could
have been more accurately described as online and offline
<b>data collection</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The results of
this automatic or immediate offline testing (data
collection) are reflected in the values of the SMART
Attributes. Thus, if problems or errors are detected, the
values of these Attributes will go below their failure
thresholds; some types of errors may also appear in the
SMART error log. These are visible with the
&acute;&minus;A&acute; and &acute;&minus;l error&acute;
options respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Some SMART
attribute values are updated only during off-line data
collection activities; the rest are updated during normal
operation of the device or during both normal operation and
off-line testing. The Attribute value table produced by the
&acute;&minus;A&acute; option indicates this in the UPDATED
column. Attributes of the first type are labeled
&quot;Offline&quot; and Attributes of the second type are
labeled &quot;Always&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>third</b> category of testing (and the <i>only</i>
category for which the word &acute;testing&acute; is really
an appropriate choice) is &quot;self&quot; testing. This
third type of test is only performed (immediately) when a
command to run it is issued. The &acute;&minus;t&acute; and
&acute;&minus;X&acute; options can be used to carry out and
abort such self-tests; please see below for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Any errors
detected in the self testing will be shown in the SMART
self-test log, which can be examined using the
&acute;&minus;l selftest&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b> in
this manual page, the word <b>&quot;Test&quot;</b> is used
in connection with the second category just described, e.g.
for the &quot;offline&quot; testing. The words
<b>&quot;Self-test&quot;</b> are used in connection with the

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A,
&minus;&minus;attributes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">[ATA] Prints only the vendor
specific SMART Attributes. The Attributes are numbered from
1 to 253 and have specific names and ID numbers. For example
Attribute 12 is &quot;power cycle count&quot;: how many
times has the disk been powered up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute
has a &quot;Raw&quot; value, printed under the heading
&quot;RAW_VALUE&quot;, and a &quot;Normalized&quot; value
printed under the heading &quot;VALUE&quot;. [Note:
<b>smartctl</b> prints these values in base-10.] In the
example just given, the &quot;Raw Value&quot; for Attribute
12 would be the actual number of times that the disk has
been power-cycled, for example 365 if the disk has been
turned on once per day for exactly one year. Each vendor
uses their own algorithm to convert this &quot;Raw&quot;
value to a &quot;Normalized&quot; value in the range from 1
to 254. Please keep in mind that <b>smartctl</b> only
reports the different Attribute types, values, and
thresholds as read from the device. It does <b>not</b> carry
out the conversion between &quot;Raw&quot; and
&quot;Normalized&quot; values: this is done by the
disk&acute;s firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The conversion
from Raw value to a quantity with physical units is not
specified by the SMART standard. In most cases, the values
printed by <b>smartctl</b> are sensible. For example the
temperature Attribute generally has its raw value equal to
the temperature in Celsius. However in some cases vendors
use unusual conventions. For example the Hitachi disk on my
laptop reports its power-on hours in minutes, not hours.
Some IBM disks track three temperatures rather than one, in
their raw values. And so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute
also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255) which
is printed under the heading &quot;THRESH&quot;. If the
Normalized value is <b>less than or equal to</b> the
Threshold value, then the Attribute is said to have failed.
If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute, then disk
failure is imminent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each Attribute
also has a &quot;Worst&quot; value shown under the heading
&quot;WORST&quot;. This is the smallest (closest to failure)
value that the disk has recorded at any time during its
lifetime when SMART was enabled. [Note however that some
vendors firmware may actually <b>increase</b> the
&quot;Worst&quot; value for some &quot;rate-type&quot;
Attributes.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The Attribute
table printed out by <b>smartctl</b> also shows the
&quot;TYPE&quot; of the Attribute. Attributes are one of two
possible types: Pre-failure or Old age. Pre-failure
Attributes are ones which, if less than or equal to their
threshold values, indicate pending disk failure. Old age, or
usage Attributes, are ones which indicate end-of-product
life from old-age or normal aging and wearout, if the
Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.
<b>Please note</b>: the fact that an Attribute is of type
&rsquo;Pre-fail&rsquo; does <b>not</b> mean that your disk
is about to fail! It only has this meaning if the
Attribute&acute;s current Normalized value is less than or
equal to the threshold value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
Attribute&acute;s current Normalized value is less than or
equal to the threshold value, then the
&quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column will display
&quot;FAILING_NOW&quot;. If not, but the worst recorded
value is less than or equal to the threshold value, then
this column will display &quot;In_the_past&quot;. If the
&quot;WHEN_FAILED&quot; column has no entry (indicated by a
dash: &acute;&minus;&acute;) then this Attribute is OK now
(not failing) and has also never failed in the past.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The table
column labeled &quot;UPDATED&quot; shows if the SMART
Attribute values are updated during both normal operation
and off-line testing, or only during offline testing. The
former are labeled &quot;Always&quot; and the latter are
labeled &quot;Offline&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">So to
summarize: the Raw Attribute values are the ones that might
have a real physical interpretation, such as
&quot;Temperature Celsius&quot;, &quot;Hours&quot;, or
&quot;Start-Stop Cycles&quot;. Each manufacturer converts
these, using their detailed knowledge of the disk&acute;s
operations and failure modes, to Normalized Attribute values
in the range 1&minus;254. The current and worst (lowest
measured) of these Normalized Attribute values are stored on
the disk, along with a Threshold value that the manufacturer
has determined will indicate that the disk is going to fail,
or that it has exceeded its design age or aging limit.
<b>smartctl</b> does <b>not</b> calculate any of the
Attribute values, thresholds, or types, it merely reports
them from the SMART data on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of these
Attribute fields has been made entirely vendor-specific.
However most newer ATA/SATA disks seem to respect their
meaning, so we have retained the option of printing the
Attribute values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Solid-state
drives use different meanings for some of the attributes. In
this case the attribute name printed by smartctl is
incorrect unless the drive is already in the smartmontools
drive database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>error</i>
&minus; [ATA] prints the Summary SMART error log. SMART
disks maintain a log of the most recent five non-trivial
errors. For each of these errors, the disk power-on lifetime
at which the error occurred is recorded, as is the device
status (idle, standby, etc) at the time of the error. For
some common types of errors, the Error Register (ER) and
Status Register (SR) values are decoded and printed as text.
The meanings of these are: <b><br>
ABRT</b>: Command <b>AB</b>o<b>RT</b>ed <b><br>
AMNF</b>: <b>A</b>ddress <b>M</b>ark <b>N</b>ot <b>F</b>ound
<b><br>

WP</b>: Media is <b>W</b>rite <b>P</b>rotected <br>
In addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the
error are listed, along with a timestamp measured from the
start of the corresponding power cycle. This is displayed in
the form Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is the number of days, HH
is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds and msec is
milliseconds. [Note: this time stamp wraps after 2^32
milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and 47.296
seconds.] The key ATA disk registers are also recorded in
the log. The final column of the error log is a text-string
description of the ATA command defined by the Command
Register (CR) and Feature Register (FR) values. Commands
that are obsolete in the most current spec are listed like
this: <b>READ LONG (w/ retry) [OBS-4]</b>, indicating that
the command became obsolete with or in the ATA-4
specification. Similarly, the notation
<b>[RET&minus;</b><i>N</i><b>]</b> is used to indicate that
a command was retired in the ATA-<i>N</i> specification.
Some commands are not defined in any version of the ATA
specification but are in common use nonetheless; these are
marked <b>[NS]</b>, meaning non-standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The ATA
Specification (ATA-5 Revision 1c, Section 8.41.6.8.2) says:
<b>&quot;Error log structures shall include UNC errors, IDNF
errors for which the address requested was valid, servo
errors, write fault errors, etc. Error log data structures
shall not include errors attributed to the receipt of faulty
commands such as command codes not implemented by the device
or requests with invalid parameters or invalid
addresses.&quot;</b> The definitions of these terms are:
<b><br>
UNC</b> (<b>UNC</b>orrectable): data is uncorrectable. This
refers to data which has been read from the disk, but for
which the Error Checking and Correction (ECC) codes are
inconsistent. In effect, this means that the data can not be
read. <b><br>
IDNF</b> (<b>ID N</b>ot <b>F</b>ound): user-accessible
address could not be found. For READ LOG type commands,
<b>IDNF</b> can also indicate that a device data log
structure checksum was incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
that caused the error was a READ or WRITE command, then the
Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the error occurred will
be printed in base 10 and base 16. The LBA is a linear
address, which counts 512-byte sectors on the disk, starting
from zero. (Because of the limitations of the SMART error
log, if the LBA is greater than 0xfffffff, then either no
error log entry will be made, or the error log entry will
have an incorrect LBA. This may happen for drives with a
capacity greater than 128 GiB or 137 GB.) On Linux systems
the smartmontools web page has instructions about how to
convert the LBA address to the name of the disk file
containing the erroneous disk sector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that some manufacturers <b>ignore</b> the ATA
specifications, and make entries in the error log if the
device receives a command which is not implemented or is not
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>error</i>
&minus; [SCSI] prints the error counter log pages for reads,

an element other than zero.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xerror[,NUM][,error]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] prints the Extended Comprehensive SMART
error log (General Purpose Log address 0x03). Unlike the
Summary SMART error log (see &acute;&minus;l error&acute;
above), it provides sufficient space to log the contents of
the 48-bit LBA register set introduced with ATA-6. It also
supports logs with more than one sector. Each sector holds
up to 4 log entries. The actual number of log sectors is
vendor specific, typical values for HDD are 2 (Samsung), 5
(Seagate) or 6 (WD).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Only the 8 most

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>selftest</i>
&minus; [ATA] prints the SMART self-test log. The disk
maintains a self-test log showing the results of the self
tests, which can be run using the &acute;&minus;t&acute;
option described below. For each of the most recent
twenty-one self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short
or extended, off-line or captive) and the final status of
the test. If the test did not complete successfully, then
the percentage of the test remaining is shown. The time at
which the test took place, measured in hours of disk
lifetime, is also printed. [Note: this time stamp wraps
after 2^16 hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5
years.] If any errors were detected, the Logical Block
Address (LBA) of the first error is printed in decimal
notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools web page has
instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the
name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>selftest</i>
&minus; [SCSI] the self-test log for a SCSI device has a
slightly different format than for an ATA device. For each
of the most recent twenty self-tests, it shows the type of
test and the status (final or in progress) of the test. SCSI
standards use the terms &quot;foreground&quot; and
&quot;background&quot; (rather than ATA&acute;s
corresponding &quot;captive&quot; and &quot;off-line&quot;)
and &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; (rather than
ATA&acute;s corresponding &quot;short&quot; and
&quot;extended&quot;) to describe the type of the test. The
printed segment number is only relevant when a test fails in
the third or later test segment. It identifies the test that
failed and consists of either the number of the segment that
failed during the test, or the number of the test that
failed and the number of the segment in which the test was
run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both numbers
into a single byte. The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
first error is printed in hexadecimal notation. On Linux
systems the smartmontools web page has instructions about
how to convert this LBA address to the name of the disk file
containing the erroneous block. If provided, the SCSI Sense
Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense
Code Qualifier (ASQ) are also printed. The self tests can be
run using the &acute;&minus;t&acute; option described below
(using the ATA test terminology).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xselftest[,NUM][,selftest]</i>

(General Purpose Log address 0x07). Unlike the SMART
self-test log (see &acute;&minus;l selftest&acute; above),
it supports 48-bit LBA and logs with more than one sector.
Each sector holds up to 19 log entries. The actual number of
log sectors is vendor specific, typical values are 1

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>selective</i>
&minus; [ATA only] Please see the &acute;&minus;t
select&acute; option below for a description of selective
self-tests. The selective self-test log shows the start/end
Logical Block Addresses (LBA) of each of the five test
spans, and their current test status. If the span is being
tested or the remainder of the disk is being read-scanned,
the current 65536-sector block of LBAs being tested is also
displayed. The selective self-test log also shows if a
read-scan of the remainder of the disk will be carried out
after the selective self-test has completed (see
&acute;&minus;t afterselect&acute; option) and the time
delay before restarting this read-scan if it is interrupted
(see &acute;&minus;t pending&acute; option).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>directory[,gs]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] if the device supports the General
Purpose Logging feature set (ATA-6 and above) then this
prints the Log Directory (the log at address 0). The Log
Directory shows what logs are available and their length in
sectors (512 bytes). The contents of the logs at address 1
[Summary SMART error log] and at address 6 [SMART self-test
log] may be printed using the previously-described
<i>error</i> and <i>selftest</i> arguments to this option.
If your version of smartctl supports 48-bit ATA commands,
both the General Purpose Log (GPL) and SMART Log (SL)
directories are printed in one combined table. The output
can be restricted to the GPL directory or SL directory by
&acute;&minus;l directory,q&acute; or &acute;&minus;l
directory,s&acute; respectively.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>background</i>
&minus; [SCSI only] the background scan results log outputs
information derived from Background Media Scans (BMS) done
after power up and/or periodically (e.g. every 24 hours) on
recent SCSI disks. If supported, the BMS status is output
first, indicating whether a background scan is currently
underway (and if so a progress percentage), the amount of
time the disk has been powered up and the number of scans
already completed. Then there is a header and a line for
each background scan &quot;event&quot;. These will typically
be either recovered or unrecoverable errors. That latter
group may need some attention. There is a description of the
background scan mechanism in section 4.18 of SBC-3 revision
6 (see www.t10.org ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>scttemp,
scttempsts, scttemphist</i> &minus; [ATA only] prints the
disk temperature information provided by the SMART Command
Transport (SCT) commands. The option
&acute;scttempsts&acute; prints current temperature and
temperature ranges returned by the SCT Status command,
&acute;scttemphist&acute; prints temperature limits and the
temperature history table returned by the SCT Data Table
command, and &acute;scttemp&acute; prints both. The
temperature values are preserved across power cycles. The
logging interval can be configured with the &acute;&minus;l
scttempint,N[,p]&acute; option, see below. The SCT commands
were introduced in ATA8-ACS and were also supported by many
ATA-7 disks.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>scttempint,N[,p]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] clears the SCT temperature history table
and sets the time interval for temperature logging to N
minutes. If &acute;,p&acute; is specified, the setting is
preserved across power cycles. Otherwise, the setting is
volatile and will be reverted to the last non-volatile
setting by the next hard reset. The default interval is
vendor specific, typical values are 1, 2, or 5 minutes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>scterc[,READTIME,WRITETIME]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] prints values and descriptions of the SCT
Error Recovery Control settings. These are equivalent to
TLER (as used by Western Digital), CCTL (as used by Samsung

WRITETIME arguments (deciseconds) set the specified values.
Values of 0 disable the feature, other values less than 65
are probably not supported. For RAID configurations, this is
typically set to 70,70 deciseconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>devstat[,PAGE]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] prints values and descriptions of the ATA
Device Statistics log pages (General Purpose Log address

list of supported pages is printed. Device Statistics was
introduced in ACS-2 and is only supported by some recent
devices (e.g. Hitachi 7K3000, Intel 320, 330, 520 and 710
Series SSDs, Crucial/Micron m4 SSDs).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sataphy[,reset]</i>

smartctl &minus;t select,100000000&minus;max /dev/hda <br>
run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of the
disk. The &acute;&minus;t&acute; option can be given up to
five times, to test up to five spans. For example the
command: <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,0&minus;100 &minus;t
select,1000&minus;2000 /dev/hda <br>
runs a self test on two spans. The first span consists of
101 LBAs and the second span consists of 1001 LBAs. Note
that the spans can overlap partially or completely, for
example: <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,0&minus;10 &minus;t
select,5&minus;15 &minus;t select,10&minus;20 /dev/hda <br>
The results of the selective self-test can be obtained (both

log, using the &acute;&minus;l selftest&acute; option to
smartctl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Selective self
tests are particularly useful as disk capacities increase:
an extended self test (smartctl &minus;t long) can take

problems at a particular range of Logical Block Addresses
(LBAs).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Selective

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
variants of the selective self-test command use spans based
on the ranges from past tests already stored on the
disk:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>select,redo[+SIZE]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] redo the last SMART Selective Self Test
using the same LBA range. The starting LBA is identical to
the LBA used by last test, same for ending LBA unless a new
span size is specified by optional +SIZE argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example the
commands: <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,10&minus;20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,redo /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,redo+20 /dev/hda <br>
have the same effect as: <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,10&minus;20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,10&minus;20 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,10&minus;29 /dev/hda</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>select,next[+SIZE]</i>
&minus; [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test on the
LBA range which follows the range of the last test. The
starting LBA is set to (ending LBA +1) of the last test. A
new span size may be specified by the optional +SIZE
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example the
commands: <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,0&minus;999 /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,next /dev/hda <br>
smartctl &minus;t select,next+2000 /dev/hda <br>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the last
test ended at the last LBA of the disk, the new range starts
at LBA 0. The span size of the last span of a disk is

<h2>ATA, SCSI command sets and SAT
<a name="ATA, SCSI command sets and SAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the past
there has been a clear distinction between storage devices
that used the ATA and SCSI command sets. This distinction
was often reflected in their device naming and hardware. Now
various SCSI transports (e.g. SAS, FC and iSCSI) can
interconnect to both SCSI disks (e.g. FC and SAS) and ATA
disks (especially SATA). USB and IEEE 1394 storage devices
use the SCSI command set externally but almost always
contain ATA or SATA disks (or flash). The storage subsystems
in some operating systems have started to remove the
distinction between ATA and SCSI in their device naming
policies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">99% of
operations that an OS performs on a disk involve the SCSI
INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY, READ and WRITE commands, or their
ATA equivalents. Since the SCSI commands are slightly more
general than their ATA equivalents, many OSes are generating
SCSI commands (mainly READ and WRITE) and letting a lower
level translate them to their ATA equivalents as the need
arises. An important note here is that &quot;lower
level&quot; may be in external equipment and hence outside
the control of an OS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI to ATA
Translation (SAT) is a standard (ANSI INCITS 431-2007) that
specifies how this translation is done. For the other 1% of
operations that an OS performs on a disk, SAT provides two
options. First is an optional ATA PASS-THROUGH SCSI command
(there are two variants). The second is a translation from
the closest SCSI command. Most current interest is in the
&quot;pass-through&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The relevance
to smartmontools (and hence smartctl) is that its
interactions with disks fall solidly into the &quot;1%&quot;
category. So even if the OS can happily treat (and name) a
disk as &quot;SCSI&quot;, smartmontools needs to detect the
native command set and act accordingly. As more storage
manufacturers (including external SATA drives) comply with
SAT, smartmontools is able to automatically distinguish the
native command set of the device. In some cases the
&rsquo;&minus;d sat&rsquo; option is needed on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
virtual disks which typically have no useful information to
convey to smartmontools, but could conceivably in the
future. An example of a virtual disk is the OS&rsquo;s view
of a RAID 1 box. There are most likely two SATA disks inside
a RAID 1 box. Addressing those SATA disks from a distant OS
is a challenge for smartmontools. Another approach is
running a tool like smartmontools inside the RAID 1 box
(e.g. a Network Attached Storage (NAS) box) and fetching the
logs via a browser.</p>

&minus;&minus;smart=on &minus;&minus;offlineauto=on
&minus;&minus;saveauto=on /dev/hda</b> <br>
Enable SMART on drive /dev/hda, enable automatic offline
testing every four hours, and enable autosaving of SMART
Attributes. This is a good start-up line for your
system&acute;s init files. You can issue this command on a
running system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl
&minus;t long /dev/hdc</b> <br>
Begin an extended self-test of drive /dev/hdc. You can issue
this command on a running system. The results can be seen in
the self-test log visible with the &acute;&minus;l
selftest&acute; option after it has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl
&minus;s on &minus;t offline /dev/hda</b> <br>
Enable SMART on the disk, and begin an immediate offline
test of drive /dev/hda. You can issue this command on a
running system. The results are only used to update the
SMART Attributes, visible with the &acute;&minus;A&acute;
option. If any device errors occur, they are logged to the
SMART error log, which can be seen with the &acute;&minus;l
error&acute; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>smartctl
&minus;q silent &minus;a /dev/hda</b> <br>
Examine all SMART data for device /dev/hda, but produce no
printed output. You must use the exit status (the <b>$?</b>
shell variable) to learn if any Attributes are out of bound,
if the SMART status is failing, if there are errors recorded
in the self-test log, or if there are errors recorded in the
disk error log.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return
values of <b>smartctl</b> are defined by a bitmask. If all
is well with the disk, the return value (exit status) of
<b>smartctl</b> is 0 (all bits turned off). If a problem
occurs, or an error, potential error, or fault is detected,
then a non-zero status is returned. In this case, the eight
different bits in the return value have the following
meanings for ATA disks; some of these values may also be
returned for SCSI disks.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To test within
the shell for whether or not the different bits are turned
on or off, you can use the following type of construction
(this is bash syntax): <b><br>
smartstat=$(($? &amp; 8))</b> <br>
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status <b>$?</b>
(since 8=2^3). The shell variable $smartstat will be nonzero
if SMART status check returned &quot;disk failing&quot; and
zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This bash
script prints all status bits: <br>
status=$? <br>
for ((i=0; i&lt;8; i++)); do <br>
echo &quot;Bit $i: $((status &amp; 2**i &amp;&amp; 1))&quot;
<br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An introductory
article about smartmontools is <i>Monitoring Hard Disks with
SMART</i>, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004,
pages 74-77. This is
<b>http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983</b> online.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you would
like to understand better how SMART works, and what it does,
a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the
first volume of the &acute;AT Attachment with Packet
Interface-7&acute; (ATA/ATAPI-7) specification Revision 4b.
This documents the SMART functionality which the
<b>smartmontools</b> utilities provide access to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functioning
of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i revision 2
and the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications. These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.</p>
