<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">slapd&minus;ldap
&minus; LDAP backend to slapd</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The LDAP
backend to <b>slapd</b>(8) is not an actual database;
instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to
another LDAP server. While processing requests it will also
chase referrals, so that referrals are fully processed
instead of being returned to the slapd client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sessions that
explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always create
their own private connection to the remote LDAP server.
Anonymous sessions will share a single anonymous connection
to the remote server. For sessions bound through other
mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will share the
same connection. This connection pooling strategy can
enhance the proxy&rsquo;s efficiency by reducing the
overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ldap
database can also act as an information service, i.e. the
identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the
remote server, possibly in some modified form. For this
purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server with some
administrative identity, and, if required, authorizes the
asserted identity. See the <i>idassert&minus;</i>* rules
below. The administrative identity of the proxy, on the
remote server, must be allowed to authorize by means of
appropriate <b>authzTo</b> rules; see <b>slapd.conf</b>(5)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The proxy
instance of <b>slapd</b>(8) must contain schema information
for the attributes and objectClasses used in filters,
request DNs and request-related data in general. It should
also contain schema information for the data returned by the
proxied server. It is the responsibility of the proxy
administrator to keep the schema of the proxy lined up with
that of the proxied server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: When
looping back to the same instance of <b>slapd</b>(8), each
connection requires a new thread; as a consequence,
<b>slapd</b>(8) must be compiled with thread support, and
the <b>threads</b> parameter may need some tuning; in those
cases, one may consider using <b>slapd&minus;relay</b>(5)
instead, which performs the relayed operation internally and
thus reuses the same connection.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
<b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the LDAP backend
database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database
ldap&quot; line and come before any subsequent
&quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; lines. Other
database options are described in the <b>slapd.conf</b>(5)
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: In early
versions of back-ldap it was recommended to always set</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">lastmod off</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for <b>ldap</b>
and <b>meta</b> databases. This was required because
operational attributes related to entry creation and
modification should not be proxied, as they could be
mistakenly written to the target server(s), generating an
error. The current implementation automatically sets lastmod
to <b>off</b>, so its use is redundant and should be
omitted. <b><br>
uri &lt;ldapurl&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">LDAP server to use. Multiple
URIs can be set in a single <b>ldapurl</b> argument,
resulting in the underlying library automatically calling
the first server of the list that responds, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>uri
&quot;ldap://host/ ldap://backup&minus;host/&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The URI list is
space- or comma-separated. Whenever the server that responds
is not the first one in the list, the list is rearranged and
the responsive server is moved to the head, so that it will
be first contacted the next time a connection needs to be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows to define the parameters
of the authentication method that is internally used by the
proxy to collect info related to access control, and
whenever an operation occurs with the identity of the rootdn
of the LDAP proxy database. The identity defined by this
directive, according to the properties associated to the
authentication method, is supposed to have read access on
the target server to attributes used on the proxy for ACL
checking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
risk of giving away such values; they are only used to check
permissions. The default is to use <b>simple</b> bind, with
empty <i>binddn</i> and <i>credentials</i>, which means that
the related operations will be performed anonymously. If not
set, and if <b>idassert&minus;bind</b> is defined, this
latter identity is used instead. See
<b>idassert&minus;bind</b> for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The connection
between the proxy database and the remote server associated
to this identity is cached regardless of the lifespan of the
client-proxy connection that first established it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>This
identity is not implicitly used by the proxy when the client
connects anonymously.</b> The <b>idassert&minus;bind</b>
feature, instead, in some cases can be crafted to implement
that behavior, which is <i>intrinsically unsafe and should
be used with extreme care</i>. This directive obsoletes
<b>acl&minus;authcDN</b>, and <b>acl&minus;passwd</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The TLS
settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings,
except for <b>tls_reqcert</b> which defaults to
&quot;demand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>cancel
{ABANDON|ignore|exop[&minus;discover]}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines how to handle operation
cancellation. By default, <b>abandon</b> is invoked, so the
operation is abandoned immediately. If set to <b>ignore</b>,
no action is taken and any further response is ignored; this
may result in further response messages to be queued for
that connection, so it is recommended that long lasting
connections are timed out either by
<i>idle&minus;timeout</i> or <i>conn&minus;ttl</i>, so that
resources eventually get released. If set to <b>exop</b>, a
<i>cancel</i> operation (RFC 3909) is issued, resulting in
the cancellation of the current operation; the <i>cancel</i>
operation waits for remote server response, so its use may
not be recommended. If set to <b>exop&minus;discover</b>,
support of the <i>cancel</i> extended operation is detected
by reading the remote server&rsquo;s root DSE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chase&minus;referrals
{YES|no}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">enable/disable automatic
referral chasing, which is delegated to the underlying
libldap, with rebinding eventually performed if the
<b>rebind&minus;as&minus;user</b> directive is used. The
default is to chase referrals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>conn&minus;ttl
&lt;time&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive causes a cached
connection to be dropped and recreated after a given ttl,
regardless of being idle or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert&minus;authzFrom
&lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">if defined, selects what
<i>local</i> identities are authorized to exploit the
identity assertion feature. The string
<b>&lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b> follows the rules defined for
the <i>authzFrom</i> attribute. See <b>slapd.conf</b>(5),
section related to <b>authz&minus;policy</b>, for details on
the syntax of this field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows to define the parameters
of the authentication method that is internally used by the
proxy to authorize connections that are authenticated by
other databases. Direct binds are always proxied without any
idassert handling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The identity
defined by this directive, according to the properties
associated to the authentication method, is supposed to have
auth access on the target server to attributes used on the
proxy for authentication and authorization, and to be
allowed to authorize the users. This requires to have
<b>proxyAuthz</b> privileges on a wide set of DNs, e.g.
<b>authzTo=dn.subtree:&quot;&quot;</b>, and the remote
server to have <b>authz&minus;policy</b> set to <b>to</b> or
<b>both</b>. See <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details on these
statements and for remarks and drawbacks about their usage.
The supported bindmethods are</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>none|simple|sasl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>none</b> is the default, i.e. no <i>identity
assertion</i> is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The authz
parameter is used to instruct the SASL bind to exploit
<b>native</b> SASL authorization, if available; since
connections are cached, this should only be used when
authorizing with a fixed identity (e.g. by means of the
<b>authzDN</b> or <b>authzID</b> parameters). Otherwise, the
default <b>proxyauthz</b> is used, i.e. the proxyAuthz
control (Proxied Authorization, RFC 4370) is added to all
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The supported
modes are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;mode&gt;
:= {legacy|anonymous|none|self}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is not present, and <b>authzId</b> is
given, the proxy always authorizes that identity.
<b>&lt;authorization ID&gt;</b> can be</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>u:&lt;user&gt;</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[dn:]&lt;DN&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The former is
supposed to be expanded by the remote server according to
the authz rules; see <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details. In
the latter case, whether or not the <b>dn:</b> prefix is
present, the string must pass DN validation and
normalization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
mode is <b>legacy</b>, which implies that the proxy will
either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a SASL
bind as the <i>authcID</i> and assert the client&rsquo;s
identity when it is not anonymous. The other modes imply
that the proxy will always either perform a simple bind as
the <i>authcDN</i> or a SASL bind as the <i>authcID</i>,
unless restricted by <b>idassert&minus;authzFrom</b> rules
(see below), in which case the operation will fail;
eventually, it will assert some other identity according to
<b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>. Other identity assertion modes are
<b>anonymous</b> and <b>self</b>, which respectively mean
that the <i>empty</i> or the <i>client</i>&rsquo;s identity
will be asserted; <b>none</b>, which means that no
proxyAuthz control will be used, so the <i>authcDN</i> or
the <i>authcID</i> identity will be asserted. For all modes
that require the use of the <i>proxyAuthz</i> control, on
the remote server the proxy identity must have appropriate
<i>authzTo</i> permissions, or the asserted identities must
have appropriate <i>authzFrom</i> permissions. Note,
however, that the ID assertion feature is mostly useful when
the asserted identities do not exist on the remote
server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Flags can
be</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>override,[non&minus;]prescriptive,proxy&minus;authz&minus;[non&minus;]critical</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>override</b> flag is used, identity assertion takes place
even when the database is authorizing for the identity of
the client, i.e. after binding with the provided identity,
and thus authenticating it, the proxy performs the identity
assertion using the configured identity and authentication
method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>prescriptive</b> flag is used (the default), operations
fail with <i>inappropriateAuthentication</i> for those
identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
<b>idassert&minus;authzFrom</b> patterns. If the
<b>non&minus;prescriptive</b> flag is used, operations are
performed anonymously for those identities whose assertion
is not allowed by the <b>idassert&minus;authzFrom</b>
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>proxy&minus;authz&minus;non&minus;critical</b> flag is
used (the default), the proxyAuthz control is not marked as
critical, in violation of RFC 4370. Use of
<b>proxy&minus;authz&minus;critical</b> is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The TLS
settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings,
except for <b>tls_reqcert</b> which defaults to
&quot;demand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The identity
associated to this directive is also used for privileged
operations whenever <b>idassert&minus;bind</b> is defined
and <b>acl&minus;bind</b> is not. See <b>acl&minus;bind</b>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This directive
obsoletes <b>idassert&minus;authcDN</b>,
<b>idassert&minus;passwd</b>, <b>idassert&minus;mode</b>,
and <b>idassert&minus;method</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert-passthru
&lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">if defined, selects what
<i>local</i> identities bypass the identity assertion
feature. Those identities need to be known by the remote
host. The string <b>&lt;authz-regexp&gt;</b> follows the
rules defined for the <i>authzFrom</i> attribute. See
<b>slapd.conf</b>(5), section related to
<b>authz&minus;policy</b>, for details on the syntax of this
field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idle&minus;timeout
&lt;time&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive causes a cached
connection to be dropped an recreated after it has been idle
for the specified time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>keepalive
&lt;idle&gt;:&lt;probes&gt;:&lt;interval&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>keepalive</b> parameter
sets the values of <i>idle</i>, <i>probes</i>, and
<i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive;
<i>idle</i> is the number of seconds a connection needs to
remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes;
<i>probes</i> is the maximum number of keepalive probes TCP
should send before dropping the connection; <i>interval</i>
is interval in seconds between individual keepalive probes.
Only some systems support the customization of these values;
the <b>keepalive</b> parameter is ignored otherwise, and
system-wide settings are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>network&minus;timeout
&lt;time&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the network timeout value
after which <b>poll</b>(2)/<b>select</b>(2) following a
<b>connect</b>(2) returns in case of no activity. The value
is in seconds, and it can be specified as for
<b>idle&minus;timeout</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>norefs
&lt;NO|yes&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <b>yes</b>, do not return
search reference responses. By default, they are returned
unless request is LDAPv2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noundeffilter
&lt;NO|yes&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <b>yes</b>, return success
instead of searching if a filter is undefined or contains
undefined portions. By default, the search is propagated
after replacing undefined portions with
<b>(!(objectClass=*))</b>, which corresponds to the empty
result set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>onerr
{CONTINUE|stop}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive allows to select
the behavior in case an error is returned by the remote
server during a search. The default, <b>continue</b>,
consists in returning success. If the value is set to
<b>stop</b>, the error is returned to the client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>protocol&minus;version
{0,2,3}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive indicates what
protocol version must be used to contact the remote server.
If set to 0 (the default), the proxy uses the same protocol
version used by the client, otherwise the requested protocol
is used. The proxy returns <i>unwillingToPerform</i> if an
operation that is incompatible with the requested protocol
is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>proxy&minus;whoami
{NO|yes}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turns on proxying of the WhoAmI
extended operation. If this option is given, back-ldap will
replace slapd&rsquo;s original WhoAmI routine with its own.
On slapd sessions that were authenticated by back-ldap, the
WhoAmI request will be forwarded to the remote LDAP server.
Other sessions will be handled by the local slapd, as
before. This option is mainly useful in conjunction with
Proxy Authorization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>quarantine
&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[;&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[...]]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turns on quarantine of URIs
that returned <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i>, so that an attempt to
reconnect only occurs at given intervals instead of any time
a client requests an operation. The pattern is: retry only
after at least <i>interval</i> seconds elapsed since last
attempt, for exactly <i>num</i> times; then use the next
pattern. If <i>num</i> for the last pattern is
&quot;<b>+</b>&quot;, it retries forever; otherwise, no more
retries occur. The process can be restarted by resetting the
<i>olcDbQuarantine</i> attribute of the database entry in
the configuration backend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>rebind&minus;as&minus;user
{NO|yes}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is given, the
client&rsquo;s bind credentials are remembered for rebinds,
when trying to re-establish a broken connection, or when
chasing a referral, if <b>chase&minus;referrals</b> is set
to <i>yes</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>session&minus;tracking&minus;request
{NO|yes}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adds session tracking control
for all requests. The client&rsquo;s IP and hostname, and
the identity associated to each request, if known, are sent
to the remote server for informational purposes. This
directive is incompatible with setting
<i>protocol&minus;version</i> to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>single&minus;conn
{NO|yes}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Discards current cached
connection when the client rebinds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>t&minus;f&minus;support
{NO|yes|discover}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">enable if the remote server
supports absolute filters (see <i>RFC 4526</i> for details).
If set to <b>discover</b>, support is detected by reading
the remote server&rsquo;s root DSE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>timeout
[&lt;op&gt;=]&lt;val&gt; [...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive allows to set
per-operation timeouts. Operations can be</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;op&gt;
::= bind, add, delete, modrdn, modify, compare,
search</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The overall
duration of the <b>search</b> operation is controlled either
by the <b>timelimit</b> parameter or by server-side enforced
time limits (see <b>timelimit</b> and <b>limits</b> in
<b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details). This <b>timeout</b>
parameter controls how long the target can be irresponsive
before the operation is aborted. Timeout is meaningless for
the remaining operations, <b>unbind</b> and <b>abandon</b>,
which do not imply any response, while it is not yet
implemented in currently supported <b>extended</b>
operations. If no operation is specified, the timeout
<b>val</b> affects all supported operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note: if the
timelimit is exceeded, the operation is cancelled (according
to the <b>cancel</b> directive); the protocol does not
provide any means to rollback operations, so the client will
not be notified about the result of the operation, which may
eventually succeeded or not. In case the timeout is exceeded
during a bind operation, the connection is destroyed,
according to RFC4511.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note: in some
cases, this backend may issue binds prior to other
operations (e.g. to bind anonymously or with some prescribed
identity according to the <b>idassert&minus;bind</b>
directive). In this case, the timeout of the operation that
resulted in the bind is used.</p>

backend has been heavily reworked between releases 2.2 and
2.3, and subsequently between 2.3 and 2.4. As a side-effect,
some of the traditional directives have been deprecated and
should be no longer used, as they might disappear in future
releases. <b><br>
acl&minus;authcDN &lt;administrative DN for access control
purposes&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Formerly known as the
<b>binddn</b>, it is the DN that is used to query the target
server for acl checking; it is supposed to have read access
on the target server to attributes used on the proxy for acl
checking. There is no risk of giving away such values; they
are only used to check permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
acl&minus;authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used by
the proxy when the client connects anonymously.</b> The
<b>idassert&minus;*</b> feature can be used (at own risk)
for that purpose instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This directive
is obsoleted by the <b>binddn</b> arg of
<b>acl&minus;bind</b> when <i>bindmethod</i>=<b>simple</b>,
and will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>acl&minus;passwd
&lt;password&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Formerly known as the
<b>bindpw</b>, it is the password used with the above
<b>acl&minus;authcDN</b> directive. This directive is
obsoleted by the <b>credentials</b> arg of
<b>acl&minus;bind</b> when <i>bindmethod</i>=<b>simple</b>,
and will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert&minus;authcDN
&lt;administrative DN for proxyAuthz purposes&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">DN which is used to propagate
the client&rsquo;s identity to the target by means of the
proxyAuthz control when the client does not belong to the
DIT fragment that is being proxied by back-ldap. This
directive is obsoleted by the <b>binddn</b> arg of
<b>idassert&minus;bind</b> when
<i>bindmethod</i>=<b>simple</b>, and will be dismissed in
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert&minus;passwd
&lt;password&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Password used with the
<b>idassert&minus;authcDN</b> above. This directive is
obsoleted by the <b>crendentials</b> arg of
<b>idassert&minus;bind</b> when
<i>bindmethod</i>=<b>simple</b>, and will be dismissed in
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert&minus;mode
&lt;mode&gt; [&lt;flags&gt;]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">defines what type of
<i>identity assertion</i> is used. This directive is
obsoleted by the <b>mode</b> arg of
<b>idassert&minus;bind</b>, and will be dismissed in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>idassert&minus;method
&lt;method&gt; [&lt;saslargs&gt;]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive is obsoleted by
the <b>bindmethod</b> arg of <b>idassert&minus;bind</b>, and
will be dismissed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>port &lt;port&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this directive is no longer
supported. Use the <b>uri</b> directive as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>server
&lt;hostname[:port]&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this directive is no longer
supported. Use the <b>uri</b> directive as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>suffixmassage, map,
rewrite*</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These directives are no longer
supported by back-ldap; their functionality is now delegated
to the <b>rwm</b> overlay. Essentially, add a statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>overlay
rwm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">first, and
prefix all rewrite/map statements with <b>rwm&minus;</b> to
obtain the original behavior. See <b>slapo&minus;rwm</b>(5)
for details.</p>

<h2>ACCESS CONTROL
<a name="ACCESS CONTROL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>ldap</b>
backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in
<b>slapd.access</b>(5). In general, access checking is
delegated to the remote server(s). Only <b>read (=r)</b>
access to the <b>entry</b> pseudo-attribute and to the other
attribute values of the entries returned by the
<b>search</b> operation is honored, which is performed by
the frontend.</p>

<h2>OVERLAYS
<a name="OVERLAYS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The LDAP
backend provides basic proxying functionalities to many
overlays. The <b>chain</b> overlay, described in
<b>slapo&minus;chain</b>(5), and the <b>translucent</b>
overlay, described in <b>slapo&minus;translucent</b>(5),
deserve a special mention.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely,
there are many overlays that are best used in conjunction
with the LDAP backend. The <b>proxycache</b> overlay allows
caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local
database. See <b>slapo&minus;pcache</b>(5) for details. The
<b>rwm</b> overlay provides DN rewrite and
attribute/objectClass mapping capabilities to the underlying
database. See <b>slapo&minus;rwm</b>(5) for details.</p>
