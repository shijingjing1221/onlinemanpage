<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>ntfs-3g</b></i>
is an NTFS driver, which can create, remove, rename, move
files, directories, hard links, and streams; it can read and
write files, including streams, sparse files and
transparently compressed files; it can handle special files
like symbolic links, devices, and FIFOs; moreover it
provides standard management of file ownership and
permissions, including POSIX ACLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It comes in two
variants <b>ntfs-3g</b> and <b>lowntfs-3g</b> with a few
differences mentioned below in relevant options
descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>volume</i> to be mounted can be either a block device or
an image file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Windows
hibernation and fast restarting</b> <br>
On computers which can be dual-booted into Windows or Linux,
Windows has to be fully shut down before booting into Linux,
otherwise the NTFS file systems on internal disks may be
left in an inconsistent state and changes made by Linux may
be ignored by Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, Windows may
not be left in hibernation when starting Linux, in order to
avoid inconsistencies. Moreover, the fast restart feature
available on recent Windows systems has to be disabled. This
can be achieved by issuing as an Administrator the Windows
command which disables both hibernation and fast restarting
:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">powercfg /h
off</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Access
Handling and Security</b> <br>
By default, files and directories are owned by the effective
user and group of the mounting process, and everybody has
full read, write, execution and directory browsing
permissions. You can also assign permissions to a single
user by using the <b>uid</b> and/or the <b>gid</b> options
together with the <b>umask,</b> or <b>fmask</b> and
<b>dmask</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Doing so,
Windows users have full access to the files created by
<b>ntfs-3g.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But, by setting
the <b>permissions</b> option, you can benefit from the full
ownership and permissions features as defined by POSIX.
Moreover, by defining a Windows-to-Linux user mapping, the
ownerships and permissions are even applied to Windows users
and conversely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>ntfs-3g</b> is set setuid-root then non-root users will
be also able to mount volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Windows
Filename Compatibility</b> <br>
NTFS supports several filename namespaces: DOS, Win32 and
POSIX. While the <b>ntfs-3g</b> driver handles all of them,
it always creates new files in the POSIX namespace for
maximum portability and interoperability reasons. This means
that filenames are case sensitive and all characters are
allowed except &rsquo;/&rsquo; and &rsquo;\0&rsquo;. This is
perfectly legal on Windows, though some application may get
confused. The option <b>windows_names</b> may be used to
apply Windows restrictions to new file names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alternate
Data Streams (ADS)</b> <br>
NTFS stores all data in streams. Every file has exactly one
unnamed data stream and can have many named data streams.
The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data stream.
By default, <b>ntfs-3g</b> will only read the unnamed data
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By using the
options &quot;streams_interface=windows&quot;, with the
ntfs-3g driver (not possible with lowntfs-3g), you will be
able to read any named data streams, simply by specifying
the stream&rsquo;s name after a colon. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">cat
some.mp3:artist</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Named data
streams act like normal files, so you can read from them,
write to them and even delete them (using rm). You can list
all the named data streams a file has by getting the
&quot;ntfs.streams.list&quot; extended attribute.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Below is a
summary of the options that <b>ntfs-3g</b> accepts. <b><br>
uid=</b><i>value</i> and <b>gid=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the owner and the group of
files and directories. The values are numerical. The
defaults are the uid and gid of the current process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>umask=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the bitmask of the file and
directory permissions that are not present. The value is
given in octal. The default value is 0 which means full
access to everybody.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fmask=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the bitmask of the file
permissions that are not present. The value is given in
octal. The default value is 0 which means full access to
everybody.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dmask=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the bitmask of the
directory permissions that are not present. The value is
given in octal. The default value is 0 which means full
access to everybody.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>usermapping=</b><i>file-name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use file <i>file-name</i> as
the user mapping file instead of the default
<b>.NTFS-3G/UserMapping</b>. If <i>file-name</i> defines a
full path, the file must be located on a partition
previously mounted. If it defines a relative path, it is
interpreted relative to the root of NTFS partition being
mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When a user
mapping file is defined, the options <b>uid=</b>,
<b>gid=</b>, <b>umask=</b>, <b>fmask=</b>, <b>dmask=</b> and
<b>silent</b> are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>permissions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set standard permissions on
created files and use standard access control. This option
is set by default when a user mapping file is present.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>acl</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Enable setting Posix ACLs on created files and use them
for access control. This option is only available on
specific builds. It is set by default when a user mapping
file is present and the <b>permissions</b> mount option is
not set.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>inherit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When creating a new file, set
its initial protections according to inheritance rules
defined in parent directory. These rules deviate from Posix
specifications, but yield a better Windows compatibility.
The <b>permissions</b> option or a valid user mapping file
is required for this option to be effective.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>ro</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Mount filesystem read&minus;only. Useful if Windows is
hibernated or the NTFS journal file is unclean.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>locale=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option can be useful when
wanting a language specific locale environment. It is
however discouraged as it leads to files with untranslatable
chars to not be visible.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>force</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option is obsolete. It has been superseded by the
<b>recover</b> and <b>norecover</b> options.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>recover</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Recover and try to mount a
partition which was not unmounted properly by Windows. The
Windows logfile is cleared, which may cause inconsistencies.
Currently this is the default option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>norecover</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not try to mount a partition
which was not unmounted properly by Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ignore_case</b> (only with
lowntfs-3g)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ignore character case when
accessing a file (<b>FOO</b>, <b>Foo</b>, <b>foo</b>, etc.
designate the same file). All files are displayed with lower
case in directory listings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>remove_hiberfile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Unlike in case of read-only
mount, the read-write mount is denied if the NTFS volume is
hibernated. One needs either to resume Windows and shutdown
it properly, or use this option which will remove the
Windows hibernation file. Please note, this means that the
saved Windows session will be completely lost. Use this
option under your own responsibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>atime, noatime,
relatime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>atime</b> option updates
inode access time for each access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>noatime</b> option disables inode access time updates
which can speed up file operations and prevent sleeping
(notebook) disks spinning up too often thus saving energy
and disk lifetime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>relatime</b> option is very similar to <b>noatime.</b> It
updates inode access times relative to modify or change
time. The access time is only updated if the previous access
time was earlier than the current modify or change time.
Unlike <b>noatime</b> this option doesn&rsquo;t break
applications that need to know if a file has been read since
the last time it was modified. This is the default
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delay_mtime[= value]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only update the file
modification time and the file change time of a file when it
is closed or when the indicated delay since the previous
update has elapsed. The argument is a number of seconds,
with a default value of 60. This is mainly useful for big
files which are kept open for a long time and written to
without changing their size, such as databases or file
system images mounted as loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>show_sys_files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show the metafiles in directory
listings. Otherwise the default behaviour is to hide the
metafiles, which are special files used to store the NTFS
structure. Please note that even when this option is
specified, &quot;$MFT&quot; may not be visible due to a
glibc bug. Furthermore, irrespectively of show_sys_files,
all files are accessible by name, for example you can always
do &quot;ls &minus;l &rsquo;$UpCase&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hide_hid_files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Hide the hidden files and
directories in directory listings, the hidden files and
directories being the ones whose NTFS attribute have the
hidden flag set. The hidden files will not be selected when
using wildcards in commands, but all files and directories
remain accessible by full name, for example you can always
display the Windows trash bin directory by : &quot;ls
&minus;ld &rsquo;$RECYCLE.BIN&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hide_dot_files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the hidden flag in the NTFS
attribute for created files and directories whose first
character of the name is a dot. Such files and directories
normally do not appear in directory listings, and when the
flag is set they do not appear in Windows directory displays
either. When a file is renamed or linked with a new name,
the hidden flag is adjusted to the latest name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>windows_names</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option prevents files,
directories and extended attributes to be created with a
name not allowed by windows, because</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">- it contains
some not allowed character, <br>
- or the last character is a space or a dot, <br>
- or the name is reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The forbidden
characters are the nine characters &quot; * / : &lt; &gt; ?
\ | and those whose code is less than 0x20, and the reserved
names are CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1..COM9, LPT1..LPT9, with
no suffix or followed by a dot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Existing such
files can still be read (and renamed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allow_other</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option overrides the
security measure restricting file access to the user
mounting the filesystem. This option is only allowed to
root, but this restriction can be overridden by the
&rsquo;user_allow_other&rsquo; option in the /etc/fuse.conf
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>max_read=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With this option the maximum
size of read operations can be set. The default is infinite.
Note that the size of read requests is limited anyway to 32
pages (which is 128kbyte on i386).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>silent</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Do nothing, without returning any error, on chmod and
chown operations and on permission checking errors, when the
<b>permissions</b> option is not set and no user mapping
file is defined. This option is on by default, and when set
off (through option <b>no_def_opts</b>) ownership and
permissions parameters have to be set.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>no_def_opts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default ntfs-3g acts as if
&quot;silent&quot; (ignore permission errors when
permissions are not enabled), &quot;allow_other&quot; (allow
any user to access files) and &quot;nonempty&quot; (allow
mounting on non-empty directories) were set, and
&quot;no_def_opts&quot; cancels these default options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>streams_interface=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls how the
user can access Alternate Data Streams (ADS) or in other
words, named data streams. It can be set to, one of
<b>none</b>, <b>windows</b> or <b>xattr</b>. If the option
is set to <b>none</b>, the user will have no access to the
named data streams. If it is set to <b>windows</b> (not
possible with lowntfs-3g), then the user can access them
just like in Windows (eg. cat file:stream). If it&rsquo;s
set to <b>xattr</b>, then the named data streams are mapped
to xattrs and user can manipulate them using
<b>{get,set}fattr</b> utilities. The default is
<b>xattr</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>user_xattr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as
<b>streams_interface=</b><i>xattr</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>efs_raw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option should only be used
in backup or restore situation. It changes the apparent size
of files and the behavior of read and write operation so
that encrypted files can be saved and restored without being
decrypted. The <b>user.ntfs.efsinfo</b> extended attribute
has also to be saved and restored for the file to be
decrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>compression</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option enables creating
new transparently compressed files in directories marked for
compression. A directory is marked for compression by
setting the bit 11 (value 0x00000800) in its Windows
attribute. In such a directory, new files are created
compressed and new subdirectories are themselves marked for
compression. The option and the flag have no effect on
existing files. Currently this is the default option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nocompression</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option disables creating
new transparently compressed files in directories marked for
compression. Existing compressed files can still be read and
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>big_writes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option prevents fuse from
splitting write buffers into 4K chunks, enabling big write
buffers to be transferred from the application in a single
step (up to some system limit, generally 128K bytes).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>debug</b></p></td>

<td width="78%">


<p>Makes ntfs-3g to print a lot of debug output from
libntfs-3g and FUSE.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>no_detach</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Makes ntfs-3g to not detach
from terminal and print some debug output.</p>

<h2>USER MAPPING
<a name="USER MAPPING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NTFS uses
specific ids to record the ownership of files instead of the
<b>uid</b> and <b>gid</b> used by Linux. As a consequence a
mapping between the ids has to be defined for ownerships to
be recorded into NTFS and recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
this mapping is fetched from the file
<b>.NTFS-3G/UserMapping</b> located in the NTFS partition.
The option <b>usermapping=</b> may be used to define another
location. When the option permissions is set and no mapping
file is found, a default mapping is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line in
the user mapping file defines a mapping. It is organized in
three fields separated by colons. The first field identifies
a <b>uid</b>, the second field identifies a <b>gid</b> and
the third one identifies the corresponding NTFS id, known as
a <b>SID</b>. The <b>uid</b> and the <b>gid</b> are optional
and defining both of them for the same <b>SID</b> is not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
interoperation with Windows is needed, you can use the
option <b>permissions</b> to define a standard mapping.
Alternately, you may define your own mapping by setting a
single default mapping with no uid and gid. In both cases,
files created on Linux will appear to Windows as owned by a
foreign user, and files created on Windows will appear to
Linux as owned by root. Just copy the example below and
replace the 9 and 10-digit numbers by any number not greater
than 4294967295. The resulting behavior is the same as the
one with the option permission set with no ownership option
and no user mapping file available.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-10000</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a strong
interoperation with Windows is needed, the mapping has to be
defined for each user and group known in both system, and
the <b>SID</b>s used by Windows has to be collected. This
will lead to a user mapping file like :</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>john::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-1008

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The utility
<b>ntfs-3g.usermap</b> may be used to create such a user
mapping file.</p>
