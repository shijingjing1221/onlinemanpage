<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
is used to take base backups of a running PostgreSQL
database cluster. These are taken without affecting other
clients to the database, and can be used both for
point&minus;in&minus;time recovery (see Section 24.3,
&ldquo;Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery
(PITR)&rdquo;, in the documentation) and as the starting
point for a log shipping or streaming replication standby
servers (see Section 25.2, &ldquo;Log-Shipping Standby
Servers&rdquo;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
makes a binary copy of the database cluster files, while
making sure the system is put in and out of backup mode
automatically. Backups are always taken of the entire
database cluster; it is not possible to back up individual
databases or database objects. For individual database
backups, a tool such as <b>pg_dump</b>(1) must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The backup is
made over a regular PostgreSQL connection, and uses the
replication protocol. The connection must be made with a
superuser or a user having REPLICATION permissions (see
Section 20.2, &ldquo;Role Attributes&rdquo;, in the
documentation), and pg_hba.conf must explicitly permit the
replication connection. The server must also be configured
with max_wal_senders set high enough to leave at least one
session available for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There can be
multiple <b>pg_basebackup</b>s running at the same time, but
it is better from a performance point of view to take only
one backup, and copy the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
can make a base backup from not only the master but also the
standby. To take a backup from the standby, set up the
standby so that it can accept replication connections (that
is, set <i>max_wal_senders</i> and hot_standby, and
configure host&minus;based authentication). You will also
need to enable full_page_writes on the master.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are some limitations in an online backup from the
standby:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
backup history file is not created in the database cluster
backed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; There is
no guarantee that all WAL files required for the backup are
archived at the end of backup. If you are planning to use
the backup for an archive recovery and want to ensure that
all required files are available at that moment, you need to
include them into the backup by using &minus;x option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If the
standby is promoted to the master during online backup, the
backup fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; All WAL
records required for the backup must contain sufficient
full&minus;page writes, which requires you to enable
<i>full_page_writes</i> on the master and not to use a tool
like pg_compresslog as <i>archive_command</i> to remove
full&minus;page writes from WAL files.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command&minus;line options control the location and format
of the output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;D</b>
<i>directory</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;pgdata=</b><i>directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Directory to write the output
to. pg_basebackup will create the directory and any parent
directories if necessary. The directory may already exist,
but it is an error if the directory already exists and is
not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the backup
is in tar mode, and the directory is specified as &minus;
(dash), the tar file will be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
required.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;F</b>
<i>format</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;format=</b><i>format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Selects the format for the
output. <i>format</i> can be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">p, plain</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Write the output as plain
files, with the same layout as the current data directory
and tablespaces. When the cluster has no additional
tablespaces, the whole database will be placed in the target
directory. If the cluster contains additional tablespaces,
the main data directory will be placed in the target
directory, but all other tablespaces will be placed in the
same absolute path as they have on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
default format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">t, tar</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Write the output as tar files
in the target directory. The main data directory will be
written to a file named base.tar, and all other tablespaces
will be named after the tablespace OID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If the value
&minus; (dash) is specified as target directory, the tar
contents will be written to standard output, suitable for
piping to for example gzip. This is only possible if the
cluster has no additional tablespaces.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;x</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;xlog</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Using this option is equivalent
of using &minus;X with method fetch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;X</b>
<i>method</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;xlog&minus;method=</b><i>method</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Includes the required
transaction log files (WAL files) in the backup. This will
include all transaction logs generated during the backup. If
this option is specified, it is possible to start a
postmaster directly in the extracted directory without the
need to consult the log archive, thus making this a
completely standalone backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
methods for collecting the transaction logs are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">f, fetch</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The transaction log files are
collected at the end of the backup. Therefore, it is
necessary for the wal_keep_segments parameter to be set high
enough that the log is not removed before the end of the
backup. If the log has been rotated when it's time to
transfer it, the backup will fail and be unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">s, stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Stream the transaction log
while the backup is created. This will open a second
connection to the server and start streaming the transaction
log in parallel while running the backup. Therefore, it will
use up two slots configured by the max_wal_senders
parameter. As long as the client can keep up with
transaction log received, using this mode requires no extra
transaction logs to be saved on the master.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;z</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;gzip</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables gzip compression of tar
file output, with the default compression level. Compression
is only available when using the tar format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;Z</b>
<i>level</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;compress=</b><i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables gzip compression of tar
file output, and specifies the compression level (1 through
9, 9 being best compression). Compression is only available
when using the tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command&minus;line options control the generation of the
backup and the running of the program.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;c</b>
<i>fast|spread</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;checkpoint=</b><i>fast|spread</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets checkpoint mode to fast or
spread (default).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;l</b>
<i>label</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;label=</b><i>label</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the label for the backup.
If none is specified, a default value of
&ldquo;pg_basebackup base backup&rdquo; will be used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;P</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables progress reporting.
Turning this on will deliver an approximate progress report
during the backup. Since the database may change during the
backup, this is only an approximation and may not end at
exactly 100%. In particular, when WAL log is included in the
backup, the total amount of data cannot be estimated in
advance, and in this case the estimated target size will
increase once it passes the total estimate without WAL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When this is
enabled, the backup will start by enumerating the size of
the entire database, and then go back and send the actual
contents. This may make the backup take slightly longer, and
in particular it will take longer before the first data is
sent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables verbose mode. Will
output some extra steps during startup and shutdown, as well
as show the exact file name that is currently being
processed if progress reporting is also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command&minus;line options control the database connection
parameters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;h</b>
<i>host</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;host=</b><i>host</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the host name of the
machine on which the server is running. If the value begins
with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix
domain socket. The default is taken from the <b>PGHOST</b>
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket
connection is attempted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;p</b>
<i>port</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;port=</b><i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the TCP port or local
Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is
listening for connections. Defaults to the <b>PGPORT</b>
environment variable, if set, or a compiled&minus;in
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>interval</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;status&minus;interval=</b><i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the number of seconds
between status packets sent back to the server. This is
required when streaming the transaction log (using
&minus;&minus;xlog=stream) if replication timeout is
configured on the server, and allows for easier monitoring.
A value of zero disables the status updates completely. The
default value is 10 seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;U</b>
<i>username</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;username=</b><i>username</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">User name to connect as.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;w</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Never issue a password prompt.
If the server requires password authentication and a
password is not available by other means such as a .pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be
useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to
enter a password.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;W</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force pg_basebackup to prompt
for a password before connecting to a database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
never essential, since pg_basebackup will automatically
prompt for a password if the server demands password
authentication. However, pg_basebackup will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing <b>&minus;W</b>
to avoid the extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other options
are also available:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;V</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the pg_basebackup version
and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;?</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show help about pg_basebackup
command line arguments, and exit.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility,
like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the environment
variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.14,
&ldquo;Environment Variables&rdquo;, in the
documentation).</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The backup will
include all files in the data directory and tablespaces,
including the configuration files and any additional files
placed in the directory by third parties. Only regular files
and directories are allowed in the data directory, no
symbolic links or special device files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way
PostgreSQL manages tablespaces, the path for all additional
tablespaces must be identical whenever a backup is restored.
The main data directory, however, is relocatable to any
location.</p>
