<h2>KNOWN PROBLEMS
<a name="KNOWN PROBLEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
are not bugs in Date::Manip, but they may give some people
problems. <b><br>
Memory leak</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There is a known memory leak in
perl related to named regexp captures that directly affects
Date::Manip . The leak is in all versions of perl up to the
following versions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   5.10.1
   5.12.5
   5.14.3
   5.15.5</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The bug has
been fixed in:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   5.15.6
   5.16.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a
maintenance release is done for any of the other releases
(5.10, 5.12, 5.14), that includes the patch, I&rsquo;ll
update this section to include that information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
5.xx is not susceptible, so using it may be a feasible
workaround, but if you need accurate timezone handling, this
isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Simple tests
estimate the leak to be about 3 <small>MB</small> per 10,000
dates parsed, so unless you&rsquo;re parsing hundreds of
thousands, or millions of dates, the leak probably
won&rsquo;t be a problem on systems with moderate amounts of
memory. And if you&rsquo;re parsing that many dates, the
relatively slow Date::Manip may not be the correct module
for you to use anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Unable to determine Time
Zone</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Please refer to the
Date::Manip::TZ documentation for a discussion of this
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Dmake error on strawberry
perl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Users of Strawberry perl on
windows may encounter an error similar to the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   dmake: makefile: line 3016: Error: &minus;&minus; Input line too long, increase MAXLINELENGTH</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is a known
problem with some versions of strawberry perl, and I
can&rsquo;t fix it in Date::Manip. If you encounter this
problem, you can install the package manually using the
commands:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   c:&gt; cpan
   cpan&gt; look Date::Manip::Date
   &gt; perl Makefile.PL
   &gt; dmake MAXLINELENGTH=300000 make
   &gt; dmake MAXLINELENGTH=300000 make test
   &gt; dmake MAXLINELENGTH=300000 make install</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can find
more details here:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.win32.vanilla/2011/02/msg287.html</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Calculations appear to be
off by an hour</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Due to daylight saving time
(specifically, the spring change where the time typically
moves forward from 02:00 to 03:00, any date calculation
which would intuitively report a time in that range will
also move forward (or backward as the case may be).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">*NOTE* This
should be less of a problem since 6.30 with the addition of
semi-exact deltas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Missing date formats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Due to the large number of date
formats that Date::Manip <small>CAN</small> process, people
often assume that other formats that they want to use should
work as well, and when they don&rsquo;t, it comes as a
surprise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With the much
improved parsing of 6.00, many formats can be added easily,
though unless they are of general use, I&rsquo;ll probably
suggest that you use parse_format instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
class of formats that I do not plan to add however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I have
frequently been asked to add formats such as &quot;the 15th
of last month&quot;, or &quot;Monday of next week&quot;. I
do not intend to add these date formats to Date::Manip, but
since I have received the request several times, I decided
to include my reasoning here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip can
parse pretty much any static date format that I could think
of or find reference to. Dates such as &quot;today&quot;,
&quot;Jan 12&quot;, or &quot;2001&minus;01&minus;01&quot;
are all understood.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These are
fairly limited however. Many very common date formats are
best thought of as a date plus a modification. For example,
&quot;yesterday&quot; is actually determined internally as
&quot;today&quot; plus a modification of &quot;&minus; 1
day&quot;. &quot;2nd Sunday in June&quot; is determined as
&quot;June 1&quot; modified to the 2nd Sunday.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As these types
of formats were added over time, I quickly realized that the
number of possible date plus modification formats was huge.
The number of combinations has caused the parsing in
Date::Manip to be quite complex, and adding new formats
occasionally causes unexpected conflicts with other
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The first time
I received a request similar to &quot;the 15th of last
month&quot;, I intended to add it, but as I analyzed it to
see what changes needed to be made to support it, I realized
that this needed to be expressed as a date plus
<small>TWO</small> modifications. In other words, today
modified to last month modified to the 15th day of the
month.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As bad as date
plus modification formats are, a date plus
<small>TWO</small> modifications would be exponentially
worse. On realizing that, I decided that Date::Manip will
not support this type of format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Although I
apologize for the inconvenience, I do not intend to change
my position on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date::Manip is slow</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>NOTE:</small> The
following section applies primarily to 5.xx. I&rsquo;m doing
a lot of work to optimize Date::Manip and I will rewrite
this section to take this into account, and to provide
performance suggestions. It should be noted that initial
tests show version 6.xx to be around twice as fast as 5.xx
(though still considerably slower than some of the other
modules).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip is
probably one of the slower Date/Time modules due to the fact
that it is huge and written entirely in perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some things
that will definitely help:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>ISO&minus;8601</small>
dates are parsed first and fastest. Use them whenever
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Avoid parsing
dates that are referenced against the current time (in 2
days, today at noon, etc.). These take a lot longer to
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Business date
calculations are extremely slow. You should consider
alternatives if possible (i.e. doing the calculation in
exact mode and then multiplying by 5/7). Who needs a
business date more accurate than &quot;6 to 8 weeks&quot;
anyway, right :&minus;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Using functions/methods
which are not supported</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There have been a handful of
incidents of people using a function from Date::Manip which
were not documented in the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
consists of a large number of user functions which are
documented in the manual. These are designed to be used by
other programmers, and I will not make any backwards
incompatible changes in them unless there is a very
compelling reason to do so, and in that case, the change
will be clearly documented in the Date::Manip::Changes6
documentation for this module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
also includes a large number of functions which are
<small>NOT</small> documented. These are for internal use
only. Please do not use them! I can (and do) change their
use, and even their name, without notice, and without
apology! Some of these internal functions even have test
scripts, but that is not a guarantee that they will not
change, nor is any support implied. I simply like to run
regression tests on as much of Date::Manip as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of the most
recent versions of Date::Manip, all internal functions have
names that begin with an underscore (_). If you choose to
use them directly, it is quite possible that new versions of
Date::Manip will cause your programs to break due to a
change in how those functions work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any changes to
internal functions will not be documented, and will not be
regarded by me as a backwards incompatibility. Nor will I
(as was requested in one instance) revert to a previous
version of the internal function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you feel
that an internal function is of more general use, feel free
to contact me with an argument of why it should be
&quot;promoted&quot;. I welcome suggestions and will
definitely consider any such request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>RCS</small>
Control</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you try to put Date::Manip
under <small>RCS</small> control, you are going to have
problems. Apparently, <small>RCS</small> replaces strings of
the form &quot;$Date...$&quot; with the current date. This
form occurs all over in Date::Manip. To prevent the
<small>RCS</small> keyword expansion, checkout files
using:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   co &minus;ko</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since very few
people will ever have a desire to do this (and I don&rsquo;t
use <small>RCS</small> ), I have not worried about it, and I
do not intend to try to workaround this problem.</p>

<h2>KNOWN COMPLAINTS
<a name="KNOWN COMPLAINTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
6.xx has gotten some complaints (far more than 5.xx if the
truth be told), so I&rsquo;d like to address a couple of
them here. Perhaps an understanding of why some of the
changes were made will allay some of the complaints. If not,
people are always welcome to stick with the 5.xx release. I
will continue to support the 5.xx releases for a couple
years (though I do <small>NOT</small> plan to add
functionality to it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
complaints come both from both the <small>CPAN</small>
ratings site:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Date&minus;Manip</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and from
personal email. <b><br>
Requires perl 5.10</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The single most controversial
change made in 6.00 is that it now required perl 5.10.0 or
higher. Most of the negative feedback I&rsquo;ve received is
due to this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the past,
I&rsquo;ve avoided using new features of perl in order to
allow Date::Manip to run on older versions of perl. Prior to
perl 5.10, none of the new features would have had a major
impact on how Date::Manip was written so this practice was
justified. That all changed with the release of perl
5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
aspects of Date::Manip that has received the most positive
response is the ability to parse almost every conceivable
date format. Unfortunately, as I&rsquo;ve added formats, the
parsing routine became more and more complicated, and
maintaining it was one of the least enjoyable aspect in
maintaining Date::Manip . In fact, for several years
I&rsquo;ve been extremely reluctant to add new formats due
to the fact that too often, adding a new format broke other
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As I was
rewriting Date::Manip, I was looking for ways to improve the
parsing and to make maintaining it easier. Perl 5.10
provides the feature &quot;named capture buffers&quot;.
Named capture buffers not only improves the ease of
maintaining the complex regular expressions used by
Date::Manip, it makes it dramatically easier to add
additional formats in a way that is much less likely to
interfere with other formats. The parsing in 6.00 is so much
more robust, extensible, and flexible, that it will make
parser maintenance possible for many years to come at a
fraction of the effort and risk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It was too much
to turn down. Hopefully, since 5.10 has been out for some
time now, this will not prohibit too many people from using
the new version of Date::Manip. I realize that there are
many people out there using older versions of perl who do
not have the option of upgrading perl. The decision to use
5.10 wasn&rsquo;t made lightly... but I don&rsquo;t regret
making it. I apologize to users who, as a result, cannot use
6.00 . Hopefully in the future you&rsquo;ll be able to
benefit from the improvements in 6.00.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One complaint
I&rsquo;ve received is that this in some way makes
Date::Manip backwards incompatible, but this is not an
accurate complaint. Version 6.xx <small>DOES</small> include
some backwards incompatibilities (and these are covered in
the Date::Manip::Migration5to6 document), however in almost
all cases, these incompatibilities are with infrequently
used features, or workarounds are in place to allow
deprecated features to continue functioning for some period
of time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Though I have
no data to confirm this, I suspect that 90% or more of all
scripts which were written with Date::Manip 5.xx will
continue to work unmodified with 6.xx (of course, you should
still refer to the migration document to see what features
are deprecated or changed to make sure that you don&rsquo;t
need to modify your script so that it will continue to work
in the future). Even with scripts that need to be changed,
the changes should be trivial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So, Date::Manip
6.xx is almost entirely backward compatible with 5.xx (to
the extent that you would expect any major version release
to be compatible with a previous major version).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The change is
only in the requirements necessary to get Date::Manip 6.xx
to run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously,
it&rsquo;s not reasonable to say that Date::Manip should
never be allowed to switch minimum perl versions. At some
point, you have to let go of an old version if you want to
make use of the features of the newer version. The question
is, did I jump to 5.10 too fast?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The negative
ratings I see in the <small>CPAN</small> ratings complain
that I no longer support perl 5.6 and perl 5.8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With respect to
5.6, perl 5.6 was released in March of 2000 (that&rsquo;s
before Windows <small>XP</small> which was released in
2001). To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really feel much sympathy
for this complaint. Software that is 9 years old is
<small>ANCIENT.</small> People may choose to use it... but
please don&rsquo;t complain when new software comes out that
doesn&rsquo;t support it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
for perl 5.8 is much more compelling. Although 5.8 was
released quite some time ago (July of 2002), there were no
major perl releases until 5.10 came out in December of 2007,
so 5.8 was state-of-the art as little as 2 years prior to
the release of Date::Manip 6.xx.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I agree
completely with the argument that abandoning 5.8 only 2
years after it was the current version is too soon. For that
reason, I will continue to support the Date::Manip 5.xx
releases for some years to come. I don&rsquo;t know exactly
how long I&rsquo;ll continue to support them, but
it&rsquo;ll be at least 2&minus;3 years. Once perl 5.10 is 5
years old, I&rsquo;ll be much more likely to drop support
for the 5.xx releases, but I <small>DO</small> want to make
use of the features of 5.10 for future development. They
make development so much easier, and the parsing so much
more robust (something I&rsquo;ve wanted for years), that
I&rsquo;m not willing to give up the advantages of 5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But the next
complaint is relevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Automatic installs
break</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A much more important problem
is that versions 6.00 through 6.07 broke automatic installs
for older perl installations. If you try to install
Date::Manip using the automatic tools (cpan/cpanp), they
will look for the most recent version. If you are using a
version of perl older than 5.10, this fails, and rather than
looking for an older version, the tool simply reports a
failure in installing Date::Manip. Technically, the problem
is not due to Date::Manip itself, but is a result of how
perl modules are currently managed. However, since
Date::Manip is managed by then, it&rsquo;s important to
avoid causing this type of problem (which I clearly failed
to do).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of
Date::Manip 6.10, this problem should no longer occur.
Starting with version 6.10, both the 5.xx and 6.xx versions
of Date::Manip have been combined into a single distribution
(so Date&minus;Manip&minus;6.10 contained both Date::Manip
6.10 and Date::Manip 5.57). From Date::Manip 6.10 to 6.13,
the perl version was determined at install time and either
the 5.xx or 6.xx version was installed. From Date::Manip
6.14 on, both versions are installed, and at run time, the
correct version will be chosen (and if you&rsquo;re running
a recent version of perl, you can select to run the old or
new version).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All future
version (for as long as 5.xx is supported) will include both
the most current 5.xx and 6.xx releases of Date::Manip. In
this way, automatic install tools will be able to install
Date::Manip regardless of which version of perl you are
running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Too many modules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One minor complaint is that
there are too many files. One person specifically objects to
the fact that there are over 470 modules covering non-minute
offsets. This complaint is ( <small>IMO</small> ) silly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
supports <small>ALL</small> historical time zones, including
those with non-minute offsets, and so there will be
information for those time zones, even though they are not
currently in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I could of
course store all of the information in one big module, but
that means that you have to load all of that data every time
you use Date::Manip, and I find that to be a very poor
solution. Instead, storing the information in a per-time
zone and per-offset manner dramatically decreases the amount
of data that has to be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">While it is
true that Date::Manip includes over 900 modules for all of
the time zone information, most implementations of time zone
handling also choose to break up the data into a large
number of files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">My linux
distribution (openSuSE 11.2 at the time of writing this)
uses the standard zoneinfo database, and at this point,
there are over 1700 files included in /usr/share/zoneinfo
(though it does appear that there is some duplication of
information). Current versions of RedHat also use over 1700
files, so Date::Manip isn&rsquo;t treating the time zone
data in a new or unreasonable way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Objects are large</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One complaint that was put on
the <small>CPAN</small> ratings site was that the
<small>OO</small> interface is &quot;a dud&quot; due to the
size of it&rsquo;s objects. The complaint is that a
Date::Manip::Date object is 115K while it should (according
to the complaint) only require that you need to save the
seconds from the epoch, zone, and a couple other pieces of
information, all of which could probably be stored in 100
bytes or less.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This complaint
is not accurate, and comes from a misunderstanding of how
Date::Manip objects are created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip is
very configurable, and contains a great deal of information
which could theoretically be calculated on the fly, but
which would greatly reduce it&rsquo;s performance. Instead,
in the interest of improving performance, the data is
cached, and since the data is virtually all potentially
object specific, it has to be somehow linked to the
object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
Date::Manip allows you to parse dates in several languages.
Each language has a large number of regular expressions
which are used to do the actual parsing. Instead of
recreating these regular expressions each time they are
needed, they are created once and stored in an object
(specifically, a Date::Manip::Base object). The size of the
Date::Manip::Base object is almost 15K (due primarily to the
regular expressions used in parsing dates in the selected
language).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a
description of the time zones are stored in a second object
(a Date::Manip::TZ object). The size of the Date::Manip::TZ
object starts at 100K. That may seem excessive, but you have
to remember that there are almost 500 time zones, and they
have to be indexed by name, alias, abbreviation, and offset,
and by the time you do this, it does take a fair bit of
space. It should also be noted that the full description of
each timezone is only stored in the object when the timezone
is actually used, so if you use a lot of timezones, this
object will grow slowly as new timezones are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The size of the
actual Date::Manip::Date object is a little over 300 bytes.
However, each includes a pointer to a Date::Manip::Base and
a Date::Manip::TZ object (and due to how the object was
being looked at in the complaint, they were reporting the
size of all three objects, <small>NOT</small> just the
Date::Manip::Date object).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Both the
Date::Manip::Base and Date::Manip::TZ objects are reused by
any number of Date::Manip::Date objects. They can almost be
thought of as global data, except that they are accessible
in the standard <small>OO</small> manner, and you are
allowed to modify them on a per-object basis which
<small>WILL</small> mean that you have to store more data.
If you work with multiple configurations (see
Date::Manip::Config), you&rsquo;ll need multiple Base and
<small>TZ</small> objects. However, most of the time you
will not need to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The actual
Date::Manip::Date object is a bit larger than suggested in
the complaint, but it should be noted that Date::Manip
actually stores the dates in a number of different formats
(a string of the form <small>YYYYMMDDHH:MN:SS</small> and a
list [ <small>YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MN,SS</small> ] in the time zone
it was parsed in, the local time zone (if different) and
<small>GMT.</small> By caching this information as it is
used, it has a huge impact on the performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So, Date::Manip
in typical usage consists of one 100K Date::Manip::TZ
object, one 15K Date::Manip::Base objects, and any number of
small 300 byte Date::Manip::Date objects. Date::Manip::Delta
objects are even smaller. Date::Manip::Recur objects are
also small, but they contain any number of Date objects in
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I am certainly
open to suggestions as to how I can improve the
<small>OO</small> interface... but I don&rsquo;t believe it
is a dud. While I&rsquo;m not an expert at <small>OO</small>
programming, I believe that I followed pretty standard and
accepted procedures for accessing the data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date::Manip has an
inconsistent interface</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">I&rsquo;ve gotten a few
complaints that the interface to Date::Manip is
inconsistent... and I agree (at least when using the
functional interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip was
originally written in an unplanned way... as a need/want
came up, it was extended. That&rsquo;s not the way to write
a major package of course, but it wasn&rsquo;t expected to
be a major package at the start.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As it became
more and more widely used, I too wished for a more
consistent interface, but I did not want to break backward
compatibility for everyone using it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When 6.xx was
written, I spent a good deal of time trying to make a very
standard <small>OO</small> interface, so I do not believe
that this complaint can be applied to the <small>OO</small>
interface (though I&rsquo;m interested in suggestions for
improving it of course).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As far as the
functional interface goes, I&rsquo;ll continue to support it
in a backward compatible (and therefore inconsistent) form.
I&rsquo;d encourage the use of the <small>OO</small>
interface whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please do not
use other means to report bugs (such as Usenet newsgroups,
or forums for a specific <small>OS</small> or Linux
distribution) as it is impossible for me to keep up with all
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When filing a
bug report, please include the following information:
<b><br>
Date::Manip version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Please include the version of
Date::Manip you are using. You can get this by using the
script:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   use Date::Manip;
   print DateManipVersion(1),&quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   use Date::Manip::Date;
   $obj = new Date::Manip::Date;
   print $obj&minus;&gt;version(1),&quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Perl information</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Please include the output from
&quot;perl &minus;V&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
problem using Date::Manip that perhaps isn&rsquo;t a bug
(can&rsquo;t figure out the syntax, etc.), you&rsquo;re in
the right place. Start by reading the main Date::Manip
documentation, and the other documents that apply to
whatever you are trying to do. If this still doesn&rsquo;t
answer your question, mail me directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I would ask
that you be reasonably familiar with the documentation
<small>BEFORE</small> you choose to do this. Date::Manip is
a hobby, and I simply do not have time to respond to
hundreds of questions which are already answered in this
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find any
problems with the documentation (errors, typos, or items
that are not clear), please send them to me. I welcome any
suggestions that will allow me to improve the
documentation.</p>
