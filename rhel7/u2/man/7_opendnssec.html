<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenDNSSEC is a
complete DNSSEC zone signing system which maintains
stability and security of signed domains. DNSSEC adds many
cryptographic concerns to DNS; OpenDNSSEC automates those to
allow current DNS administrators to adopt DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Domain signing
is done by placing OpenDNSSEC between the place where the
zone files are edited and where they are published. The
current version of OpenDNSSEC supports files and AXFR to
communicate the zone data; effectively, OpenDNSSEC acts as a
&quot;bump in the wire&quot; between editing and publishing
a zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenDNSSEC has
two daemons, which are unitedly started and stopped through
the <i>ods&minus;control(8)</i> command. The two daemons in
turn invoke other programs to get their work done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
daemons is the KASP Enforcer, which enforces policies that
define security and timing requirements for each individual
zone. Operators tend to interact with the KASP Enforcer a
lot, through the <i>ods&minus;ksmutil(1)</i> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The other
daemon is the Signer Engine, which in turn signs the zone
content. It retrieves that content from a file or through
AXFR, and publishes a signed version of the zone into a file
or through AXFR. Direct interaction with the Signer Engine,
although not normally necessary, is possible through the
<i>ods&minus;signer(8)</i> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The keys that
sign the zones are managed by an independent repository,
which is accessed over a PKCS #11 interface. The principle
idea of this interface being to unleash access to
cryptographic hardware, there are implementations in
software. Also, implementations range from open to
commercial, and from very simple to highly secure. By
default, OpenDNSSEC is configured to run on top of a
SoftHSM, but a few other commands exist to test any Hardware
Security Module that may sit under the PKCS #11 API.</p>

<h2>OPERATIONAL PRACTICES
<a name="OPERATIONAL PRACTICES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The approach
used by OpenDNSSEC follows the best current practice of two
kinds of key per zone: <b><br>
KSK</b> or <b>Key Signing Key</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This key belongs in the apex of
a zone, and is referenced in the parent zone (quite possibly
a registry) in the form of DS records alongside NS records.
These parent references function as trust delegations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The KSK is
usually a longer key, and it could harm the efficiency of
secure resolvers if all individual resource records were
signed with it. This is why it is advisable to use the KSK
only to sign the ZSK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In DNS records,
the KSK can usually be recognised by having its SEP (Secure
Entry Point) flag set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ZSK</b> or <b>Zone Signing
Key</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This key also belongs in the
apex of a zone, and is actually used to sign the resource
records in a zone. It is a shorter key for reasons of
efficiency, that is rolled over on a fairly regular basis.
To detach these rollovers from the parent, the ZSK is not
directly trusted by the parent zone, but instead its trust
is established by way of a signature by the KSK on the
ZSK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenDNSSEC is
mindful about the period of validity of each key, and will
rollover in time to keep the domain signed, with new keys,
without any downtime for the secure domain. The only thing
that is not standardised, and thus cannot be automated at
the moment is the interface between a zone and its parent,
so this has to be done manually, or scripted around
OpenDNSSEC.</p>
