<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip::Changes5to6
&minus; describes differences between 5.xx and 6.00</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
6.00 represents a complete rethink and rewrite of
Date::Manip. A great deal of effort was made to make sure
that 6.00 is almost backwards compatible with 5.xx whenever
feasible, but some functionality has changed in backwards
incompatible ways. Other parts have been deprecated and will
be removed at some point in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the differences between the 5.xx series and
version 6.00. This page primarily describes technical
details, most of which do not impact how Date::Manip is used
in scripts. If you want to make sure that a script which ran
with 5.xx will run with 6.xx, refer to the
Date::Manip::Migration5to6 document.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Date::Manip
5.xx series of suffered from several weaknesses. These
included: <b><br>
Poor time zone support</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Time zone support in 5.xx was
broken. Determining a time zone, and understanding daylight
saving time changes was incomplete (at best) and totally
inadequate to do true timezone operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Parsing too complicated and
unstructured</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The parsing routines had grown
very complicated, and overly permissive over time and were
in need of a complete overhaul.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Lacking <small>OO</small>
model</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip 5.xx was written as
a functional module, not an <small>OO</small> module, but
date handling would lend itself very well to being
<small>OO</small> with different classes to handle dates,
deltas, and recurrences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>OO</small> model allows a lot of information to be
stored with each date (such as time zone information) which
is discarded in the functional interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Too monolithic</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The entire Date::Manip module
was contained in one huge file. Breaking up the module would
make it much easier to deal with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
6.00 is a complete rewrite of Date::Manip to address these
and other issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sections address how Date::Manip 6.00 differs from previous
releases, and describes changes that might need to be made
to your script in order to upgrade from 5.xx to 6.00.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most
important changes are marked with asterisks.</p>

<h2>GENERAL CHANGES
<a name="GENERAL CHANGES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(*) Requires
perl 5.10.0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Please see the
Date::Manip::Problems document for a discussion of this
problem. It&rsquo;s in the <small>KNOWN COMPLAINTS</small>
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Breaking into smaller
modules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip module has been
broken up from one huge module into a large number of
smaller more manageable modules. The main Date::Manip module
is still present, and contains all of the functions from
Date::Manip 5.xx (except that they now call functions from
all the other modules to do the actual work). In general,
the Date::Manip module from 6.00 is backwards
compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A number of new
modules have been created as well. These can be used
directly, bypassing the main Date::Manip module. These
include the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip::Base
contains many basic date operations which may be used to do
simple date manipulation tasks without all the overhead of
the full Date::Manip module.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip::TZ
contains time zone operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Handling dates,
deltas, and recurrences are now done in Date::Manip::Date,
Date::Manip::Delta, and Date::Manip::Recur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
modules are object oriented, and are designed to be used
directly, so if you prefer an <small>OO</small> interface
over a functional interface, use these modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Intermediate data
cached</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In order to improve the
performance of Date::Manip, many intermediate values are
cached. This does impact the memory footprint of the module,
but it has a huge impact on the performance of the
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some types of
data depend on the config variables used, and these are
cached separately, and this cache is automatically cleared
every time a config variable is set. As a result, it is best
if you set all config variables at the start, and then leave
them alone completely to get optimal use of cached data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A side effect
of all this is that the Memoize module should not be used in
conjunction with Date::Manip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the version
5.xx documentation, it was mentioned that the Memoize module
might be used to improve performance in some cases. This is
no longer the case. It should not be used with Date::Manip,
even if you use the functional interface instead of the
<small>OO</small> interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Taint safe</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip now contains no
tainted data, and should run without problems with taint
checking on provided you do not set additional methods for
determining the system time zone using the curr_zone_methods
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Ideally, this
should never be necessary. If it is necessary, I&rsquo;d
like to hear about it so that I can add whatever standard
methods are needed to the built in list.</p>

<h2>TIME ZONE SUPPORT
<a name="TIME ZONE SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(*) Complete
handling of time zones</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The biggest problem with
Date::Manip 5.xx was it&rsquo;s inability to correctly
handle time zones and Daylight Saving Time. That is now
fixed. Version 6.00 includes support for every time zone
included in the zoneinfo (aka Olson) database which includes
the definitions of (hopefully) all of the time zones used in
the world.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Individual time zones will
no longer be added</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prior to 5.55, time zones were
added upon request. Since 6.00 now supports a full set of
standard time zones, I will no longer add in individual time
zones (Date::Manip::TZ includes functionality for adding
them yourself if they are needed). With Date::Manip now
having full time zone support, I&rsquo;m not interested in
supporting my own time zone database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, I am
interested in adding sets of time zones from various
&quot;standards&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
6.00 includes time zones from the following standards:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Olson zoneinfo database
   all Microsoft Windows time zones
   zones listed in RFC&minus;822</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
additional standards that include additional time zones not
included here, please point me to them so they can be added.
This could include published lists of time zone names
supported on some operating system which have different
names than the zoneinfo list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Nonstandard time zone
abbreviations removed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some of the individual
standards that were added in the 5.xx series are not
included in any of the standards listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of 6.00,
only time zones from standards will be included in the
distribution (others can be added by users using the
functions described in Date::Manip::TZ to add aliases for
existing time zones).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
time zones were in Date::Manip 5.xx but not in 6.00.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   IDLW    &minus;1200    International Date Line West

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>A lot of support modules and
files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip now includes a
large number of files and modules that are used to support
time zones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A series of
modules are included which are auto-generated from the
zoneinfo database. The Date::Manip::Zones,
Date::Manip::TZ::*, and Date::Manip::Offset::* modules are
all automatically generated and are not intended to be used
directly. Instead, the Date::Manip::TZ module is used to
access the data stored there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A separate time
zone module (Date::Manip::TZ::*) is included for every
single time zone. There is also a module
(Date::Manip::Offset::*) for every different offset. All
told, there are almost 1000 modules. These are included to
make time zone handling more efficient. Rather than
calculating everything on the fly, information about each
time zone and offset are included here which greatly speeds
up the handling of time zones. These modules are only loaded
as needed (i.e. only the modules related to the specific
time zones you refer to are ever loaded), so there is no
performance penalty to having them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also included
in the distribution are a script (tzdata) and additional
module (Date::Manip::TZdata). These are used to
automatically generate the time zone modules, and are of no
use to anyone other than the maintainer of Date::Manip. They
are included solely for the sake of completeness. If someone
wanted to fork Date::Manip, all the tools necessary to do so
are included in the distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Meaning of $::TZ and</b>
<b><i>$ENV</i></b><b>{ <small>TZ</small> }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.x, you could
specify what time zone you wanted to work in using either
the <tt>$::TZ</tt> or <tt>$ENV</tt>{ <small>TZ</small> }
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
6.00 makes use of two different time zones: the actual local
time zone the computer is running in (and which is used by
the system clock), and a time zone that you want to work in.
Typically, these are the same, but they do not have to
be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of
Date::Manip 6.00, the <tt>$::TZ</tt> and <tt>$ENV</tt>{
<small>TZ</small> } variables are used only to specify the
actual local time zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
specify an alternate time zone to work in, use the SetDate
or ForceDate config variables.</p>

<h2>CONFIG FILES AND VARIABLES
<a name="CONFIG FILES AND VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(*)
Date_Init handling of config variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The handling of config
variables has changed slightly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Previously,
variables passed in to Date_Init overrode values from config
files. This has changed slightly. Options to Date_Init are
now parsed in the order they are listed, so the
following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Date_Init(&quot;DateFormat=Other&quot;,&quot;ConfigFile=DateManip.cnf&quot;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">would first set
the DateFormat variable, and then it would read the config
file &quot;DateManip.cnf&quot;. If that config file included
a DateFormat definition, it would override the one passed in
to Date_Init.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The proper way
to override config files is to pass the config files in
first, followed by any script-specific overrides. In other
words:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Date_Init(&quot;ConfigFile=DateManip.cnf&quot;,&quot;DateFormat=Other&quot;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date_Init doesn&rsquo;t
return the config variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip::5.xx, Date_Init
could return the list of all config variables. This
functionality is no longer supported. Date_Init is used
strictly to set config variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Config file
options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip 5.xx had the
concept of a global and personal config file. In addition,
the personal config file could be looked for in a path of
directories. All this was specified using the config
variables:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   GlobalCnf
   IgnoreGlobalCnf
   PersonalCnf
   PersonalCnfPath
   PathSep</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
have been removed. Instead, the single config variable:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   ConfigFile</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will be used to
specify config files (with no distinction between a global
and personal config file). Also, no path searching is done.
Each must be specified by a complete path. Finally, any
number of config files can be used. So the following is
valid:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Date_Init(&quot;ConfigFile=./Manip.cnf&quot;,&quot;ConfigFile=/tmp/Manip.cnf&quot;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Other config variables
removed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The following config variables
have been removed.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   TodayIsMidnight  Use DefaultTime instead.
   ConvTZ           Use SetDate or ForceDate instead.
   Internal         Use Printable instead.
   DeltaSigns       Use the Date::Manip::Delta::printf
                    method to print deltas
   UpdateCurrTZ     With real time zone handling in
                    place, this is no longer necessary</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Other config variables
deprecated</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The following config variables
are deprecated and will be removed in some future
version:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   TZ              Use SetDate or ForceDate instead.
   IntCharSet      This has been replaced with better support for
                   international character sets. The Encoding config
                   variable may be used instead.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Holidays</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously, holidays could be
defined as a &quot;Date + Delta&quot; or &quot;Date &minus;
Delta&quot; string. These predate recurrences, and introduce
some complexity into the handling of holidays. Since
recurrences are a much better way to define holidays, the
&quot;Date + Delta&quot; and &quot;Date &minus; Delta&quot;
strings are no longer supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>TZ</small> replaced
(and enhanced)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The SetDate and ForceDate
variables (which include the functionality of the deprecated
<small>TZ</small> variable) are much improved as described
in the Date::Manip::Config documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since it is now
handles time change correctly (allowing time changes to
occur in the alternate time zone), parsed results may be
different than in 5.x (but since 5.x didn&rsquo;t have
proper time zone handling, this is a good thing).</p>

<h2>DATE PARSING AND OPERATIONS
<a name="DATE PARSING AND OPERATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(*) today,
tomorrow, yesterday</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The words &quot;today&quot;,
&quot;tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;yesterday&quot; in 5.xx
referred to the time now, 24 hours in the future, and 24
hours in the past respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of 6.00,
these are treated strictly as date strings, so they are the
current day, the day before, or the day after at the time
00:00:00.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The string
&quot;now&quot; still refers to the current date and
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>ISO 8601</small>
formats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A couple of the date formats
from Date::Manip 5.xx conflicted with <small>ISO
8601</small> formats in the spec. These are documented in
the Date::Manip::Date documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Dates are now
parsed according to the spec (though a couple extensions
have been made, which are also documented in the
Date::Manip::Date documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
change with respect to Date::Manip 5.xx that results from a
possible misinterpretation of the standard. In Date::Manip,
there is a small amount of ambiguity in how the Www-D date
formats are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The date:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1996&minus;w02&minus;3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">might be
interpreted in two different ways. It could be interpreted
as Wednesday (day 3) of the 2nd week of 1996, or as the 3rd
day of the 2nd week of 1996 (which would be Tuesday if the
week begins on Sunday). Since the specification only works
with weeks which begin on day 1, the two are always
equivalent in the specification, and the language of the
specification doesn&rsquo;t clearly indicate one
interpretation over the other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since
Date::Manip supports the concept of weeks starting on days
other than day 1 (Monday), the two interpretations are not
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Date::Manip
5.xx, the date was interpreted as Wednesday of the 2nd week,
but I now believe that the other interpretation (3rd day of
the week) is the interpretation intended by the
specification. In addition, if this interpretation is used,
it is easy to get the other interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
1996&minus;w02&minus;3 means the 3rd day of the 2nd week,
then to get Wednesday (day 3) of the week, use the following
two Date::Manip::Date methods:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $err   = $date&minus;&gt;parse(&quot;1996&minus;w02&minus;1&quot;);
   $date2 = $date&minus;&gt;next(3,1);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The first call
gets the 1st day of the 2nd week, and the second call gets
the next Wednesday.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
1996&minus;w02&minus;3 is interpreted as Wednesday of the
2nd week, then to get the 3rd day of the week involves
significantly more work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Date::Manip
6.00, the date will now be parsed as the 3rd day of the 2nd
week.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Parsing is now more
rigid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The philosophy in Date::Manip
5.xx with respect to parsing dates was &quot;if
there&rsquo;s any conceivable way to find a valid date in
the string, do so&quot;. As a result, strings which did not
look like they could contain a valid date often would.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This manifested
itself it two ways. First, a lot of punctuation was ignored.
For example, the string &quot;01 // 03 &minus;. 75&quot; was
the date 1975&minus;01&minus;03.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Second, a lot
of word breaks were optional and it was often acceptable to
run strings together. For example, the delta
&quot;in5seconds&quot; would have worked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
Date::Manip 6.00, parsing now tries to find a valid date in
the string, but uses a more rigidly defined set of allowed
formats which should more closely match how the dates would
actually be expressed in real life. The punctuation allowed
is more rigidly defined, and word breaks are required. So
&quot;01/03/75&quot; will work, but &quot;01//03/75&quot;
and &quot;01/03&minus;75&quot; won&rsquo;t. Also,
&quot;in5seconds&quot; will no longer work, though &quot;in
5 seconds&quot; will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These changes
serve to simplify some of the regular expressions used in
parsing dates, as well as simplifying the parsing routines.
They also help to recognize actually dates as opposed to
typos... it was too easy to pass in garbage and get a date
out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Support dropped for a few
formats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">I&rsquo;ve dropped support for
a few very uncommon (probably never used) formats. These
include (with Jan 3, 2009 as an example):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   DD/YYmmm      03/09Jan
   DD/YYYYmmm    03/2009Jan
   mmmYYYY/DD    Jan2009/03
   YYYY/DDmmm    2009/03Jan
   mmmYYYY       Jan2009
   YYYYmmm       2009Jan</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The last two
are no longer supported since they are incomplete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With the
exception of the incomplete forms, these could be added back
in with very little effort. If there is ever a request to do
so, I probably will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>No longer parses the Apache
format</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip 5.xx supported the
format:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   DD/mmm/YYYY:HH:MN:SS</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">used in the
apache logs. Due to the stricter parsing, this format is no
longer supported directly. However, the parse_format method
may be used to parse the date directly from an apache log
line with no need to extract the date string beforehand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date_PrevWorkDay
behavior</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The behavior of
Date_PrevWorkDay has changed slightly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The starting
date is checked. If <tt>$timecheck</tt> was non-zero, the
check failed if the date was not a business date, or if the
time was not during business hours. If <tt>$timecheck</tt>
was zero, the check failed if the date was not a business
date, but the time was ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In 5.xx, if the
check failed, and <tt>$timecheck</tt> was non-zero, day 0
was defined as the start of the next business day, but if
<tt>$timecheck</tt> was zero, day 0 was defined as the
previous business day at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In 6.x, if the
check fails, and <tt>$timecheck</tt> is non-zero, the
behavior is the same as before. If <tt>$timecheck</tt> is
zero, day 0 is defined as the next business day at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So day 0 is now
always the same, where before, day 0 meant two different
things depending on whether <tt>$timecheck</tt> was zero or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>(*) Default time</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.xx, the
default times for dates was handled in an inconsistent
manner. In the Date::Manip::Date documentation, if you parse
a date from the &quot;Common date formats&quot; section, in
Date::Manip 5.xx, if no time was included, it defaulted to
&quot;00:00:00&quot;. If you parsed a date from the
&quot;Less common formats&quot; section, the default time
was the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So running a
program on Jun 5, 2009 at noon that parsed the following
dates gave the following return values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Jun 12     =&gt;  Jun 12, 2009 at 00:00:00
   next week  =&gt;  Jun 12, 2009 at 12:00:00</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This behavior
is changed and now relies on the config variable
DefaultTime. If DefaultTime is &quot;curr&quot;, the default
time for any date which includes no information about the
time is the current time. Otherwise, the default time is
midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>%z format</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.xx, the
<tt>%z</tt> format would give an offset in the form:
&minus;0500. Now it gives it in the form:
&minus;05:00:00</p>

<h2>DELTAS
<a name="DELTAS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dropped
mixed style delta parsing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.xx, a parsed
delta could be written in the delta style</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1:2:3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or in a
language-specific expanded form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1 hour 2 minutes 3 seconds</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or in a mixed
form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1 hour 2:3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The mixed form
has been dropped since I doubt that it sees much use in real
life, and by dropping the mixed form, the parsing is much
simpler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Approximate date/date
calculations</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.xx, the
approximate delta between the two dates:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   Jan 10 1996 noon
   Jan  7 1998 noon</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">was
+1:11:4:0:0:0:0 (or 1 year, 11 months, 4 weeks). As of
Date::Manip 6.0, the delta is +2:0:&minus;0:3:0:0:0 (or 2
years minus 3 days). Although this leads to mixed-sign
deltas, it is actually how more people would think about the
delta. It has the additional advantage of being
<small>MUCH</small> easier and faster to calculate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Approximate relationships in
deltas</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When printing parts of deltas
in Date::Manip::5.xx, the approximate relationship of 1 year
= 365.25 days was used. This is the correct value for the
Julian calendar, but for the Gregorian calendar, a better
value is 365.2425, and this is used in version 6.00.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Old style formats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The formats used in the printf
command are slightly different than in the old Delta_Format
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The old formats
are described in the Date::Manip manual, and the new ones
are in the Date::Manip::Delta manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The new formats
are much more flexible and I encourage you to switch over,
however at this point, the old style formats are officially
supported for the Delta_Format command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At some point,
the old style formats may be deprecated (and removed at some
point beyond that), but for now, they are not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The old formats
are <small>NOT</small> available using the printf
method.</p>

<h2>RECURRENCES
<a name="RECURRENCES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The day
field meaning changed in a few recurrences</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value of the day field can
refer to several different things including the day of week
number (Monday=1 to Sunday=7), day of month (1&minus;31),
day of year (1&minus;366), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Date::Manip
5.xx, it could also refer to the nth day of the week (i.e. 1
being the 1st day of the week, &minus;1 being the last day
of the week). This meaning is no longer used in 6.xx.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the recurrence:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*2:3:4:0:0:0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">referred to the
3rd occurence of the 4th day of the week in February.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The meaning has
been changed to refer to the 3rd occurence of day 4
(Thursday) in February. This is a much more useful type of
recurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a result of
this change, the related recurrence:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   1*2:3:&minus;1:0:0:0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is invalid.
Negative numbers may be used to refer to the nth day of the
week, but <small>NOT</small> when referring to the day of
week numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Recurrence range now
inclusive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously, the list of dates
implied by the recurrence were on or after the start date,
but before the end date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This has been
changed so that the dates may be on or before the end
date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Dropped support for a couple
English recurrences</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Date::Manip 5.xx claimed
support for a recurrence:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   every 2nd day in June [1997]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In actuality,
this recurrence is not practical to calculate. It requires a
base date which might imply June 1,3,5,... in 1997 but June
2,4,6 in 1998.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the recurrence does not fit the mold for other recurrences
that are an approximate distance apart. This type of
recurrence has a number of closely spaced events with
11&minus;month gaps between groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I no longer
consider this a valid recurrence and support is now dropped
for this string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I also dropped
the following for a similar reason:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   every 6th tuesday [in 1999]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Other minor recurrence
changes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously, ParseRecur would
supply default dates if the start or end were missing. This
is no longer done.</p>

<h2>DATE::MANIP FUNCTIONS
<a name="DATE::MANIP FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Date::Manip
module contains the same functions that Date::Manip 5.xx had
(though the <small>OO</small> modules do all the work now).
In general, the routines behave the same as before with the
following exceptions: <b><br>
Date_ConvTZ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously, Date_ConvTZ took 1
to 4 arguments and used the local time zone and the ConvTZ
config variable to fill in missing arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Now, the
Date_ConvTZ function only supports a 3 argument call:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date = Date_ConvTZ($date,$from,$to);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>$from</tt> is not given, it defaults to the local time
zone. If <tt>$to</tt> is not given, it defaults to the local
time zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
4th argument ($errlevel) is no longer supported. If there is
an error, an empty string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>DateCalc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Date::Manip 5.xx, it was
recommended that you pass arguments to ParseDate or
ParseDateDelta. This is not recommended with 6.00 since it
is much more intelligent about handling the arguments, and
you&rsquo;ll just end up parsing the date/delta twice.</p>
