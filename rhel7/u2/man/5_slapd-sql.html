<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">slapd&minus;sql
&minus; SQL backend to slapd</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
purpose of this <b>slapd</b>(8) backend is to PRESENT
information stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without
any programming (some SQL and maybe stored procedures
can&rsquo;t be considered programming, anyway ;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That is, for
example, when you (some ISP) have account information you
use in an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that
expect such information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make
email lookups etc.). Or you want to synchronize or
distribute information between different sites/applications
that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is NOT
designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS
instead of BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does),
though it can be used as such with several limitations. You
can take a look at
<b>http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=378</b>
(OpenLDAP FAQ&minus;O&minus;Matic/General LDAP
FAQ/Directories vs. conventional databases) to find out more
on this point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The idea
(detailed below) is to use some meta-information to
translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational
schema untouched, so that old applications can continue
using it without any modifications. This allows SQL and LDAP
applications to inter-operate without replication, and
exchange data as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL backend
is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema
without having to change source (through that
meta-information mentioned). Also, it uses ODBC to connect
to RDBMSes, and is highly configurable for SQL dialects
RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for integration and
distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts etc.,
in other words, in highly heterogeneous environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend is
<i>experimental</i>.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
<b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the SQL backend database,
which means that they must follow a &quot;database sql&quot;
line and come before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or
&quot;database&quot; lines. Other database options not
specific to this backend are described in the
<b>slapd.conf</b>(5) manual page.</p>

<h2>DATA SOURCE CONFIGURATION
<a name="DATA SOURCE CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dbname
&lt;datasource name&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The name of the ODBC datasource
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dbhost
&lt;hostname&gt; <br>
dbpasswd &lt;password&gt; <br>
dbuser &lt;username&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The three above options are
generally unneeded, because this information is taken from
the datasource specified by the <b>dbname</b> directive.
They allow to override datasource settings. Also, several
RDBMS&rsquo; drivers tend to require explicit passing of
user/password, even if those are given in datasource (Note:
<b>dbhost</b> is currently ignored).</p>

<h2>SCOPING CONFIGURATION
<a name="SCOPING CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
specify SQL query templates for scoping searches. <b><br>
subtree_cond &lt;SQL expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a where-clause
template used to form a subtree search condition
(dn=&quot;(.+,)?&lt;dn&gt;$&quot;). It may differ from one
SQL dialect to another (see samples). By default, it is
constructed based on the knowledge about how to normalize DN
values (e.g. <b>&quot;&lt;upper_func&gt;(ldap_entries.dn)
LIKE CONCAT(&rsquo;%&rsquo;,?)&quot;</b>); see
<b>upper_func</b>, <b>upper_needs_cast</b>,
<b>concat_pattern</b> and <b>strcast_func</b> in
&quot;HELPER CONFIGURATION&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>children_cond &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a where-clause
template used to form a children search condition
(dn=&quot;.+,&lt;dn&gt;$&quot;). It may differ from one SQL
dialect to another (see samples). By default, it is
constructed based on the knowledge about how to normalize DN
values (e.g. <b>&quot;&lt;upper_func&gt;(ldap_entries.dn)
LIKE CONCAT(&rsquo;%,&rsquo;,?)&quot;</b>); see
<b>upper_func</b>, <b>upper_needs_cast</b>,
<b>concat_pattern</b> and <b>strcast_func</b> in
&quot;HELPER CONFIGURATION&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>use_subtree_shortcut { YES |
no }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not use the subtree
condition when the searchBase is the database suffix, and
the scope is subtree; rather collect all entries.</p>

<h2>STATEMENT CONFIGURATION
<a name="STATEMENT CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
specify SQL query templates for loading schema mapping
meta-information, adding and deleting entries to
ldap_entries, etc. All these and subtree_cond should have
the given default values. For the current value it is
recommended to look at the sources, or in the log output
when slapd starts with &quot;&minus;d 5&quot; or greater.
Note that the parameter number and order must not be
changed. <b><br>
oc_query &lt;SQL expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The query that is used to
collect the objectClass mapping data from table
<i>ldap_oc_mappings</i>; see &quot;METAINFORMATION
USED&quot; for details. The default is <b>&quot;SELECT id,
name, keytbl, keycol, create_proc, delete_proc,
expect_return FROM ldap_oc_mappings&quot;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>at_query &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The query that is used to
collect the attributeType mapping data from table
<i>ldap_attr_mappings</i>; see &quot;METAINFORMATION
USED&quot; for details. The default is <b>&quot;SELECT name,
sel_expr, from_tbls, join_where, add_proc, delete_proc,
param_order, expect_return FROM ldap_attr_mappings WHERE
oc_map_id=?&quot;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>id_query &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The query that is used to map a
DN to an entry in table <i>ldap_entries</i>; see
&quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot; for details. The default is
<b>&quot;SELECT id,keyval,oc_map_id,dn FROM ldap_entries
WHERE &lt;DN match expr&gt;&quot;</b>, where <b>&lt;DN match
expr&gt;</b> is constructed based on the knowledge about how
to normalize DN values (e.g. <b>&quot;dn=?&quot;</b> if no
means to uppercase strings are available; typically,
<b>&quot;&lt;upper_func&gt;(dn)=?&quot;</b> is used); see
<b>upper_func</b>, <b>upper_needs_cast</b>,
<b>concat_pattern</b> and <b>strcast_func</b> in
&quot;HELPER CONFIGURATION&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>insentry_stmt &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The statement that is used to
insert a new entry in table <i>ldap_entries</i>; see
&quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot; for details. The default is
<b>&quot;INSERT INTO ldap_entries (dn, oc_map_id, parent,
keyval) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delentry_stmt &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The statement that is used to
delete an existing entry from table <i>ldap_entries</i>; see
&quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot; for details. The default is
<b>&quot;DELETE FROM ldap_entries WHERE id=?&quot;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delobjclasses_stmt &lt;SQL
expression&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The statement that is used to
delete an existing entry&rsquo;s ID from table
<i>ldap_objclasses</i>; see &quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot;
for details. The default is <b>&quot;DELETE FROM
ldap_entry_objclasses WHERE entry_id=?&quot;</b>.</p>

<h2>HELPER CONFIGURATION
<a name="HELPER CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
statements are used to modify the default behavior of the
backend according to issues of the dialect of the RDBMS. The
first options essentially refer to string and DN
normalization when building filters. LDAP normalization is
more than upper- (or lower-)casing everything; however, as a
reasonable trade-off, for case-sensitive RDBMSes the backend
can be instructed to uppercase strings and DNs by providing
the <b>upper_func</b> directive. Some RDBMSes, to use
functions on arbitrary data types, e.g. string constants,
requires a cast, which is triggered by the
<b>upper_needs_cast</b> directive. If required, a string
cast function can be provided as well, by using the
<b>strcast_func</b> directive. Finally, a custom string
concatenation pattern may be required; it is provided by the
<b>concat_pattern</b> directive. <b><br>
upper_func &lt;SQL function name&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the name of a
function that converts a given value to uppercase. This is
used for case insensitive matching when the RDBMS is case
sensitive. It may differ from one SQL dialect to another
(e.g. <b>UCASE</b>, <b>UPPER</b> or whatever; see samples).
By default, none is used, i.e. strings are not uppercased,
so matches may be case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>upper_needs_cast { NO | yes
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set this directive to
<b>yes</b> if <b>upper_func</b> needs an explicit cast when
applied to literal strings. A cast in the form <b>CAST
(&lt;arg&gt; AS VARCHAR(&lt;max DN length&gt;))</b> is used,
where <b>&lt;max DN length&gt;</b> is builtin in back-sql;
see macro <b>BACKSQL_MAX_DN_LEN</b> (currently 255; note
that slapd&rsquo;s builtin limit, in macro
<b>SLAP_LDAPDN_MAXLEN</b>, is set to 8192). This is
<i>experimental</i> and may change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>strcast_func &lt;SQL
function name&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the name of a
function that converts a given value to a string for
appropriate ordering. This is used in &quot;SELECT
DISTINCT&quot; statements for strongly typed RDBMSes with
little implicit casting (like PostgreSQL), when a literal
string is specified. This is <i>experimental</i> and may
change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>concat_pattern
&lt;pattern&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This statement defines the
<b>pattern</b> that is used to concatenate strings. The
<b>pattern</b> MUST contain two question marks,
&rsquo;?&rsquo;, that will be replaced by the two strings
that must be concatenated. The default value is
<b>CONCAT(?,?)</b>; a form that is known to be highly
portable (IBM db2, PostgreSQL) is <b>?||?</b>, but an
explicit cast may be required when operating on literal
strings: <b>CAST(?||? AS VARCHAR(&lt;length&gt;))</b>. On
some RDBMSes (IBM db2, MSSQL) the form <b>?+?</b> is known
to work as well. Carefully check the documentation of your
RDBMS or stay with the examples for supported ones. This is
<i>experimental</i> and may change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>aliasing_keyword
&lt;string&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the aliasing keyword.
Some RDBMSes use the word &quot;<i>AS</i>&quot; (the
default), others don&rsquo;t use any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>aliasing_quote
&lt;string&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the quoting char of the
aliasing keyword. Some RDBMSes don&rsquo;t require any (the
default), others may require single or double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>has_ldapinfo_dn_ru { NO |
yes }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Explicitly inform the backend
whether the dn_ru column (DN in reverse uppercased form) is
present in table <i>ldap_entries</i>. Overrides automatic
check (this is required, for instance, by
PostgreSQL/unixODBC). This is <i>experimental</i> and may
change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fail_if_no_mapping { NO |
yes }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set to <b>yes</b> it
forces <i>attribute</i> write operations to fail if no
appropriate mapping between LDAP attributes and SQL data is
available. The default behavior is to ignore those changes
that cannot be mapped. It has no impact on objectClass
mapping, i.e. if the <i>structuralObjectClass</i> of an
entry cannot be mapped to SQL by looking up its name in
ldap_oc_mappings, an <i>add</i> operation will fail
regardless of the <b>fail_if_no_mapping</b> switch; see
section &quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot; for details. This
is <i>experimental</i> and may change in future
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allow_orphans { NO | yes
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set to <b>yes</b> orphaned
entries (i.e. without the parent entry in the database) can
be added. This option should be used with care, possibly in
conjunction with some special rule on the RDBMS side that
dynamically creates the missing parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>baseObject [
&lt;filename&gt; ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs the database to
create and manage an in-memory baseObject entry instead of
looking for one in the RDBMS. If the (optional)
<b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> argument is given, the entry is read
from that file in <b>LDIF</b>(5) format; otherwise, an entry
with objectClass <b>extensibleObject</b> is created based on
the contents of the RDN of the <i>baseObject</i>. This is
particularly useful when <i>ldap_entries</i> information is
stored in a view rather than in a table, and <b>union</b> is
not supported for views, so that the view can only specify
one rule to compute the entry structure for one objectClass.
This topic is discussed further in section
&quot;METAINFORMATION USED&quot;. This is
<i>experimental</i> and may change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>create_needs_select { NO |
yes }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs the database whether
or not entry creation in table <i>ldap_entries</i> needs a
subsequent select to collect the automatically assigned ID,
instead of being returned by a stored procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fetch_attrs
&lt;attrlist&gt; <br>
fetch_all_attrs { NO | yes }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The first statement allows to
provide a list of attributes that must always be fetched in
addition to those requested by any specific operation,
because they are required for the proper usage of the
backend. For instance, all attributes used in ACLs should be
listed here. The second statement is a shortcut to require
all attributes to be always loaded. Note that the
dynamically generated attributes, e.g.
<i>hasSubordinates</i>, <i>entryDN</i> and other
implementation dependent attributes are <b>NOT</b> generated
at this point, for consistency with the rest of slapd. This
may change in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>check_schema { YES | no
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instructs the database to check
schema adherence of entries after modifications, and
structural objectClass chain when entries are built. By
default it is set to <b>yes</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sqllayer &lt;name&gt;
[...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Loads the layer
<b>&lt;name&gt;</b> onto a stack of helpers that are used to
map DNs from LDAP to SQL representation and vice-versa.
Subsequent args are passed to the layer configuration
routine. This is <i>highly experimental</i> and should be
used with extreme care. The API of the layers is not frozen
yet, so it is unpublished.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>autocommit { NO | yes
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Activates autocommit; by
default, it is off.</p>

<h2>METAINFORMATION USED
<a name="METAINFORMATION USED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Almost
everything mentioned later is illustrated in examples
located in the
<b>servers/slapd/back&minus;sql/rdbms_depend/</b> directory
in the OpenLDAP source tree, and contains scripts for
generating sample database for Oracle, MS SQL Server, mySQL
and more (including PostgreSQL and IBM db2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first thing
that one must arrange is what set of LDAP object classes can
present your RDBMS information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The easiest way
is to create an objectClass for each entity you had in
ER-diagram when designing your relational schema. Any
relational schema, no matter how normalized it is, was
designed after some model of your application&rsquo;s domain
(for instance, accounts, services etc. in ISP), and is used
in terms of its entities, not just tables of normalized
schema. It means that for every attribute of every such
instance there is an effective SQL query that loads its
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also you might
want your object classes to conform to some of the standard
schemas like inetOrgPerson etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Nevertheless,
when you think it out, we must define a way to translate
LDAP operation requests to (a series of) SQL queries. Let us
deal with the SEARCH operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
Let&rsquo;s suppose that we store information about persons
working in our organization in two tables:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PERSONS PHONES
<br>
---------- ------------- <br>
id integer id integer <br>
first_name varchar pers_id integer references persons(id)
<br>
last_name varchar phone <br>
middle_name varchar <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(PHONES
contains telephone numbers associated with persons). A
person can have several numbers, then PHONES contains
several records with corresponding pers_id, or no numbers
(and no records in PHONES with such pers_id). An LDAP
objectclass to present such information could look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">person <br>
------- <br>
MUST cn <br>
MAY telephoneNumber $ firstName $ lastName <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To fetch all
values for cn attribute given person ID, we construct the
query:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT
CONCAT(persons.first_name,&rsquo; &rsquo;,persons.last_name)
<br>
AS cn FROM persons WHERE persons.id=?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for
telephoneNumber we can use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT
phones.phone AS telephoneNumber FROM persons,phones <br>
WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id AND persons.id=?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we wanted to
service LDAP requests with filters like
(telephoneNumber=123*), we would construct something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT ... FROM
persons,phones <br>
WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id <br>
AND persons.id=? <br>
AND phones.phone like &rsquo;%1%2%3%&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(note how the
telephoneNumber match is expanded in multiple wildcards to
account for interspersed ininfluential chars like spaces,
dashes and so; this occurs by design because telephoneNumber
is defined after a specially recognized syntax). So, if we
had information about what tables contain values for each
attribute, how to join these tables and arrange these
values, we could try to automatically generate such
statements, and translate search filters to SQL WHERE
clauses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To store such
information, we add three more tables to our schema and fill
it with data (see samples):</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ldap_oc_mappings
(some columns are not listed for clarity) <br>
--------------- <br>
id=1 <br>
name=&quot;person&quot; <br>
keytbl=&quot;persons&quot; <br>
keycol=&quot;id&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This table
defines a mapping between objectclass (its name held in the
&quot;name&quot; column), and a table that holds the primary
key for corresponding entities. For instance, in our
example, the person entity, which we are trying to present
as &quot;person&quot; objectclass, resides in two tables
(persons and phones), and is identified by the persons.id
column (that we will call the primary key for this entity).
Keytbl and keycol thus contain &quot;persons&quot; (name of
the table), and &quot;id&quot; (name of the column).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ldap_attr_mappings
(some columns are not listed for clarity) <br>
----------- <br>
id=1 <br>
oc_map_id=1 <br>
name=&quot;cn&quot; <br>
sel_expr=&quot;CONCAT(persons.first_name,&rsquo;
&rsquo;,persons.last_name)&quot; <br>
from_tbls=&quot;persons&quot; <br>
join_where=NULL <br>
************ <br>
id=&lt;n&gt; <br>
oc_map_id=1 <br>
name=&quot;telephoneNumber&quot; <br>
sel_expr=&quot;phones.phone&quot; <br>
from_tbls=&quot;persons,phones&quot; <br>
join_where=&quot;phones.pers_id=persons.id&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This table
defines mappings between LDAP attributes and SQL queries
that load their values. Note that, unlike LDAP schema, these
are not <b>attribute types</b> - the attribute
&quot;cn&quot; for &quot;person&quot; objectclass can have
its values in different tables than &quot;cn&quot; for some
other objectclass, so attribute mappings depend on
objectclass mappings (unlike attribute types in LDAP schema,
which are indifferent to objectclasses). Thus, we have
oc_map_id column with link to oc_mappings table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now we cut the
SQL query that loads values for a given attribute into 3
parts. First goes into sel_expr column - this is the
expression we had between SELECT and FROM keywords, which
defines WHAT to load. Next is table list - text between FROM
and WHERE keywords. It may contain aliases for convenience
(see examples). The last is part of the where clause, which
(if it exists at all) expresses the condition for joining
the table containing values with the table containing the
primary key (foreign key equality and such). If values are
in the same table as the primary key, then this column is
left NULL (as for cn attribute above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having this
information in parts, we are able to not only construct
queries that load attribute values by id of entry (for this
we could store SQL query as a whole), but to construct
queries that load id&rsquo;s of objects that correspond to a
given search filter (or at least part of it). See below for
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ldap_entries
<br>
------------ <br>
id=1 <br>
dn=&lt;dn you choose&gt; <br>
oc_map_id=... <br>
parent=&lt;parent record id&gt; <br>
keyval=&lt;value of primary key&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This table
defines mappings between DNs of entries in your LDAP tree,
and values of primary keys for corresponding relational
data. It has recursive structure (parent column references
id column of the same table), which allows you to add any
tree structure(s) to your flat relational data. Having id of
objectclass mapping, we can determine table and column for
primary key, and keyval stores value of it, thus defining
the exact tuple corresponding to the LDAP entry with this
DN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that such
design (see exact SQL table creation query) implies one
important constraint - the key must be an integer. But all
that I know about well-designed schemas makes me think that
it&rsquo;s not very narrow ;) If anyone needs support for
different types for keys - he may want to write a patch, and
submit it to OpenLDAP ITS, then I&rsquo;ll include it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, several
users complained that they don&rsquo;t really need very
structured trees, and they don&rsquo;t want to update one
more table every time they add or delete an instance in the
relational schema. Those people can use a view instead of a
real table for ldap_entries, something like this (by Robin
Elfrink):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE VIEW
ldap_entries (id, dn, oc_map_id, parent, keyval) <br>
AS <br>
SELECT 0, UPPER(&rsquo;o=MyCompany,c=NL&rsquo;), <br>
3, 0, &rsquo;baseObject&rsquo; FROM unixusers WHERE
userid=&rsquo;root&rsquo; <br>
UNION <br>
SELECT (1000000000+userid), <br>

UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT(&rsquo;cn=&rsquo;,gecos),&rsquo;,o=MyCompany,c=NL&rsquo;)),
<br>
1, 0, userid FROM unixusers <br>
UNION <br>
SELECT (2000000000+groupnummer), <br>

UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT(&rsquo;cn=&rsquo;,groupnaam),&rsquo;,o=MyCompany,c=NL&rsquo;)),
<br>
2, 0, groupnummer FROM groups;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your RDBMS
does not support <b>unions</b> in views, only one
objectClass can be mapped in <b>ldap_entries</b>, and the
baseObject cannot be created; in this case, see the
<b>baseObject</b> directive for a possible workaround.</p>

<h2>TYPICAL SQL BACKEND OPERATION
<a name="TYPICAL SQL BACKEND OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having
meta-information loaded, the SQL backend uses these tables
to determine a set of primary keys of candidates (depending
on search scope and filter). It tries to do it for each
objectclass registered in ldap_objclasses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example: for
our query with filter (telephoneNumber=123*) we would get
the following query generated (which loads candidate
IDs)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT
ldap_entries.id,persons.id, &rsquo;person&rsquo; AS
objectClass, <br>
ldap_entries.dn AS dn <br>
FROM ldap_entries,persons,phones <br>
WHERE persons.id=ldap_entries.keyval <br>
AND ldap_entries.objclass=? <br>
AND ldap_entries.parent=? <br>
AND phones.pers_id=persons.id <br>
AND (phones.phone LIKE &rsquo;%1%2%3%&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(for ONELEVEL
search) or &quot;... AND dn=?&quot; (for BASE search) or
&quot;... AND dn LIKE &rsquo;%?&rsquo;&quot; (for
SUBTREE)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, for each
candidate, we load the requested attributes using
per-attribute queries like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT
phones.phone AS telephoneNumber <br>
FROM persons,phones <br>
WHERE persons.id=? AND phones.pers_id=persons.id</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, we use
test_filter() from the frontend API to test the entry for a
full LDAP search filter match (since we cannot effectively
make sense of SYNTAX of corresponding LDAP schema attribute,
we translate the filter into the most relaxed SQL condition
to filter candidates), and send it to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ADD, DELETE,
MODIFY and MODRDN operations are also performed on
per-attribute meta-information (add_proc etc.). In those
fields one can specify an SQL statement or stored procedure
call which can add, or delete given values of a given
attribute, using the given entry keyval (see examples --
mostly PostgreSQL, ORACLE and MSSQL - since as of this
writing there are no stored procs in MySQL).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We just add
more columns to ldap_oc_mappings and ldap_attr_mappings,
holding statements to execute (like create_proc, add_proc,
del_proc etc.), and flags governing the order of parameters
passed to those statements. Please see samples to find out
what are the parameters passed, and other information on
this matter - they are self-explanatory for those familiar
with the concepts expressed above.</p>

<h2>COMMON TECHNIQUES
<a name="COMMON TECHNIQUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First of all,
let&rsquo;s recall that among other major differences to the
complete LDAP data model, the above illustrated concept does
not directly support such features as multiple objectclasses
per entry, and referrals. Fortunately, they are easy to
adopt in this scheme. The SQL backend requires that one more
table is added to the schema:
ldap_entry_objectclasses(entry_id,oc_name).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That table
contains any number of objectclass names that corresponding
entries will possess, in addition to that mentioned in
mapping. The SQL backend automatically adds attribute
mapping for the &quot;objectclass&quot; attribute to each
objectclass mapping that loads values from this table. So,
you may, for instance, have a mapping for inetOrgPerson, and
use it for queries for &quot;person&quot; objectclass...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Referrals used
to be implemented in a loose manner by adding an extra table
that allowed any entry to host a &quot;ref&quot; attribute,
along with a &quot;referral&quot; extra objectClass in table
ldap_entry_objclasses. In the current implementation,
referrals are treated like any other user-defined schema,
since &quot;referral&quot; is a structural objectclass. The
suggested practice is to define a &quot;referral&quot; entry
in ldap_oc_mappings, holding a naming attribute, e.g.
&quot;ou&quot; or &quot;cn&quot;, a &quot;ref&quot;
attribute, containing the url; in case multiple referrals
per entry are needed, a separate table for urls can be
created, where urls are mapped to the respective entries.
The use of the naming attribute usually requires to add an
&quot;extensibleObject&quot; value to
ldap_entry_objclasses.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As previously
stated, this backend should not be considered a replacement
of other data storage backends, but rather a gateway to
existing RDBMS storages that need to be published in LDAP
form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>hasSubordintes</b> operational attribute is honored by
back-sql in search results and in compare operations; it is
partially honored also in filtering. Owing to design
limitations, a (brain-dead?) filter of the form
<b>(!(hasSubordinates=TRUE))</b> will give no results
instead of returning all the leaf entries, because it
actually expands into <b>... AND NOT (1=1)</b>. If you need
to find all the leaf entries, please use
<b>(hasSubordinates=FALSE)</b> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
directoryString value of the form
&quot;__First___Last_&quot; (where underscores mean spaces,
ASCII 0x20 char) corresponds to its prettified counterpart
&quot;First_Last&quot;; this is not currently honored by
back-sql if non-prettified data is written via RDBMS; when
non-prettified data is written through back-sql, the
prettified values are actually used instead.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>ldap_entry_objclasses</b> table is empty, filters on the
<b>objectClass</b> attribute erroneously result in no
candidates. A workaround consists in adding at least one row
to that table, no matter if valid or not.</p>

<h2>PROXY CACHE OVERLAY
<a name="PROXY CACHE OVERLAY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The proxy cache
overlay allows caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in
a local database. See <b>slapo&minus;pcache</b>(5) for
details.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are

source tree.</p>

<h2>ACCESS CONTROL
