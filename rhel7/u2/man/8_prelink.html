prelink ELF shared libraries and binaries to speed up
startup time</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

[OPTION...]&nbsp;[FILES]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>prelink</b>
is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF
dynamically linked binaries in such a way that the time
needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations at
startup significantly decreases. Due to fewer relocations,
the run-time memory consumption decreases as well
(especially the number of unshareable pages). The prelinking
information is only used at startup time if none of the
dependent libraries have changed since prelinking; otherwise
programs are relocated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>prelink</b>
first collects ELF binaries to be prelinked and all the ELF
shared libraries they depend on. Then it assigns a unique
virtual address space slot to each library and relinks the
shared library to that base address. When the dynamic linker
attempts to load such a library, unless that virtual address
space slot is already occupied, it maps the library into the
given slot. After this is done, <b>prelink</b>, with the
help of dynamic linker, resolves all relocations in the
binary or library against its dependent libraries and stores
the relocations into the ELF object. It also stores a list
of all dependent libraries together with their checksums
into the binary or library. For binaries, it also computes a
list of <i>conflicts</i> (relocations that resolve
differently in the binary&rsquo;s symbol search scope than
in the smaller search scope in which the dependent library
was resolved) and stores it into a special ELF section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At runtime, the
dynamic linker first checks whether all dependent libraries
were successfully mapped into their designated address space
slots, and whether they have not changed since the
prelinking was done. If all checks are successful, the
dynamic linker just replays the list of conflicts (which is
usually significantly shorter than total number of
relocations) instead of relocating each library.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;v&nbsp;&minus;&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Verbose mode. Print the virtual
address slots assigned to libraries and what binary or
library is currently being prelinked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;n&nbsp;&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t actually prelink
anything; just collect the binaries/libraries, assign them
addresses, and with <b>&minus;v</b> print what would be
prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;a
&minus;&minus;all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prelink all binaries and
dependent libraries found in directory hierarchies specified
in <i>/etc/prelink.conf</i>. Normally, only binaries
specified on the command line and their dependent libraries
are prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m
&minus;&minus;conserve&minus;memory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When assigning addresses to
libraries, allow overlap of address space slots provided
that the two libraries are not present together in any of
the binaries or libraries. This results in a smaller virtual
address space range used for libraries. On the other hand,
if <b>prelink</b> sees a binary during incremental
prelinking which puts together two libraries which were not
present together in any other binary and were given the same
virtual address space slots, then the binary cannot be
prelinked. Without this option, each library is assigned a
unique virtual address space slot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;R
&minus;&minus;random</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When assigning addresses to
libraries, start with a random address within the
architecture-dependent virtual address space range. This can
make some buffer overflow attacks slightly harder to
exploit, because libraries are not present on the same
addresses across different machines. Normally, assigning
virtual addresses starts at the bottom of the
architecture-dependent range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;r
&minus;&minus;reloc&minus;only=ADDRESS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instead of prelinking, just
relink given shared libraries to the specified base
address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;N
&minus;&minus;no&minus;update&minus;cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t save the cache file
after prelinking. Normally, the list of libraries (and with
<b>&minus;m</b> binaries also) is stored into the
<i>/etc/prelink.cache</i> file together with their given
address space slots and dependencies, so the cache can be
used during incremental prelinking (prelinking without
<b>&minus;a</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c
&minus;&minus;config&minus;file=CONFIG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate config
file instead of default <i>/etc/prelink.conf</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C
&minus;&minus;cache&minus;file=CACHE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate cache file
instead of default <i>/etc/prelink.cache</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f
&minus;&minus;force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force re-prelinking even for
already prelinked objects whose dependencies are unchanged.
This option causes new virtual address space slots to be
assigned to all libraries. Normally, only binaries or
libraries which are either not prelinked yet, or whose
dependencies have changed, are prelinked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;q
&minus;&minus;quick</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Run prelink in quick mode. This
mode checks just mtime and ctime timestamps of libraries and
binaries stored in the cache file. If they are unchanged
from the last prelink run, it is assumed that the library in
question did not change, without parsing or verifying its
ELF headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p
&minus;&minus;print&minus;cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the contents of the cache
file (normally <i>/etc/prelink.cache</i>) and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dynamic&minus;linker=LDSO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate dynamic
linker instead of the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ld&minus;library&minus;path=PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a special
<i>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</i> to be used when <b>prelink</b>
queries the dynamic linker about symbol resolution
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;layout&minus;page&minus;size=SIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Layout start of libraries at
given boundary.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;libs&minus;only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only prelink ELF shared
libraries, don&rsquo;t prelink any binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h
&minus;&minus;dereference</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When processing command line
directory arguments, follow symbolic links when walking
directory hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l
&minus;&minus;one&minus;file&minus;system</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When processing command line
directory arguments, limit directory tree walk to a single
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u
&minus;&minus;undo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Revert binaries and libraries
to their original content before they were prelinked.
Without the <i>&minus;a</i> option, this causes only the
binaries and libraries specified on the command line to be
reverted to their original state (and e.g. not their
dependencies). If used together with the <i>&minus;a</i>
option, all binaries and libraries from command line, all
their dependencies, all binaries found in directories
specified on command line and in the config file, and all
their dependencies are undone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;y
&minus;&minus;verify</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Verifies a prelinked binary or
library. This option can be used only on a single binary or
library. It first applies an <i>&minus;&minus;undo</i>
operation on the file, then prelinks just that file again
and compares this with the original file. If both are
identical, it prints the file after
<i>&minus;&minus;undo</i> operation on standard output and
exits with zero status. Otherwise it exits with error
status. Thus if <i>&minus;&minus;verify</i> operation
returns zero exit status and its standard output is equal to
the content of the binary or library before prelinking, you
can be sure that nobody modified the binaries or libraries
after prelinking. Similarly with message digests and
checksums (unless you trigger the improbable case of
modified file and original file having the same digest or
checksum).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;exec&minus;shield
&minus;&minus;no&minus;exec&minus;shield</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">On IA-32, if the kernel
supports Exec-Shield, prelink attempts to lay libraries out
similarly to how the kernel places them (i.e. if possible
below the binary, most widely used into the ASCII armor
zone). These switches allow overriding prelink detection of
whether Exec-Shield is supported or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b
&minus;&minus;black&minus;list=PATH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option allows blacklisting
certain paths, libraries or binaries. Prelink will not touch
them during prelinking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o
&minus;&minus;undo&minus;output=FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When performing an
<b>&minus;&minus;undo</b> operation, don&rsquo;t overwrite
the prelinked binary or library with its original content
(before it was prelinked), but save that into the specified
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;V

<h2>ARGUMENTS
<a name="ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Command-line
arguments should be either directory hierarchies (in which
case <i>&minus;l</i> and <i>&minus;h</i> options apply), or
particular ELF binaries or shared libraries. Specifying a
shared library explicitly on the command line causes it to
be prelinked even if no binary is linked against it.
Otherwise, binaries are collected together and only the
libraries they depend on are prelinked with them.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">#
/usr/sbin/prelink -avmR</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">prelinks all binaries found in
directories specified in <i>/etc/prelink.conf</i> and all
their dependent libraries, assigning libraries unique
virtual address space slots only if they ever appear
together, and starts assigning libraries at a random
address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"># /usr/sbin/prelink -vm
~/bin/progx</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">prelinks ~/bin/progx program
and all its dependent libraries (unless they were prelinked
already e.g. during <i>prelink &minus;a</i> invocation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"># /usr/sbin/prelink -au</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">reverts all binaries and
libraries to their original content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"># /usr/sbin/prelink -y
/bin/prelinked_prog &gt; /tmp/original_prog; echo $?
verifies whether /bin/prelinked_prog is unchanged.</p>

<p>Configuration file containing a list of directory
hierarchies that contain ELF shared libraries or binaries
which should be prelinked. This configuration file is used
in <b>&minus;a</b> mode to find binaries which should be
prelinked and also, no matter whether <b>&minus;a</b> is
given or not, to limit which dependent shared libraries
should be prelinked. If <b>prelink</b> finds a dependent
library of some binary or other library which is not present
in any of the directories specified either in
<b>/etc/prelink.conf</b> or on the command line, then it
cannot be prelinked. Each line of the config file should be
either a comment starting with <b>#</b>, or a directory
name, or a blacklist specification. Directory names can be
prefixed by the <b>&minus;l</b> switch, meaning the tree
walk of the given directory is only limited to one file
system; or the <b>&minus;h</b> switch, meaning the tree walk
of the given directory follows symbolic links. A blacklist
specification should be prefixed by <b>&minus;b</b> and
optionally also <b>&minus;l</b> or <b>&minus;h</b> if
needed. A blacklist entry can be either an absolute
directory name (in that case all files in that directory
hierarchy are ignored by the prelinker); an absolute
filename (then that particular library or binary is
skipped); or a glob pattern without a <b>/</b> character in
it (then all files matching that glob in any directory are
ignored).</p> </td></tr>
