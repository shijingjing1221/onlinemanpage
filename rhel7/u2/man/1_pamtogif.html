<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a GIF file as
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
creates only individual GIF images. To combine multiple GIF
images into an animated GIF, use
<a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/"><b>gifsicle</b></a>
(not part of the Netpbm package).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
creates either an original GIF87 format GIF file or the
newer GIF89 format. It creates GIF89 when you request
features that were new with GIF89, to wit the
<b>-transparent</b> or <b>-comment</b> options. Otherwise,
it creates GIF87. Really old GIF readers conceivably could
not recognize GIF89.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The GIF format
is not capable of representing an image with more than 256
colors in it (it contains a color map with a maximum size of
256). If the image you want to convert has more colors than
that (<b>ppmhist</b> can tell you), you can use
<b>pnmquant</b> to reduce it to 256.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your input
image is a PAM with transparency information,
<b>ppmtogif</b> uses one entry in the GIF colormap
specifically for the transparent pixels, so you can have at
most 255 opaque colors. In contrast, if you use the
<b>-transparent</b> option, one of the colors from the input
becomes transparent, so the limit is still 256.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). In older Netpbm,
use <b>ppmtogif</b>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-interlace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produce an interlaced GIF
file.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>-sort</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Produce a GIF file with a color map sorted in a
predictable order.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This does
<i>not</i> produce the sorted color map which is part of the
GIF format. That kind of sorted color map is one where the
colors are sorted according to how important they are, and
the GIF header tells the viewer that it is sorted that way.
Its purpose is to allow the viewer to use fewer colors than
are in the color map if it is not capable of displaying all
the colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">What this
option produces is a color map sorted by red value, then
green, then blue. That can be useful in analyzing GIF
images, particularly those made with two versions of the
program, because it removes some of the variability.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-mapfile=</b><i>mapfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use the colors
found in the file <i>mapfile</i> to create the colormap in
the GIF file, instead of the colors from <i>netpbmfile</i>.
<i>mapfile</i> can be any PPM file; all that matters is the
colors in it. If the colors in <i>netpbmfile</i> do not
match those in <i>mapfile</i>, <b>pamtogif</b> matches them
to a &rsquo;best match.&rsquo; You can obtain a much better
result by using <b>pnmremap</b> to change the colors in the
input to those in the map file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mapfile</i> file is not a palette file, just an image
whose colors you want to use. The order of colors in the GIF
palette have nothing to do with where they appear in the
<i>mapfile</i> image, and duplication of colors in the image
is irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The map
file&rsquo;s depth must match the number of color components
in the input (which is not necessarily the same as the
input&rsquo;s depth -- the input might have an alpha plane
in addition). If your map file does not, or it <i>might</i>
not, run your input through <b>pnmremap</b> using the same
map file so that it does.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-transparent=</b><i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>pamtogif</b> marks the
specified color as transparent in the GIF image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b>
does not mark any color transparent (except as indicated by
the transparency information in the input file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Specify the
color (<i>color</i>) as described for the
<a href="libppm.html#colorname">argument of the
<b>ppm_parsecolor()</b> library routine</a> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the color
you specify is not present in the image, <b>pamtogif</b>
selects instead the color in the image that is closest to
the one you specify. Closeness is measured as a Cartesian
distance between colors in RGB space. If multiple colors are
equidistant, <b>pamtogif</b> chooses one of them
arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
prefix your color specification with &rsquo;=&rsquo;, e.g.
<b>-transparent==red</b>, only the exact color you specify
will be transparent. If that color does not appear in the
image, there will be no transparency. <b>pamtogif</b> issues
an information message when this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When you
specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b> ignores
explicit transparency information (the &rsquo;alpha
channel&rsquo;) in the input image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-alpha=</b><i>pgmfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">There is no <b>-alpha</b>
option. <b>pamtogif</b>&rsquo;s predecessor had such an
option because it was not capable of taking PAM input that
contains a transparency (alpha) plane, so one used this
option to supply a transparency plane as a separate PGM
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
names a PGM file that contains an alpha mask for the image.
<b>pamtogif</b> creates fully transparent pixels wherever
the alpha mask indicates transparency greater than 50%. The
color of those pixels is that specified by the
<b>-alphacolor</b> option, or black by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To do this,
<b>pamtogif</b> creates an entry in the GIF colormap in
addition to the entries for colors that are actually in the
image. It marks that colormap entry as transparent and uses
that colormap index in the output image to create a
transparent pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The alpha image
must be the same dimensions as the input image, but may have
any maxval. White means opaque and black means
transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You cannot
specify both <b>-transparent</b> and <b>-alpha</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-alphacolor=</b><i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This specifies the foreground
color for transparent pixels. A viewer may use the
foreground color for a transparent pixel if it chooses not
to have another color &rsquo;show through.&rsquo;. The
default is black.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This applies
only to pixels that are transparent in the GIF because they
are transparent in the Netpbm input. If a GIF pixel is
transparent because of the <b>-transparent</b> option, the
foreground color is the color indicated by that option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
GIF, all transparent pixels have the same foreground color.
(There is only one entry in the GIF colormap for transparent
pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Specify the
color (<i>color</i>) as described for the
<a href="libppm.html#colorname">argument of the
<b>ppm_parsecolor()</b> library routine</a> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-comment=</b><i>text</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Include a comment in the GIF
output with comment text <i>text</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, there are no comments in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in a
command shell, you&rsquo;ll have to use quotation marks
around <i>text</i> if it contains characters (e.g. space)
that would make the shell think it is multiple arguments:
<br>
$ pamtogif -comment &quot;this is a comment&quot;
&lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif</p>

<p>This option is mainly of historical interest -- it

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
causes the GIF output, and thus <b>pamtogif</b>, not to use
LZW (Lempel-Ziv) compression. As a result, the image file is
larger and, before the patent expired, no royalties would be
owed to the holder of the patent on LZW. See the section
LICENSE below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">LZW is a method
for combining the information from multiple pixels into a
single GIF code. With the <b>-nolzw</b> option,
<b>pamtogif</b> creates one GIF code per pixel, so it is not
doing any compression and not using LZW. However, any GIF
decoder, whether it uses an LZW decompressor or not, will
correctly decode this uncompressed format. An LZW
decompressor would see this as a particular case of LZW
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
someone uses an LZW decompressor such as the one in
<b>giftopnm</b> or pretty much any graphics display program
to process the output of <b>pamtogif -nolzw</b> , he is then
using the LZW patent. But the patent holder expressed far
less interest in enforcing the patent on decoding than on
encoding.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-aspect=</b><i>fraction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the aspect ratio of the
pixels of the image. Its only effect is to record that
information in the GIF for use by whatever interprets the
GIF. Note that this feature of GIF is hardly ever used and
most GIF decoders ignore this information and assume pixels
are square.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Pixels in a
Netpbm image do not have aspect ratios; there is always a
one-one correspondence between GIF pixels and Netpbm
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The aspect
ratio is the quotient of width divided by height. GIF allows
aspect ratios from 0.25 (1:4) to 4 (4:1) in increments of
1/64. <b>pamtogif</b> implements a natural extension of GIF
that allows an aspect ratio up to 4 14/64. If you specify
anything outside this range, <b>pamtogif</b> fails.
<b>pamtogif</b> rounds <i>fraction</i> to the nearest
1/64.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
square (1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). Before that, the pixels
are always square.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option causes
<b>pamtogif</b> to display information about the conversion
process and the image it produces.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). It replaced
<b>ppmtogif</b>, which created GIF images for Pbmplus/Netpbm
users since 1989.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
outward change in the conversion from <b>ppmtogif</b> to
<b>pamtogif</b> was that <b>pamtogif</b> was able to use
transparency information (&rsquo;alpha channel&rsquo;) in
PAM input, whereas with <b>ppmtogif</b>, one had to supply
the transparency mask in a separate pseudo-PGM image (via
the <b>-alpha</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jef Poskanzer
wrote <b>ppmtogif</b> in 1989, and it has always been a
cornerstone of Pbmplus/Netpbm because GIF is such a popular
image format. Jef based the LZW encoding on GIFENCOD by
David Rowley &lt;<i>mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu</i>&gt;. Jef
included GIFENCOD&rsquo;s GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.
Rowley, in turn, adapted the LZW compression code from
classic Unix <b>compress</b>, which used techniques
described in IEEE Computer, June 1984.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jef&rsquo;s
<b>ppmtogif</b> notably lacked the ability to use a
transparency mask with it. You could create transparent
pixels in a GIF, but only with the <b>-transparent</b>
option, which allowed one to specify that all pixels of a
certain color in the input were to be transparent. Bryan
Henderson added the <b>-alpha</b> option in July 2001 so you
could supply a mask image that indicates exactly which
pixels are to be transparent, and those pixels could have
the same color as other opaque ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bryan Henderson
added another significant piece of code and function in
October 2001: the ability to generate a GIF without using
the LZW patent -- an uncompressed GIF. This was very
important to many people at the time because the GIF patent
was still in force, and this allowed them to make an image
that any GIF viewer could display, royalty-free. Bryan
adapted code from the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s
<b>djpeg</b> for that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
code in <b>pamtogif</b> from Jef&rsquo;s original, but Jef
may still hold copyright over it due to the way in which it
evolved. Virtually all of the code in <b>pamtogif</b> was
written by Bryan Henderson and contributed to the public
domain.</p>

<h2>LICENSE
<a name="LICENSE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
<b>pamtogif</b> without the <b>-nolzw</b> option, you are
using a patent on the LZW compression method which is owned
by Unisys. The patent has expired (in 2003 in the US and in
2004 elsewhere), so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. While the
patent was in force, most people who used <b>pamtogif</b>
and similar programs did so without a license from Unisys to
do so. Unisys typically asked $5000 for a license for
trivial use of the patent. Unisys never enforced the patent
against trivial users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rumor has it
that IBM also owns or owned a patent covering
<b>pamtogif</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A replacement
for the GIF format that never required any patents to use is
the PNG format.</p>
