<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DBD::File::Roadmap
&minus; Planned Enhancements for DBD::File and pure Perl
DBD&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jens Rehsack
&minus; May 2010</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
gives a high level overview of the future of the DBD::File
<small>DBI</small> driver and groundwork for pure Perl
<small>DBI</small> drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The planned
enhancements cover features, testing, performance,
reliability, extensibility and more.</p>

<h2>CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS
<a name="CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Features</b>
<br>
There are some features missing we would like to add, but
there is no time plan: <small><br>
LOCK TABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The newly implemented internal
common table meta storage area would allow us to implement
<small>LOCK TABLE</small> support based on file system
<tt>&quot;flock ()&quot;</tt> support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Transaction support</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">While DBD::AnyData recommends
explicitly committing by importing and exporting tables,
DBD::File might be enhanced in a future version to allow
transparent transactions using the temporary tables of
SQL::Statement as shadow (dirty) tables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Transaction
support will heavily rely on lock table support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Data Dictionary Persistence</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">SQL::Statement provides
dictionary information when a &quot; <small>CREATE TABLE
...&quot;</small> statement is executed. This dictionary is
preserved for some statement handle attribute fetches (as
<tt>&quot;NULLABLE&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;PRECISION&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is planned
to extend DBD::File to support data dictionaries to work on
the tables in it. It is not planned to support one table in
different dictionaries, but you can have several
dictionaries in one directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SQL</small> Engine
selecting on connect</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Currently the
<small>SQL</small> engine selected is chosen during the
loading of the module DBI::SQL::Nano. Ideally end users
should be able to select the engine used in
<tt>&quot;DBI&minus;&gt;connect ()&quot;</tt> with a special
DBD::File attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other points of
view to the planned features (and more features for the
SQL::Statement engine) are shown in
SQL::Statement::Roadmap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Testing</b>
<br>
DBD::File and the dependent <small>DBD::DBM</small> requires
a lot more automated tests covering <small>API</small>
stability and compatibility with optional modules like
SQL::Statement.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Performance</b>
<br>
Several arguments for support of features like indexes on
columns and cursors are made for <small>DBD::CSV</small>
(which is a DBD::File based driver, too). Similar arguments
could be made for <small>DBD::DBM,</small> DBD::AnyData,
<small>DBD::RAM</small> or <small>DBD::PO</small> etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To improve the
performance of the underlying <small>SQL</small> engines, a
clean re-implementation seems to be required. Currently both
engines are prematurely optimized and therefore it is not
trivial to provide further optimization without the risk of
breaking existing features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Join the
<small>DBI</small> developers <small>IRC</small> channel at
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org/dbi&gt; to participate or post to the
<small>DBI</small> Developers Mailing List.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reliability</b>
<br>
DBD::File currently lacks the following points: <br>
duplicate table names</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It is currently possible to
access a table quoted with a relative path (a) and
additionally using an absolute path (b). If (a) and (b) are
the same file that is not recognized (except for flock
protection handled by the Operating System) and two
independent tables are handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invalid table names</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current implementation does
not prevent someone choosing a directory name as a physical
file name for the table to open.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extensibility</b>
<br>
I (Jens Rehsack) have some (partially for example only)
<small>DBD</small> &rsquo;s in mind: <br>
DBD::Sys</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Derive DBD::Sys from a common
code base shared with DBD::File which handles all the
emulation <small>DBI</small> needs (as getinfo,
<small>SQL</small> engine handling, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">DBD::Dir</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provide a DBD::File derived to
work with fixed table definitions through the file system to
demonstrate how <small>DBI /</small> Pure Perl DBDs could
handle databases with hierarchical structures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">DBD::Join</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provide a <small>DBI</small>
driver which is able to manage multiple connections to other
Databases (as DBD::Multiplex), but allow them to point to
different data sources and allow joins between the tables of
them:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  # Example
  # Let table 'lsof' being a table in DBD::Sys giving a list of open files using lsof utility
  # Let table 'dir' being a atable from DBD::Dir
  $sth = $dbh&minus;&gt;prepare( &quot;select * from dir,lsof where path='/documents' and dir.entry = lsof.filename&quot; )
  $sth&minus;&gt;execute(); # gives all open files in '/documents'
  ...
  # Let table 'filesys' a DBD::Sys table of known file systems on current host
  # Let table 'applications' a table of your Configuration Management Database
  #  where current applications (relocatable, with mountpoints for filesystems)
  #  are stored
  $sth = dbh&minus;&gt;prepare( &quot;select * from applications,filesys where &quot; .
                       &quot;application.mountpoint = filesys.mountpoint and &quot;.
                       &quot;filesys.mounted is true&quot; );
  $sth&minus;&gt;execute(); # gives all currently mounted applications on this host</pre>


<h2>PRIORITIES
<a name="PRIORITIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Our priorities
are focused on current issues. Initially many new test cases
for DBD::File and <small>DBD::DBM</small> should be added to
the <small>DBI</small> test suite. After that some
additional documentation on how to use the DBD::File
<small>API</small> will be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any additional
priorities will come later and can be modified by (paying)
users.</p>
