<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Pflogsumm is a log analyzer/summarizer for the Postfix MTA.  It is
    designed to provide an over&minus;view of Postfix activity, with just enough
    detail to give the administrator a &quot;heads up&quot; for potential trouble
    spots.
    Pflogsumm generates summaries and, in some cases, detailed reports of
    mail server traffic volumes, rejected and bounced email, and server
    warnings, errors and panics.</pre>


<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    &minus;&minus;bounce_detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Limit detailed bounce reports to the top &lt;cnt&gt;.  0
                   to suppress entirely.
    &minus;d today       generate report for just today
    &minus;d yesterday   generate report for just &quot;yesterday&quot;
    &minus;&minus;deferral_detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Limit detailed deferral reports to the top &lt;cnt&gt;.  0
                   to suppress entirely.
    &minus;&minus;detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Sets all &minus;&minus;*_detail, &minus;h and &minus;u to &lt;cnt&gt;.  Is
                   over&minus;ridden by individual settings.  &minus;&minus;detail 0
                   suppresses *all* detail.
    &minus;e             extended (extreme? excessive?) detail
                   Emit detailed reports.  At present, this includes
                   only a per&minus;message report, sorted by sender domain,
                   then user&minus;in&minus;domain, then by queue i.d.
                   WARNING: the data built to generate this report can
                   quickly consume very large amounts of memory if a
                   lot of log entries are processed!
    &minus;h &lt;cnt&gt;       top &lt;cnt&gt; to display in host/domain reports.
                   0 = none.
                   See also: &quot;&minus;u&quot; and &quot;&minus;&minus;*_detail&quot; options for further
                             report&minus;limiting options.
    &minus;&minus;help         Emit short usage message and bail out.
                   (By happy coincidence, &quot;&minus;h&quot; alone does much the same,
                   being as it requires a numeric argument :&minus;).  Yeah, I
                   know: lame.)
    &minus;i
    &minus;&minus;ignore_case  Handle complete email address in a case&minus;insensitive
                   manner.
                   Normally pflogsumm lower&minus;cases only the host and
                   domain parts, leaving the user part alone.  This
                   option causes the entire email address to be lower&minus;
                   cased.
    &minus;&minus;iso_date_time
                   For summaries that contain date or time information,
                   use ISO 8601 standard formats (CCYY&minus;MM&minus;DD and HH:MM),
                   rather than &quot;Mon DD CCYY&quot; and &quot;HHMM&quot;.
    &minus;m             modify (mung?) UUCP&minus;style bang&minus;paths
    &minus;&minus;uucp_mung
                   This is for use when you have a mix of Internet&minus;style
                   domain addresses and UUCP&minus;style bang&minus;paths in the log.
                   Upstream UUCP feeds sometimes mung Internet domain
                   style address into bang&minus;paths.  This option can
                   sometimes undo the &quot;damage&quot;.  For example:
                   &quot;somehost.dom!username@foo&quot; (where &quot;foo&quot; is the next
                   host upstream and &quot;somehost.dom&quot; was whence the email
                   originated) will get converted to
                   &quot;foo!username@somehost.dom&quot;.  This also affects the
                   extended detail report (&minus;e), to help ensure that by&minus;
                    domain&minus;by&minus;name sorting is more accurate.
    &minus;&minus;mailq        Run &quot;mailq&quot; command at end of report.
                   Merely a convenience feature.  (Assumes that &quot;mailq&quot;
                   is in $PATH.  See &quot;$mailqCmd&quot; variable to path thisi
                   if desired.)
    &minus;&minus;no_bounce_detail
    &minus;&minus;no_deferral_detail
    &minus;&minus;no_reject_detail
                   These switches are depreciated in favour of
                   &minus;&minus;bounce_detail, &minus;&minus;deferral_detail and
                   &minus;&minus;reject_detail, respectively.
                   Suppresses the printing of the following detailed
                   reports, respectively:
                        message bounce detail (by relay)
                        message deferral detail
                        message reject detail
                   See also: &quot;&minus;u&quot; and &quot;&minus;h&quot; for further report&minus;limiting
                             options.
    &minus;&minus;no_no_msg_size
                    Do not emit report on &quot;Messages with no size data&quot;.
                    Message size is reported only by the queue manager.
                    The message may be delivered long&minus;enough after the
                    (last) qmgr log entry that the information is not in
                    the log(s) processed by a particular run of
                    pflogsumm.pl.  This throws off &quot;Recipients by message
                    size&quot; and the total for &quot;bytes delivered.&quot; These are
                    normally reported by pflogsumm as &quot;Messages with no
                    size data.&quot;
    &minus;&minus;no_smtpd_warnings
                   This switch is depreciated in favour of
                   smtpd_warning_detail
                    On a busy mail server, say at an ISP, SMTPD warnings
                    can result in a rather sizeable report.  This option
                    turns reporting them off.
    &minus;&minus;problems_first
                   Emit &quot;problems&quot; reports (bounces, defers, warnings,
                   etc.) before &quot;normal&quot; stats.
    &minus;&minus;rej_add_from
                   For those reject reports that list IP addresses or
                   host/domain names: append the email from address to
                   each listing.  (Does not apply to &quot;Improper use of
                   SMTP command pipelining&quot; report.)
    &minus;q             quiet &minus; don't print headings for empty reports
                   note: headings for warning, fatal, and &quot;master&quot;
                   messages will always be printed.
    &minus;&minus;reject_detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Limit detailed smtpd reject, warn, hold and discard
                   reports to the top &lt;cnt&gt;.  0 to suppress entirely.
    &minus;&minus;smtp_detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Limit detailed smtp delivery reports to the top &lt;cnt&gt;.
                   0 to suppress entirely.
    &minus;&minus;smtpd_stats
                   Generate smtpd connection statistics.
                   The &quot;per&minus;day&quot; report is not generated for single&minus;day
                   reports.  For multiple&minus;day reports: &quot;per&minus;hour&quot; numbers
                   are daily averages (reflected in the report heading).
    &minus;&minus;smtpd_warning_detail &lt;cnt&gt;
                   Limit detailed smtpd warnings reports to the top &lt;cnt&gt;.
                   0 to suppress entirely.
    &minus;&minus;syslog_name=name
                   Set syslog_name to look for for Postfix log entries.
                   By default, pflogsumm looks for entries in logfiles
                   with a syslog name of &quot;postfix,&quot; the default.
                   If you've set a non&minus;default &quot;syslog_name&quot; parameter
                   in your Postfix configuration, use this option to
                   tell pflogsumm what that is.
                   See the discussion about the use of this option under
                   &quot;NOTES,&quot; below.
    &minus;u &lt;cnt&gt;       top &lt;cnt&gt; to display in user reports. 0 == none.
                   See also: &quot;&minus;h&quot; and &quot;&minus;&minus;*_detail&quot; options for further
                             report&minus;limiting options.
    &minus;&minus;verbose_msg_detail
                   For the message deferral, bounce and reject summaries:
                   display the full &quot;reason&quot;, rather than a truncated one.
                   Note: this can result in quite long lines in the report.
    &minus;&minus;verp_mung    do &quot;VERP&quot; generated address (?) munging.  Convert
    &minus;&minus;verp_mung=2  sender addresses of the form
                   &quot;list&minus;return&minus;NN&minus;someuser=some.dom@host.sender.dom&quot;
                    to
                      &quot;list&minus;return&minus;ID&minus;someuser=some.dom@host.sender.dom&quot;
                    In other words: replace the numeric value with &quot;ID&quot;.
                   By specifying the optional &quot;=2&quot; (second form), the
                   munging is more &quot;aggressive&quot;, converting the address
                   to something like:
                        &quot;list&minus;return@host.sender.dom&quot;
                   Actually: specifying anything less than 2 does the
                   &quot;simple&quot; munging and anything greater than 1 results
                   in the more &quot;aggressive&quot; hack being applied.
                   See &quot;NOTES&quot; regarding this option.
    &minus;&minus;version      Print program name and version and bail out.
    &minus;&minus;zero_fill    &quot;Zero&minus;fill&quot; certain arrays so reports come out with
                   data in columns that that might otherwise be blank.</pre>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Pflogsumm makes no attempt to catch/parse non&minus;Postfix log
    entries.  Unless it has &quot;postfix/&quot; in the log entry, it will be
    ignored.
    It's important that the logs are presented to pflogsumm in
    chronological order so that message sizes are available when
    needed.
    For display purposes: integer values are munged into &quot;kilo&quot; and
    &quot;mega&quot; notation as they exceed certain values.  I chose the
    admittedly arbitrary boundaries of 512k and 512m as the points at
    which to do this&minus;&minus;my thinking being 512x was the largest number
    (of digits) that most folks can comfortably grok at&minus;a&minus;glance.
    These are &quot;computer&quot; &quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, not 1000 and 1,000,000.  You
    can easily change all of this with some constants near the
    beginning of the program.
    &quot;Items&minus;per&minus;day&quot; reports are not generated for single&minus;day
    reports.  For multiple&minus;day reports: &quot;Items&minus;per&minus;hour&quot; numbers are
    daily averages (reflected in the report headings).
    Message rejects, reject warnings, holds and discards are all
    reported under the &quot;rejects&quot; column for the Per&minus;Hour and Per&minus;Day
    traffic summaries.
    Verp munging may not always result in correct address and
    address&minus;count reduction.
    Verp munging is always in a state of experimentation.  The use
    of this option may result in inaccurate statistics with regards
    to the &quot;senders&quot; count.
    UUCP&minus;style bang&minus;path handling needs more work.  Particularly if
    Postfix is not being run with &quot;swap_bangpath = yes&quot; and/or *is* being
    run with &quot;append_dot_mydomain = yes&quot;, the detailed by&minus;message report
    may not be sorted correctly by&minus;domain&minus;by&minus;user.  (Also depends on
    upstream MTA, I suspect.)
    The &quot;percent rejected&quot; and &quot;percent discarded&quot; figures are only
    approximations.  They are calculated as follows (example is for
    &quot;percent rejected&quot;):
        percent rejected =
            (rejected / (delivered + rejected + discarded)) * 100
    There are some issues with the use of &minus;&minus;syslog_name.  The problem is
    that, even with $syslog_name set, Postfix will sometimes still log
    things with &quot;postfix&quot; as the syslog_name.  This is noted in
    /etc/postfix/sample&minus;misc.cf:
        # Beware: a non&minus;default syslog_name setting takes effect only
        # after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
        # logged with the default name, especially errors while parsing
        # the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
        # configuration file.
    As a consequence, pflogsumm must always look for &quot;postfix,&quot; in logs,
    as well as whatever is supplied for syslog_name.
    Where this becomes an issue is where people are running two or more
    instances of Postfix, logging to the same file.  In such a case:
        . Neither instance may use the default &quot;postfix&quot; syslog name
          and...
        . Log entries that fall victim to what's described in
          sample&minus;misc.cf will be reported under &quot;postfix&quot;, so that if
          you're running pflogsumm twice, once for each syslog_name, such
          log entries will show up in each report.

<h2>REQUIREMENTS
<a name="REQUIREMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    For certain options (e.g.: &minus;&minus;smtpd_stats), Pflogsumm requires the
    Date::Calc module, which can be obtained from CPAN at
    http://www.perl.com.
    Pflogsumm is currently written and tested under Perl 5.8.3.
    As of version 19990413&minus;02, pflogsumm worked with Perl 5.003, but
    future compatibility is not guaranteed.</pre>
