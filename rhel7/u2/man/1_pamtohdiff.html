convert PAM image to horizontal difference image</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtohdiff</b>
[<i>pamfile</i>] [<b>-verbose</b>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphens to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtohdiff</b>
takes a PAM (or PNM) image as input and produced a
horizontal difference image version of it as output. A
horizontal difference image is one where the samples in each
row indicate the difference between the sample value in the
corresponding sample of the input image and the sample
directly above it (in the previous row) in the input image.
The horizontal difference image has the property that if a
row of the original image is identical to the row above it
over a long extent, the corresponding row in the horizontal
difference image will contain all zeroes. That makes it
compress better than the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
horizontal difference samples can be positive or negative,
but PAM samples are unsigned integers, the samples in the
horizontal difference image PAM are defined to be the
difference modulus the range of the input (maxval + 1). This
doesn&rsquo;t lose any information, as it might seem,
because: of the two differences that could result in the
same <b>pamtohdiff</b> output value (e.g. if maxval is 99,
+20 and -80 would both result in &quot;20&quot; in the
output), only one is possible in context and the other would
result, when reconstructing the original image, in a value
less than 0 or greater than maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before the
modulus operation, the values <b>pamtohdiff</b> computes are
also biased by half the maxval. This is to make the results
easier to inspect visually. Because of the bias, you can
display the <b>pamtohdiff</b> output as if it were a PNM
image. As long as none of your differences are more than
half the maxval, large negative differences show up as dark
spots, smaller negative differences are lighter, zero
differences are medium intensity, and positive differences
are light. If you want this to work even for images that
have differences that exceed half the maxval, just use
<b>ppmdim 50</b> on the original image. To avoid losing
information, though, do a <b>pamdepth</b> to double the
maxval first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
because of the transfer function just described, a
difference of zero, which is most common, is represented by
a PAM sample value in the output of one half the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output PAM
has a tuple type of &quot;hdiff&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
<b>hdifftopam</b> to recover the original image from a
horizontal difference image PAM.</p>
