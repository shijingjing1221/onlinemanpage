lock a table</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LOCK [ TABLE ]
[ ONLY ] <i>name</i> [ * ] [, ...] [ IN <i>lockmode</i> MODE
] [ NOWAIT ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>lockmode</i> is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ACCESS SHARE |
ROW SHARE | ROW EXCLUSIVE | SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE <br>
| SHARE | SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE | EXCLUSIVE | ACCESS

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>LOCK
TABLE</b> obtains a table&minus;level lock, waiting if
necessary for any conflicting locks to be released. If
NOWAIT is specified, <b>LOCK TABLE</b> does not wait to
acquire the desired lock: if it cannot be acquired
immediately, the command is aborted and an error is emitted.
Once obtained, the lock is held for the remainder of the
current transaction. (There is no <b>UNLOCK TABLE</b>
command; locks are always released at transaction end.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When acquiring
locks automatically for commands that reference tables,
PostgreSQL always uses the least restrictive lock mode
possible. <b>LOCK TABLE</b> provides for cases when you
might need more restrictive locking. For example, suppose an
application runs a transaction at the Read Committed
isolation level and needs to ensure that data in a table
remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To
achieve this you could obtain SHARE lock mode over the table
before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes
and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view
of committed data, because SHARE lock mode conflicts with
the ROW EXCLUSIVE lock acquired by writers, and your <b>LOCK
TABLE</b> <i>name</i> <b>IN SHARE MODE</b> statement will
wait until any concurrent holders of ROW EXCLUSIVE mode
locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you obtain the lock,
there are no uncommitted writes outstanding; furthermore
none can begin until you release the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To achieve a
similar effect when running a transaction at the REPEATABLE
READ or SERIALIZABLE isolation level, you have to execute
the <b>LOCK TABLE</b> statement before executing any
<b>SELECT</b> or data modification statement. A REPEATABLE
READ or SERIALIZABLE transaction's view of data will be
frozen when its first <b>SELECT</b> or data modification
statement begins. A <b>LOCK TABLE</b> later in the
transaction will still prevent concurrent writes &mdash; but
it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds
to the latest committed values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the
table, then it should use SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE lock mode
instead of SHARE mode. This ensures that only one
transaction of this type runs at a time. Without this, a
deadlock is possible: two transactions might both acquire
SHARE mode, and then be unable to also acquire ROW EXCLUSIVE
mode to actually perform their updates. (Note that a
transaction's own locks never conflict, so a transaction can
acquire ROW EXCLUSIVE mode when it holds SHARE mode &mdash;
but not if anyone else holds SHARE mode.) To avoid
deadlocks, make sure all transactions acquire locks on the
same objects in the same order, and if multiple lock modes
are involved for a single object, then transactions should
always acquire the most restrictive mode first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More
information about the lock modes and locking strategies can
be found in Section 13.3, &ldquo;Explicit Locking&rdquo;, in
the documentation.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of an existing table to lock. If
ONLY is specified before the table name, only that table is
locked. If ONLY is not specified, the table and all its
descendant tables (if any) are locked. Optionally, * can be
specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that
descendant tables are included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The command
LOCK TABLE a, b; is equivalent to LOCK TABLE a; LOCK TABLE
b;. The tables are locked one&minus;by&minus;one in the
order specified in the <b>LOCK TABLE</b> command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>lockmode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The lock mode specifies which
locks this lock conflicts with. Lock modes are described in
Section 13.3, &ldquo;Explicit Locking&rdquo;, in the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no lock mode
is specified, then ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, the most restrictive
mode, is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NOWAIT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies that <b>LOCK
TABLE</b> should not wait for any conflicting locks to be
released: if the specified lock(s) cannot be acquired
immediately without waiting, the transaction is aborted.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LOCK TABLE ...
IN ACCESS SHARE MODE requires SELECT privileges on the
target table. All other forms of <b>LOCK</b> require
table&minus;level UPDATE, DELETE, or TRUNCATE
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>LOCK
TABLE</b> is useless outside a transaction block: the lock
would remain held only to the completion of the statement.
Therefore PostgreSQL reports an error if <b>LOCK</b> is used
outside a transaction block. Use <b>BEGIN</b>(7) and
<b>COMMIT</b>(7) (or <b>ROLLBACK</b>(7)) to define a
transaction block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>LOCK
TABLE</b> only deals with table&minus;level locks, and so
the mode names involving ROW are all misnomers. These mode
names should generally be read as indicating the intention
of the user to acquire row&minus;level locks within the
locked table. Also, ROW EXCLUSIVE mode is a sharable table
lock. Keep in mind that all the lock modes have identical
semantics so far as <b>LOCK TABLE</b> is concerned,
differing only in the rules about which modes conflict with
which. For information on how to acquire an actual
row&minus;level lock, see Section 13.3.2, &ldquo;Row-level
Locks&rdquo;, in the documentation and the FOR UPDATE/FOR
SHARE Clause in the <b>SELECT</b> reference
documentation.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obtain a SHARE
lock on a primary key table when going to perform inserts
into a foreign key table:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN WORK;
<br>
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE MODE; <br>
SELECT id FROM films <br>
WHERE name = 'Star Wars: Episode I &minus; The Phantom
Menace'; <br>
&minus;&minus; Do ROLLBACK if record was not returned <br>
INSERT INTO films_user_comments VALUES <br>
(_id_, 'GREAT! I was waiting for it for so long!'); <br>
COMMIT WORK;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Take a SHARE
ROW EXCLUSIVE lock on a primary key table when going to
perform a delete operation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN WORK;
<br>
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE; <br>
DELETE FROM films_user_comments WHERE id IN <br>
(SELECT id FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5); <br>
DELETE FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5; <br>
COMMIT WORK;</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
<b>LOCK TABLE</b> in the SQL standard, which instead uses
<b>SET TRANSACTION</b> to specify concurrency levels on
transactions. PostgreSQL supports that too; see SET
TRANSACTION (<b>SET_TRANSACTION</b>(7)) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except for
ACCESS SHARE, ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, and SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
lock modes, the PostgreSQL lock modes and the <b>LOCK
TABLE</b> syntax are compatible with those present in
Oracle.</p>
