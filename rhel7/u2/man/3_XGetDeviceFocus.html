<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
XSetDeviceFocus request changes the focus of the specified
<br>
device and its last&minus;focus&minus;change time. It has no
effect if the <br>
specified time is earlier than the current
last&minus;focus&minus;change <br>
time or is later than the current X server time. Otherwise,
the <br>
last&minus;focus&minus;change time is set to the specified
time CurrentTime <br>
is replaced by the current X server time). XSetDeviceFocus
<br>
causes the X server to generate DeviceFocusIn and <br>
DeviceFocusOut events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
the focus argument, the following occurs: <br>
* If focus is None , all device events are discarded until a
<br>
new focus window is set, and the revert_to argument is <br>
ignored. <br>
* If focus is a window, it becomes the device's focus
window. <br>
If a generated device event would normally be reported to
<br>
this window or one of its inferiors, the event is reported
<br>
as usual. Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the
<br>
focus window. <br>
* If focus is PointerRoot, the focus window is dynamically
<br>
taken to be the root window of whatever screen the pointer
<br>
is on at each event from the specified device. In this <br>
case, the revert_to argument is ignored. <br>
* If focus is FollowKeyboard, the focus window is
dynamically <br>
taken to be the window to which the X keyboard focus is set
<br>
at each input event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The specified
focus window must be viewable at the time <br>
XSetDeviceFocus is called, or a BadMatch error results. If
the <br>
focus window later becomes not viewable, the X server
evaluates <br>
the revert_to argument to determine the new focus window as
<br>
follows: <br>
* If revert_to is RevertToParent, the focus reverts to the
<br>
parent (or the closest viewable ancestor), and the new <br>
revert_to value is taken to be RevertToNone. <br>
* If revert_to is RevertToPointerRoot, <br>
RevertToFollowKeyboard, or RevertToNone, the focus reverts
<br>
to PointerRoot, FollowKeyboard, or None, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the focus
reverts, the X server generates DeviceFocusIn <br>
and DeviceFocusOut events, but the
last&minus;focus&minus;change time is <br>
not affected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Input extension
devices are not required to support the ability <br>
to be focused. Attempting to set the focus of a device that
<br>
does not support this request will result in a BadMatch
error. <br>
Whether or not given device can support this request can be
<br>
determined by the information returned by XOpenDevice. For
<br>
those devices that support focus, XOpenDevice will return an
<br>
XInputClassInfo structure with the input_class field equal
to <br>
the constant FocusClass (defined in the file XI.h).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XSetDeviceFocus
can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and <br>
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
XGetDeviceFocus request returns the focus window and the
<br>
current focus state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Not all input
extension devices can be focused. Attempting to <br>
query the focus state of a device that can't be focused
results <br>
in a BadMatch error. A device that can be focused returns
<br>
information for input Class Focus when an XOpenDevice
request <br>
is made.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XGetDeviceFocus
can generate BadDevice, and BadMatch errors.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadDevice <br>
An invalid device was specified. The specified device <br>
does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
<br>
XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the <br>
specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadValue <br>
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values <br>
accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is <br>
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
<br>
argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a <br>
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadWindow <br>
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined <br>
Window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadMatch <br>
This error may occur if an XGetDeviceFocus or <br>
XSetDeviceFocus request was made specifying a device <br>
that the server implementation does not allow to be <br>
 focused.</p>
