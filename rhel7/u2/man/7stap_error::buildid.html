<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
systemtap&rsquo;s script translation / execution stages may
be executed at different times and places, it is sometimes
necessary to verify certain invariants. One such invariant
is that if a script was informed by translate-time analysis
of executables, then those same executables need to be used
at run time. This checking is done based upon the build-id,
a binary hash that modern (post-2007) compilers/toolchains
add as an <i>NT_GNU_BUILD_ID</i> ELF note to object files
and executables. Use the <i>readelf -n</i> command to
examine the build-ids of binaries, if you are
interested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only scripts
are sensitive to executables&rsquo; build-ids: generally
those that perform deep analysis of the binaries or their
debuginfo. For example, scripts that place <i>.function</i>
or <i>.statement</i> probes, or use stack backtrace-related
tapset functions may be sensitive. Other scripts that rely
only on <i>process.mark</i> or <i>kernel.trace</i> probes do
not require debuginfo. See the DWARF DEBUGINFO section in
the <i>stapprobes</i>(3stap) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
translation, systemtap saves a copy of the relevant
files&rsquo; build-ids within the compiled modules. At
run-time, the modules compare the saved ones to the actual
run-time build-ids in memory. The error message indicates
that they did not match, so the module will decline placing
a probe that was computed based upon obsolete data. This is
important for safety, as placing them at an inappropriate
address could crash the programs. However, this is not
necessarily a fatal error, since probes unrelated to the
mismatching binaries may operate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A build-id
mismatch could be caused by a few different situations. The
main one is where the executable versions or architecture
were different between the systemtap translation and
execution times/places. For example, one may run a
stap-server on a slightly different version of the OS
distribution. Someone may have rebuilt a new kernel image,
but preserved the previous version numbers. The kernel
running on the workstation may be slightly different from
the version being targeted - perhaps due to a pending kernel
upgrade leaving different files on disk versus running in
memory. If your OS distribution uses separate debuginfo
packages, the split <i>.debug</i> files may not exactly
match the main binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable
build-id verification errors, if one is confident that they
are an artefact of build accidents rather than a real
mismatch, one might try the <i>-DSTP_NO_BUILDID_CHECK</i>
option.</p>
