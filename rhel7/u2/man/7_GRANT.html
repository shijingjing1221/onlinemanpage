<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>GRANT</b> command has two basic variants: one that grants
privileges on a database object (table, column, view,
foreign table, sequence, database, foreign&minus;data
wrapper, foreign server, function, procedural language,
schema, or tablespace), and one that grants membership in a
role. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are
different enough to be described separately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GRANT on
Database Objects</b> <br>
This variant of the <b>GRANT</b> command gives specific
privileges on a database object to one or more roles. These
privileges are added to those already granted, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also
an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same
type within one or more schemas. This functionality is
currently supported only for tables, sequences, and
functions (but note that ALL TABLES is considered to include
views and foreign tables).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The key word
PUBLIC indicates that the privileges are to be granted to
all roles, including those that might be created later.
PUBLIC can be thought of as an implicitly defined group that
always includes all roles. Any particular role will have the
sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted
to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges
granted to PUBLIC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If WITH GRANT
OPTION is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in
turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the
recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to
PUBLIC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually
the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges
by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some
of his own privileges for safety.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The right to
drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is
not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the
owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. (However, a similar
effect can be obtained by granting or revoking membership in
the role that owns the object; see below.) The owner
implicitly has all grant options for the object, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PostgreSQL
grants default privileges on some types of objects to
PUBLIC. No privileges are granted to PUBLIC by default on
tables, columns, schemas or tablespaces. For other types,
the default privileges granted to PUBLIC are as follows:
CONNECT and CREATE TEMP TABLE for databases; EXECUTE
privilege for functions; and USAGE privilege for languages.
The object owner can, of course, <b>REVOKE</b> both default
and expressly granted privileges. (For maximum security,
issue the <b>REVOKE</b> in the same transaction that creates
the object; then there is no window in which another user
can use the object.) Also, these initial default privilege
settings can be changed using the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
(<b>ALTER_DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES</b>(7)) command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The possible
privileges are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SELECT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows <b>SELECT</b>(7) from
any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified
table, view, or sequence. Also allows the use of
<b>COPY</b>(7) TO. This privilege is also needed to
reference existing column values in <b>UPDATE</b>(7) or
<b>DELETE</b>(7). For sequences, this privilege also allows
the use of the <b>currval</b> function. For large objects,
this privilege allows the object to be read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">INSERT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows <b>INSERT</b>(7) of a
new row into the specified table. If specific columns are
listed, only those columns may be assigned to in the
<b>INSERT</b> command (other columns will therefore receive
default values). Also allows <b>COPY</b>(7) FROM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UPDATE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows <b>UPDATE</b>(7) of any
column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified
table. (In practice, any nontrivial <b>UPDATE</b> command
will require SELECT privilege as well, since it must
reference table columns to determine which rows to update,
and/or to compute new values for columns.) SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE and SELECT ... FOR SHARE also require this privilege
on at least one column, in addition to the SELECT privilege.
For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the
<b>nextval</b> and <b>setval</b> functions. For large
objects, this privilege allows writing or truncating the
object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DELETE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows <b>DELETE</b>(7) of a
row from the specified table. (In practice, any nontrivial
<b>DELETE</b> command will require SELECT privilege as well,
since it must reference table columns to determine which
rows to delete.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TRUNCATE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows <b>TRUNCATE</b>(7) on
the specified table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REFERENCES</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a foreign key
constraint, it is necessary to have this privilege on both
the referencing and referenced columns. The privilege may be
granted for all columns of a table, or just specific
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TRIGGER</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows the creation of a
trigger on the specified table. (See the CREATE TRIGGER
(<b>CREATE_TRIGGER</b>(7)) statement.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For databases, allows new
schemas to be created within the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For schemas,
allows new objects to be created within the schema. To
rename an existing object, you must own the object
<i>and</i> have this privilege for the containing
schema.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For
tablespaces, allows tables, indexes, and temporary files to
be created within the tablespace, and allows databases to be
created that have the tablespace as their default
tablespace. (Note that revoking this privilege will not
alter the placement of existing objects.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CONNECT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows the user to connect to
the specified database. This privilege is checked at
connection startup (in addition to checking any restrictions
imposed by pg_hba.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TEMPORARY,
TEMP</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows temporary tables to be
created while using the specified database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">EXECUTE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows the use of the specified
function and the use of any operators that are implemented
on top of the function. This is the only type of privilege
that is applicable to functions. (This syntax works for
aggregate functions, as well.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">USAGE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For procedural languages,
allows the use of the specified language for the creation of
functions in that language. This is the only type of
privilege that is applicable to procedural languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For schemas,
allows access to objects contained in the specified schema
(assuming that the objects' own privilege requirements are
also met). Essentially this allows the grantee to
&ldquo;look up&rdquo; objects within the schema. Without
this permission, it is still possible to see the object
names, e.g. by querying the system tables. Also, after
revoking this permission, existing backends might have
statements that have previously performed this lookup, so
this is not a completely secure way to prevent object
access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For sequences,
this privilege allows the use of the <b>currval</b> and
<b>nextval</b> functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For types and
domains, this privilege allow the use of the type or domain
in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema
objects. (Note that it does not control general
&ldquo;usage&rdquo; of the type, such as values of the type
appearing in queries. It only prevents objects from being
created that depend on the type. The main purpose of the
privilege is controlling which users create dependencies on
a type, which could prevent the owner from changing the type
later.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For
foreign&minus;data wrappers, this privilege enables the
grantee to create new servers using that foreign&minus;data
wrapper.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For servers,
this privilege enables the grantee to create, alter, and
drop his own user's user mappings associated with that
server. Also, it enables the grantee to query the options of
the server and associated user mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ALL
PRIVILEGES</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Grant all of the available
privileges at once. The PRIVILEGES key word is optional in
PostgreSQL, though it is required by strict SQL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The privileges required by
other commands are listed on the reference page of the
respective command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GRANT on
Roles</b> <br>
This variant of the <b>GRANT</b> command grants membership
in a role to one or more other roles. Membership in a role
is significant because it conveys the privileges granted to
a role to each of its members.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If WITH ADMIN
OPTION is specified, the member can in turn grant membership
in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as
well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do
that. A role is not considered to hold WITH ADMIN OPTION on
itself, but it may grant or revoke membership in itself from
a database session where the session user matches the role.
Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any
role to anyone. Roles having CREATEROLE privilege can grant
or revoke membership in any role that is not a
superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the case
with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted to
PUBLIC. Note also that this form of the command does not
allow the noise word GROUP.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>REVOKE</b>(7) command is used to revoke access
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
PostgreSQL 8.1, the concepts of users and groups have been
unified into a single kind of entity called a role. It is
therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword GROUP to
identify whether a grantee is a user or a group. GROUP is
still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A user may
perform <b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, etc. on a column if he
holds that privilege for either the specific column or its
whole table. Granting the privilege at the table level and
then revoking it for one column will not do what you might
wish: the table&minus;level grant is unaffected by a
column&minus;level operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
non&minus;owner of an object attempts to <b>GRANT</b>
privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if
the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long
as some privilege is available, the command will proceed,
but it will grant only those privileges for which the user
has grant options. The <b>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES</b> forms
will issue a warning message if no grant options are held,
while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options
for any of the privileges specifically named in the command
are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the
object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated
as holding all grant options, the cases can never
occur.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should be
noted that database superusers can access all objects
regardless of object privilege settings. This is comparable
to the rights of root in a Unix system. As with root, it's
unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a superuser
chooses to issue a <b>GRANT</b> or <b>REVOKE</b> command,
the command is performed as though it were issued by the
owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges
granted via such a command will appear to have been granted
by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership
appears to have been granted by the containing role
itself.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GRANT</b>
and <b>REVOKE</b> can also be done by a role that is not the
owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role
that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds
privileges WITH GRANT OPTION on the object. In this case the
privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the
role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges
WITH GRANT OPTION. For example, if table t1 is owned by role
g1, of which role u1 is a member, then u1 can grant
privileges on t1 to u2, but those privileges will appear to
have been granted directly by g1. Any other member of role
g1 could revoke them later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the role
executing <b>GRANT</b> holds the required privileges
indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is
unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having
done the grant. In such cases it is best practice to use
<b>SET ROLE</b> to become the specific role you want to do
the <b>GRANT</b> as.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Granting
permission on a table does not automatically extend
permissions to any sequences used by the table, including
sequences tied to SERIAL columns. Permissions on sequences
must be set separately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>psql</b>(1)'s <b>\dp</b> command to obtain information
about existing privileges for tables and columns. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">=&gt; \dp

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
non&minus;table objects there are other <b>\d</b> commands
that can display their privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&ldquo;Access privileges&rdquo; column is empty for a given
object, it means the object has default privileges (that is,
its privileges column is null). Default privileges always
include all privileges for the owner, and can include some
privileges for PUBLIC depending on the object type, as
explained above. The first <b>GRANT</b> or <b>REVOKE</b> on
an object will instantiate the default privileges
(producing, for example, {miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}) and then
modify them per the specified request. Similarly, entries
are shown in &ldquo;Column access privileges&rdquo; only for
columns with nondefault privileges. (Note: for this purpose,
&ldquo;default privileges&rdquo; always means the
built&minus;in default privileges for the object's type. An
object whose privileges have been affected by an <b>ALTER
DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</b> command will always be shown with an
explicit privilege entry that includes the effects of the
<b>ALTER</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that the
owner's implicit grant options are not marked in the access
privileges display. A * will appear only when grant options
have been explicitly granted to someone.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Grant insert

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">GRANT INSERT ON

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">GRANT ALL

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that while
the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a
superuser or the owner of kinds, when executed by someone
else it will only grant those permissions for which the
someone else has grant options.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
the SQL standard, the PRIVILEGES key word in ALL PRIVILEGES
is required. The SQL standard does not support setting the
privileges on more than one object per command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PostgreSQL
allows an object owner to revoke his own ordinary
privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table
read&minus;only to himself by revoking his own INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE privileges. This is not
possible according to the SQL standard. The reason is that
PostgreSQL treats the owner's privileges as having been
granted by the owner to himself; therefore he can revoke
them too. In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are
granted by an assumed entity &ldquo;_SYSTEM&rdquo;. Not
being &ldquo;_SYSTEM&rdquo;, the owner cannot revoke these
rights.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">According to
the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to PUBLIC;
PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options to
roles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL
standard provides for a USAGE privilege on other kinds of
objects: character sets, collations, translations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the SQL
standard, sequences only have a USAGE privilege, which
controls the use of the NEXT VALUE FOR expression, which is
equivalent to the function <b>nextval</b> in PostgreSQL. The
sequence privileges SELECT and UPDATE are PostgreSQL
extensions. The application of the sequence USAGE privilege
to the currval function is also a PostgreSQL extension (as
is the function itself).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Privileges on
databases, tablespaces, schemas, and languages are
PostgreSQL extensions.</p>
