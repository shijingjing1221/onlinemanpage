<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The XGrabDevice
request actively grabs control of the device <br>
and generates DeviceFocusIn and DeviceFocusOut events.
Further <br>
device events are reported only to the grabbing <br>
client.XGrabDevice overrides any active device grab by this
<br>
client. event_list is a pointer to a list of event classes.
<br>
This list indicates which events the client wishes to
receive <br>
while the grab is active. If owner_events is False, all <br>
generated device events are reported with respect to <br>
grab_window if selected. If owner_events is True and if a
<br>
generated device event would normally be reported to this
<br>
client, it is reported normally; otherwise, the event is
<br>
reported with respect to the grab_window, and is only
reported <br>
if specified in the event_list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
this_device_mode argument is GrabModeAsync, device event
<br>
processing continues as usual. If the device is currently
<br>
frozen by this client, then processing of device events is
<br>
resumed. If the this_device_mode argument is GrabModeSync,
the <br>
state of the device (as seen by client applications) appears
to <br>
freeze, and the X server generates no further device events
<br>
until the grabbing client issues a releasing
XAllowDeviceEvents <br>
call or until the device grab is released. Actual device
<br>
changes are not lost while the device is frozen; they are
<br>
simply queued in the server for later processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
other_devices_mode is GrabModeAsync, processing of events
<br>
from other devices is unaffected by activation of the grab.
If <br>
other_devices_mode is GrabModeSync, the state of all devices
<br>
except the grabbed device (as seen by client applications)
<br>
appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further
events <br>
from those devices until the grabbing client issues a
releasing <br>
XAllowDeviceEvents call or until the device grab is
released. <br>
Actual events are not lost while the devices are frozen;
they <br>
are simply queued in the server for later processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the device
is actively grabbed by some other client, <br>
XGrabDevice fails and returns AlreadyGrabbed. If grab_window
is <br>
not viewable, it fails and returns GrabNotViewable. If the
<br>
device is frozen by an active grab of another client, it
fails <br>
and returns GrabFrozen. If the specified time is earlier
than <br>
the last&minus;device&minus;grab time or later than the
current X server <br>
time, it fails and returns GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the
<br>
last&minus;device&minus;grab time is set to the specified
time ( <br>
CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server time).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a grabbed
device is closed by a client while an active grab <br>
by that client is in effect, the active grab is released. If
<br>
the device is frozen only by an active grab of the
requesting <br>
client, it is thawed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XGrabDevice can
generate BadClass, BadDevice, BadValue, and <br>
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
XUngrabDevice request releases the device and any queued
<br>
events if this client has it actively grabbed from either
<br>
XGrabDevice or XGrabDeviceKey. If other devices are frozen
by <br>
the grab, XUngrabDevice thaws them.XUngrabDevice does not
<br>
release the device and any queued events if the specified
time <br>
is earlier than the last&minus;device&minus;grab time or is
later than the <br>
current X server time. It also generates DeviceFocusIn and
<br>
DeviceFocusOut events. The X server automatically performs
an <br>
UngrabDevice request if the event window for an active
device <br>
grab becomes not viewable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XUngrabDevice
can generate a BadDevice error.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadDevice <br>
An invalid device was specified. The specified device <br>
does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
<br>
XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the <br>
specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadValue <br>
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values <br>
accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is <br>
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
<br>
argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a <br>
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadWindow <br>
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined <br>
Window.</p>
