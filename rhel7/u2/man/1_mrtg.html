<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Multi
Router Traffic Grapher ( <small>MRTG</small> ) is a tool to
monitor the traffic load on network links.
<small>MRTG</small> generates <small>HTML</small> pages
containing <small>PNG</small> images which provide a
<small>LIVE</small> visual representation of this traffic.

<h2>HIGHLIGHTS
<a name="HIGHLIGHTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> works on
most <small>UNIX</small> platforms and Windows
<small>NT</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> is written
in Perl and comes with full source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Portable
<small>SNMP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> Uses a
highly portable <small>SNMP</small> implementation written
entirely in Perl (thanks to Simon Leinen). There is no need
to install any external <small>SNMP</small> package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SNMPv2c support</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> can read
the new SNMPv2c 64bit counters. No more counter
wrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reliable Interface
Identification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Router interfaces can be
identified by <small>IP</small> address, description and
ethernet address in addition to the normal interface
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant size Logfiles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> &rsquo;s
logfiles do <small>NOT</small> grow thanks to the use of a
unique data consolidation algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Automatic Configuration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> comes with
a set of configuration tools which make configuration and
setup very simple.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Performance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Time critical routines are
written in C (thanks to the initiative of Dave Rand my
Co-Author).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>GIF</small> free
Graphics</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Graphics are generated directly
in <small>PNG</small> format using the <small>GD</small>
library by Thomas Boutell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Customizability</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The look of the webpages
produced by <small>MRTG</small> is highly configurable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">RRDtool</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MRTG</small> has
built-in hooks for using RRDtool. If you are strapped for
performance this may help.</p>

<h2>DETAILS
<a name="DETAILS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>MRTG</small>
consists of a Perl script which uses <small>SNMP</small> to
read the traffic counters of your routers and a fast C
program which logs the traffic data and creates beautiful
graphs representing the traffic on the monitored network
connection. These graphs are embedded into webpages which
can be viewed from any modern Web-browser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
a detailed daily view, <small>MRTG</small> also creates
visual representations of the traffic seen during the last
seven days, the last five weeks and the last twelve months.
This is possible because <small>MRTG</small> keeps a log of
all the data it has pulled from the router. This log is
automatically consolidated so that it does not grow over
time, but still contains all the relevant data for all the
traffic seen over the last two years. This is all performed
in an efficient manner. Therefore you can monitor 200 or
more network links from any halfway decent
<small>UNIX</small> box.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>MRTG</small>
is not limited to monitoring traffic, though. It is possible
to monitor any <small>SNMP</small> variable you choose. You
can even use an external program to gather the data which
should be monitored via <small>MRTG</small> . People are
using <small>MRTG</small> , to monitor things such as System
Load, Login Sessions, Modem availability and more.
<small>MRTG</small> even allows you to accumulate two or
more data sources into a single graph.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 1994 I was
working at a site where we had one 64kbit line to the
outside world. Obviously, everybody was interested in
knowing how the link was performing. So I wrote a quick hack
which created a constantly updated graph on the web that
showed the traffic load on our Internet link. This
eventually evolved into a rather configurable Perl script
called <small>MRTG&minus;1</small> .0 which I released in
spring 1995. After a few updates, I left my job at
<small>DMU</small> to start work at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology. Due to lack of time I had to put
<small>MRTG</small> aside. One day in January of 1996, I
received email from Dave Rand asking if I had any ideas why
<small>MRTG</small> was so slow. Actually, I did.
<small>MRTG</small> &rsquo;s programming was not very
efficient and it was written entirely in Perl. After a week
or so, Dave wrote back to me and said he had tried what I
had suggested for improving <small>MRTG</small> &rsquo;s
speed. Since the changes did not help much, he had decided
to rewrite the time-critical sections of <small>MRTG</small>
in C. The code was attached to his email. His tool increased
the speed of <small>MRTG</small> by a factor of 40! This got
me out of my &rsquo; <small>MRTG</small> ignorance&rsquo;
and I started to spend my spare time developing of
<small>MRTG&minus;2</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Soon after
<small>MRTG&minus;2</small> development had begun I started
to give beta copies to interested parties. In return I got
many feature patches, a lot of user feedback and bug fixes.
The product you are getting now wouldn&rsquo;t be in this
state if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the great contributions
and support I received from of many people. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank them all. (See the files
<small>CHANGES</small> for a long list of folk people who
helped to make <small>MRTG</small> what it is today.)</p>

<h2>Command-line
<a name="Command-line"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mrtg is also
the name of the script you have to run to poll data and
generate the graphs. Most configuration is set through the
configuration file; some command-line options exist all the
same. <b><br>
&minus;&minus;user</b> <i>username</i> and
<b>&minus;&minus;group</b> <i>groupname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Run as the given user and/or
group. (Unix Only)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;lock&minus;file</b>
<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use an alternate lock-file (the
default is to use the configuration-file appended with
<tt>&quot;_l&quot;</tt>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;confcache&minus;file</b>
<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use an alternate confcache-file
(the default is to use the configuration-file appended with
<tt>&quot;.ok&quot;</tt>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;logging</b>
<i>filename</i>|<b>eventlog</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this is set to writable
filename, all output from mrtg (warnings, debug messages,
errors) will go to <i>filename</i>. If you are running on
Win32 you can specify <b>eventlog</b> instead of a filename
which will send all error to the windows event log.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
Note, there is no Message <small>DLL</small> for mrtg. This
has the side effect that the windows event logger will
display a nice message with every entry in the event log,
complaing about the fact that mrtg has no message dll. If
any of the Windows folks want to contribute one, they are
welcome.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;daemon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Put <small>MRTG</small> into
the background, running as a daemon. This works the same way
as the config file option, but the switch is required for
proper <small>FHS</small> operation (because /var/run is
writable only by root)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fhs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configure all mrtg paths to
conform to the <small>FHS</small> specification;
http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only check the cfg file for
errors. Do not do anything.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;pid&minus;file=s</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Define the name and path of the
pid file for mrtg running as a daemon</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only update the logfile, do not
produce graphics or html pages</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;debug=s</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable debug options. The
argument of the debug option is a comma separated list of
debug values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> cfg  &minus; watch the config file reading
 dir  &minus; directory mangeling
 base &minus; basic program flow
 tarp &minus; target parser
 snpo &minus; snmp polling
 fork &minus; forking view
 time &minus; some timing info
 log  &minus; logging of data via rateup or rrdtool</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> &minus;&minus;debug=&quot;cfg,snpo&quot;</pre>
