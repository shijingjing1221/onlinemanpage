<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">urb_list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For use by current owner of the
URB.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">anchor_list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">membership in the list of an
anchor</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">anchor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">to anchor URBs to a common
mooring</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dev</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Identifies the USB device to
perform the request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Points to the endpoint's data
structure. Will eventually replace <i>pipe</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pipe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Holds endpoint number,
direction, type, and more. Create these values with the
eight macros available; usb_{snd,rcv}TYPEpipe(dev,endpoint),
where the TYPE is &ldquo;ctrl&rdquo; (control),
&ldquo;bulk&rdquo;, &ldquo;int&rdquo; (interrupt), or
&ldquo;iso&rdquo; (isochronous). For example
<b>usb_sndbulkpipe</b> or <b>usb_rcvintpipe</b>. Endpoint
numbers range from zero to fifteen. Note that
&ldquo;in&rdquo; endpoint two is a different endpoint (and
pipe) from &ldquo;out&rdquo; endpoint two. The current
configuration controls the existence, type, and maximum
packet size of any given endpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">stream_id</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the endpoint's stream ID for
bulk streams</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is read in non&minus;iso
completion functions to get the status of the particular
request. ISO requests only use it to tell whether the URB
was unlinked; detailed status for each frame is in the
fields of the iso_frame&minus;desc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">transfer_flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A variety of flags may be used
to affect how URB submission, unlinking, or operation are
handled. Different kinds of URB can use different flags.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">transfer_buffer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This identifies the buffer to
(or from) which the I/O request will be performed unless
URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP is set (however, do not leave
garbage in transfer_buffer even then). This buffer must be
suitable for DMA; allocate it with <b>kmalloc</b> or
equivalent. For transfers to &ldquo;in&rdquo; endpoints,
contents of this buffer will be modified. This buffer is
used for the data stage of control transfers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">transfer_dma</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When transfer_flags includes
URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP, the device driver is saying that it
provided this DMA address, which the host controller driver
should use in preference to the transfer_buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">scatter gather buffer list, the
buffer size of each element in the list (except the last)
must be divisible by the endpoint's max packet size if
no_sg_constraint isn't set in 'struct usb_bus'</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">num_mapped_sgs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(internal) number of mapped sg
entries</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">num_sgs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">number of entries in the sg
list</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">transfer_buffer_length</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How big is transfer_buffer. The
transfer may be broken up into chunks according to the
current maximum packet size for the endpoint, which is a
function of the configuration and is encoded in the pipe.
When the length is zero, neither transfer_buffer nor
transfer_dma is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">actual_length</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is read in non&minus;iso
completion functions, and it tells how many bytes (out of
transfer_buffer_length) were transferred. It will normally
be the same as requested, unless either an error was
reported or a short read was performed. The URB_SHORT_NOT_OK
transfer flag may be used to make such short reads be
reported as errors.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">setup_packet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only used for control
transfers, this points to eight bytes of setup data. Control
transfers always start by sending this data to the device.
Then transfer_buffer is read or written, if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">setup_dma</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">DMA pointer for the setup
packet. The caller must not use this field; setup_packet
must point to a valid buffer.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">start_frame</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns the initial frame for
isochronous transfers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">number_of_packets</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Lists the number of ISO
transfer buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">interval</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the polling interval
for interrupt or isochronous transfers. The units are frames
(milliseconds) for full and low speed devices, and
microframes (1/8 millisecond) for highspeed and SuperSpeed
devices.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">error_count</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns the number of ISO
transfers that reported errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For use in completion
functions. This normally points to request&minus;specific
driver context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">complete</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Completion handler. This URB is
passed as the parameter to the completion function. The
completion function may then do what it likes with the URB,
including resubmitting or freeing it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">iso_frame_desc[0]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used to provide arrays of ISO
transfer buffers and to collect the transfer status for each
buffer.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This structure
identifies USB transfer requests. URBs must be allocated by
calling <b>usb_alloc_urb</b> and freed with a call to
<b>usb_free_urb</b>. Initialization may be done using
various usb_fill_*<b>_urb</b> functions. URBs are submitted
using <b>usb_submit_urb</b>, and pending requests may be
canceled using <b>usb_unlink_urb</b> or
<b>usb_kill_urb</b>.</p>

<h2>DATA TRANSFER BUFFERS
<a name="DATA TRANSFER BUFFERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
drivers provide I/O buffers allocated with <b>kmalloc</b> or
otherwise taken from the general page pool. That is provided
by transfer_buffer (control requests also use setup_packet),
and host controller drivers perform a dma mapping (and
unmapping) for each buffer transferred. Those mapping
operations can be expensive on some platforms (perhaps using
a dma bounce buffer or talking to an IOMMU), although
they're cheap on commodity x86 and ppc hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
drivers may pass the URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP transfer flag,
which tells the host controller driver that no such mapping
is needed for the transfer_buffer since the device driver is
DMA&minus;aware. For example, a device driver might allocate
a DMA buffer with <b>usb_alloc_coherent</b> or call
<b>usb_buffer_map</b>. When this transfer flag is provided,
host controller drivers will attempt to use the dma address
found in the transfer_dma field rather than determining a
dma address themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
transfer_buffer must still be set if the controller does not
support DMA (as indicated by bus.uses_dma) and when talking
to root hub. If you have to trasfer between highmem zone and
the device on such controller, create a bounce buffer or
bail out with an error. If transfer_buffer cannot be set (is
in highmem) and the controller is DMA capable, assign NULL
to it, so that usbmon knows not to use the value. The
setup_packet must always be set, so it cannot be located in
highmem.</p>

<h2>INITIALIZATION
<a name="INITIALIZATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All URBs
submitted must initialize the dev, pipe, transfer_flags (may
be zero), and complete fields. All URBs must also initialize
transfer_buffer and transfer_buffer_length. They may provide
the URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag, indicating that short
reads are to be treated as errors; that flag is invalid for
write requests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bulk URBs may
use the URB_ZERO_PACKET transfer flag, indicating that bulk
OUT transfers should always terminate with a short packet,
even if it means adding an extra zero length packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Control URBs
must provide a valid pointer in the setup_packet field.
Unlike the transfer_buffer, the setup_packet may not be
mapped for DMA beforehand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interrupt URBs
must provide an interval, saying how often (in milliseconds
or, for highspeed devices, 125 microsecond units) to poll
for transfers. After the URB has been submitted, the
interval field reflects how the transfer was actually
scheduled. The polling interval may be more frequent than
requested. For example, some controllers have a maximum
interval of 32 milliseconds, while others support intervals
of up to 1024 milliseconds. Isochronous URBs also have
transfer intervals. (Note that for isochronous endpoints, as
well as high speed interrupt endpoints, the encoding of the
transfer interval in the endpoint descriptor is logarithmic.
Device drivers must convert that value to linear units
themselves.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an
isochronous endpoint queue isn't already running, the host
controller will schedule a new URB to start as soon as
bandwidth utilization allows. If the queue is running then a
new URB will be scheduled to start in the first transfer
slot following the end of the preceding URB, if that slot
has not already expired. If the slot has expired (which can
happen when IRQ delivery is delayed for a long time), the
scheduling behavior depends on the URB_ISO_ASAP flag. If the
flag is clear then the URB will be scheduled to start in the
expired slot, implying that some of its packets will not be
transferred; if the flag is set then the URB will be
scheduled in the first unexpired slot, breaking the queue's
synchronization. Upon URB completion, the start_frame field
will be set to the (micro)frame number in which the transfer
was scheduled. Ranges for frame counter values are
HC&minus;specific and can go from as low as 256 to as high
as 65536 frames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Isochronous
URBs have a different data transfer model, in part because
the quality of service is only &ldquo;best effort&rdquo;.
Callers provide specially allocated URBs, with
number_of_packets worth of iso_frame_desc structures at the
end. Each such packet is an individual ISO transfer.
Isochronous URBs are normally queued, submitted by drivers
to arrange that transfers are at least double buffered, and
then explicitly resubmitted in completion handlers, so that
data (such as audio or video) streams at as constant a rate
as the host controller scheduler can support.</p>

<h2>COMPLETION CALLBACKS
<a name="COMPLETION CALLBACKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The completion
callback is made <b>in_interrupt</b>, and one of the first
things that a completion handler should do is check the
status field. The status field is provided for all URBs. It
is used to report unlinked URBs, and status for all
non&minus;ISO transfers. It should not be examined before
the URB is returned to the completion handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The context
field is normally used to link URBs back to the relevant
driver or request state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
completion callback is invoked for non&minus;isochronous
URBs, the actual_length field tells how many bytes were
transferred. This field is updated even when the URB
terminated with an error or was unlinked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ISO transfer
status is reported in the status and actual_length fields of
the iso_frame_desc array, and the number of errors is
reported in error_count. Completion callbacks for ISO
transfers will normally (re)submit URBs to ensure a constant
transfer rate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that even
fields marked &ldquo;public&rdquo; should not be touched by
the driver when the urb is owned by the hcd, that is, since
the call to <b>usb_submit_urb</b> till the entry into the
completion routine.</p>
