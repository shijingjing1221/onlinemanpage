<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
&minus; framework for localization</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  package MyProgram;
  use strict;
  use MyProgram::L10N;
   # ...which inherits from Locale::Maketext
  my $lh = MyProgram::L10N&minus;&gt;get_handle() || die &quot;What language?&quot;;
  ...
  # And then any messages your program emits, like:
  warn $lh&minus;&gt;maketext( &quot;Can't open file [_1]: [_2]\n&quot;, $f, $! );
  ...</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a common
feature of applications (whether run directly, or via the
Web) for them to be &quot;localized&quot; -- i.e., for them
to a present an English interface to an English-speaker, a
German interface to a German-speaker, and so on for all
languages it&rsquo;s programmed with. Locale::Maketext is a
framework for software localization; it provides you with
the tools for organizing and accessing the bits of text and
text-processing code that you need for producing localized
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
make sense of Maketext and how all its components fit
together, you should probably go read
Locale::Maketext::TPJ13, and <i>then</i> read the following
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
want to read over the source for
<tt>&quot;File::Findgrep&quot;</tt> and its constituent
modules -- they are a complete (if small) example
application that uses Maketext.</p>

<h2>QUICK OVERVIEW
<a name="QUICK OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
design of Locale::Maketext is object-oriented, and
Locale::Maketext is an abstract base class, from which you
derive a &quot;project class&quot;. The project class (with
a name like &quot;TkBocciBall::Localize&quot;, which you
then use in your module) is in turn the base class for all
the &quot;language classes&quot; for your project (with
names &quot;TkBocciBall::Localize::it&quot;,
&quot;TkBocciBall::Localize::en&quot;,
&quot;TkBocciBall::Localize::fr&quot;, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A language
class is a class containing a lexicon of phrases as class
data, and possibly also some methods that are of use in
interpreting phrases in the lexicon, or otherwise dealing
with text in that language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An object
belonging to a language class is called a &quot;language
handle&quot;; it&rsquo;s typically a flyweight object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The normal
course of action is to call:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use TkBocciBall::Localize;  # the localization project class
  $lh = TkBocciBall::Localize&minus;&gt;get_handle();
   # Depending on the user's locale, etc., this will
   # make a language handle from among the classes available,
   # and any defaults that you declare.
  die &quot;Couldn't make a language handle??&quot; unless $lh;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From then on,
you use the <tt>&quot;maketext&quot;</tt> function to access
entries in whatever lexicon(s) belong to the language handle
you got. So, this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  print $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(&quot;You won!&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...emits the
right text for this language. If the object in <tt>$lh</tt>
belongs to class &quot;TkBocciBall::Localize::fr&quot; and
<tt>%TkBocciBall::Localize::fr::Lexicon</tt> contains
<tt>&quot;(&quot;You won!&quot; =&gt; &quot;Tu as
gagne!&quot;)&quot;</tt>, then the above code happily tells
the user &quot;Tu as gagne!&quot;.</p>

<h2>METHODS
<a name="METHODS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
offers a variety of methods, which fall into three
categories:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

handle.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Methods that you may find it handy to use, from routines
of yours that you put in <tt>%Lexicon</tt> entries.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
covered in the following section.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Construction
Methods</b> <br>
These are to do with constructing a language handle:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt>$lh</tt> =
YourProjClass&minus;&gt;get_handle( ...langtags... ) || die
&quot;lg-handle?&quot;;</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This tries
loading classes based on the language-tags you give (like
<tt>&quot;(&quot;en&minus;US&quot;, &quot;sk&quot;,
&quot;kon&quot;, &quot;es&minus;MX&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;,
&quot;i&minus;klingon&quot;)&quot;</tt>, and for the first
class that succeeds, returns
YourProjClass::<i>language</i>&minus;&gt;<i>new()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If it runs thru
the entire given list of language-tags, and finds no classes
for those exact terms, it then tries
&quot;superordinate&quot; language classes. So if no
&quot;en-US&quot; class (i.e., YourProjClass::en_us) was
found, nor classes for anything else in that list, we then
try its superordinate, &quot;en&quot; (i.e.,
YourProjClass::en), and so on thru the other language-tags
in the given list: &quot;es&quot;. (The other language-tags
in our example list: happen to have no superordinates.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If none of
those language-tags leads to loadable classes, we then try
classes derived from
YourProjClass&minus;&gt;<i>fallback_languages()</i> and then
if nothing comes of that, we use classes named by
YourProjClass&minus;&gt;<i>fallback_language_classes()</i>.
Then in the (probably quite unlikely) event that that fails,
we just return undef.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt>$lh</tt> =
YourProjClass&minus;&gt;get_handle<b>()</b> || die
&quot;lg-handle?&quot;;</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt> is called with an empty
parameter list, magic happens:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt> senses that it&rsquo;s
running in program that was invoked as a <small>CGI,</small>
then it tries to get language-tags out of the environment
variable &quot; <small>HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE&quot;,</small>
and it pretends that those were the languages passed as
parameters to <tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise
(i.e., if not a <small>CGI</small> ), this tries various
OS-specific ways to get the language-tags for the current
locale/language, and then pretends that those were the
value(s) passed to <tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently this
OS-specific stuff consists of looking in the environment
variables &quot; <small>LANG&quot;</small> and &quot;
<small>LANGUAGE&quot;</small> ; and on MSWin machines (where
those variables are typically unused), this also tries using
the module Win32::Locale to get a language-tag for whatever
language/locale is currently selected in the &quot;Regional
Settings&quot; (or &quot;International&quot;?) Control
Panel. I welcome further suggestions for making this do the
Right Thing under other operating systems that support
localization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
using localization in an application that keeps a
configuration file, you might consider something like this
in your project class:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  sub get_handle_via_config {
    my $class = $_[0];
    my $chosen_language = $Config_settings{'language'};
    my $lh;
    if($chosen_language) {
      $lh = $class&minus;&gt;get_handle($chosen_language)
       || die &quot;No language handle for \&quot;$chosen_language\&quot;&quot;
            . &quot; or the like&quot;;
    } else {
      # Config file missing, maybe?
      $lh = $class&minus;&gt;get_handle()
       || die &quot;Can't get a language handle&quot;;
    }
    return $lh;
  }</pre>



<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt>$lh</tt> =
YourProjClass::langname&minus;&gt;<i>new()</i>;</p> </td>
<td width="26%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This constructs
a language handle. You usually <b>don&rsquo;t</b> call this
directly, but instead let <tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>
find a language class to <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> and to
then call &minus;&gt;new on.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="18%">



<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;<i>init()</i>;</p> </td>
<td width="65%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is called
by &minus;&gt;new to initialize newly-constructed language
handles. If you define an init method in your class,
remember that it&rsquo;s usually considered a good idea to
call <tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;SUPER::init in it (presumably at
the beginning), so that all classes get a chance to
initialize a new object however they see fit.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="29%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>
appends the return value of this to the end of whatever list
of languages you pass <tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>.
Unless you override this method, your project class will
inherit Locale::Maketext&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;fallback_languages&quot;</tt>, which currently
returns <tt>&quot;('i&minus;default', 'en',
'en&minus;US')&quot;</tt>. (&quot;i&minus;default&quot; is
defined in <small>RFC 2277</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This method (by
having it return the name of a language-tag that has an
existing language class) can be used for making sure that
<tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt> will always manage to
construct a language handle (assuming your language classes
are in an appropriate <tt>@INC</tt> directory). Or you can
use the next method:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="65%">



<p style="margin-top: 1em">YourProjClass&minus;&gt;<i>fallback_language_classes()</i></p> </td>
<td width="18%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>
appends the return value of this to the end of the list of
classes it will try using. Unless you override this method,
your project class will inherit Locale::Maketext&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;fallback_language_classes&quot;</tt>, which
currently returns an empty list, <tt>&quot;()&quot;</tt>. By
setting this to some value (namely, the name of a loadable
language class), you can be sure that
<tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt> will always manage to
construct a language handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;maketext&quot; Method</b> <br>
This is the most important method in Locale::Maketext:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $text = $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(I&lt;key&gt;, ...parameters for this phrase...);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This looks in
the <tt>%Lexicon</tt> of the language handle <tt>$lh</tt>
and all its superclasses, looking for an entry whose key is
the string <i>key</i>. Assuming such an entry is found,
various things then happen, depending on the value
found:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a scalarref, the scalar is dereferenced and returned (and
any parameters are ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a coderef, we return &amp;$value($lh, ...parameters...).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a string that <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> look like it&rsquo;s in
Bracket Notation, we return it (after replacing it with a
scalarref, in its <tt>%Lexicon</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value
<i>does</i> look like it&rsquo;s in Bracket Notation, then
we compile it into a sub, replace the string in the
<tt>%Lexicon</tt> with the new coderef, and then we return
&amp;$new_sub($lh, ...parameters...).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket
Notation is discussed in a later section. Note that trying
to compile a string into Bracket Notation can throw an
exception if the string is not syntactically valid (say, by
not balancing brackets right.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, calling
&amp;$coderef($lh, ...parameters...) can throw any sort of
exception (if, say, code in that sub tries to divide by
zero). But a very common exception occurs when you have
Bracket Notation text that says to call a method
&quot;foo&quot;, but there is no such method. (E.g.,
&quot;You have [qua<b>tn</b>,_1,ball].&quot; will throw an
exception on trying to call
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;qua<b>tn</b>($_[1],&rsquo;ball&rsquo;)
-- you presumably meant &quot;quant&quot;.)
<tt>&quot;maketext&quot;</tt> catches these exceptions, but
only to make the error message more readable, at which point
it rethrows the exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An exception
<i>may</i> be thrown if <i>key</i> is not found in any of
<tt>$lh</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>%Lexicon</tt> hashes. What happens
if a key is not found, is discussed in a later section,
&quot;Controlling Lookup Failure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
might find it useful in some cases to override the
<tt>&quot;maketext&quot;</tt> method with an &quot;after
method&quot;, if you want to translate encodings, or even
scripts:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package YrProj::zh_cn; # Chinese with PRC&minus;style glyphs
    use base ('YrProj::zh_tw');  # Taiwan&minus;style
    sub maketext {
      my $self = shift(@_);
      my $value = $self&minus;&gt;maketext(@_);
      return Chineeze::taiwan2mainland($value);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you may want
to override it with something that traps any exceptions, if
that&rsquo;s critical to your program:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub maketext {
    my($lh, @stuff) = @_;
    my $out;
    eval { $out = $lh&minus;&gt;SUPER::maketext(@stuff) };
    return $out unless $@;
    ...otherwise deal with the exception...
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other than
those two situations, I don&rsquo;t imagine that it&rsquo;s
useful to override the <tt>&quot;maketext&quot;</tt> method.
(If you run into a situation where it is useful, I&rsquo;d
be interested in hearing about it.) <br>
$lh&minus;&gt;fail_with <i>or</i> $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with(
<i><small>PARAM</small></i> ) <br>
$lh&minus;&gt;failure_handler_auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two methods are discussed
in the section &quot;Controlling Lookup Failure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Utility
Methods</b> <br>
These are methods that you may find it handy to use,
generally from <tt>%Lexicon</tt> routines of yours (whether
expressed as Bracket Notation or not). <br>
$language&minus;&gt;quant($number, $singular) <br>
$language&minus;&gt;quant($number, $singular, $plural) <br>
$language&minus;&gt;quant($number, $singular, $plural,
$negative)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is generally meant to be
called from inside Bracket Notation (which is discussed
later), as in</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     &quot;Your search matched [quant,_1,document]!&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s for
<i>quantifying</i> a noun (i.e., saying how much of it there
is, while giving the correct form of it). The behavior of
this method is handy for English and a few other Western
European languages, and you should override it for languages
where it&rsquo;s not suitable. You can feel free to read the
source, but the current implementation is basically as this
pseudocode describes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     if $number is 0 and there's a $negative,
        return $negative;
     elsif $number is 1,
        return &quot;1 $singular&quot;;
     elsif there's a $plural,
        return &quot;$number $plural&quot;;
     else
        return &quot;$number &quot; . $singular . &quot;s&quot;;
     #
     # ...except that we actually call numf to
     #  stringify $number before returning it.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So for English
(with Bracket Notation)
<tt>&quot;...[quant,_1,file]...&quot;</tt> is fine (for 0 it
returns &quot;0 files&quot;, for 1 it returns &quot;1
file&quot;, and for more it returns &quot;2 files&quot;,
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But for
&quot;directory&quot;, you&rsquo;d want
<tt>&quot;[quant,_1,directory,directories]&quot;</tt> so
that our elementary <tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt> method
doesn&rsquo;t think that the plural of &quot;directory&quot;
is &quot;directorys&quot;. And you might find that the
output may sound better if you specify a negative form, as
in:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     &quot;[quant,_1,file,files,No files] matched your query.\n&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to
keep in mind verb agreement (or adjectives too, in other
languages), as in:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     &quot;[quant,_1,document] were matched.\n&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because if _1
is one, you get &quot;1 document <b>were</b> matched&quot;.
An acceptable hack here is to do something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     &quot;[quant,_1,document was, documents were] matched.\n&quot;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%;">$language&minus;&gt;numf($number)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This returns the given number
formatted nicely according to this language&rsquo;s
conventions. Maketext&rsquo;s default method is mostly to
just take the normal string form of the number (applying
sprintf &quot;%G&quot; for only very large numbers), and
then to add commas as necessary. (Except that we apply
<tt>&quot;tr/,./.,/&quot;</tt> if
<tt>$language</tt>&minus;&gt;{&rsquo;numf_comma&rsquo;} is
true; that&rsquo;s a bit of a hack that&rsquo;s useful for
languages that express two million as &quot;2.000.000&quot;
and not as &quot;2,000,000&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
anything fancier, consider overriding this with something
that uses Number::Format, or does something else
entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that numf
is called by quant for stringifying all quantifying
numbers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$language&minus;&gt;numerate($number,
$singular, $plural, $negative)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This returns the given noun
form which is appropriate for the quantity <tt>$number</tt>
according to this language&rsquo;s conventions.
<tt>&quot;numerate&quot;</tt> is used internally by
<tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt> to quantify nouns. Use it
directly -- usually from bracket notation -- to avoid
<tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt>&rsquo;s implicit call to
<tt>&quot;numf&quot;</tt> and output of a numeric
quantity.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$language&minus;&gt;sprintf($format,
@items)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is just a wrapper around
Perl&rsquo;s normal <tt>&quot;sprintf&quot;</tt> function.
It&rsquo;s provided so that you can use &quot;sprintf&quot;
in Bracket Notation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$language&minus;&gt;<i>language_tag()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Currently this just takes the
last bit of <tt>&quot;ref($language)&quot;</tt>, turns
underscores to dashes, and returns it. So if
<tt>$language</tt> is an object of class
Hee::HOO::Haw::en_us,
<tt>$language</tt>&minus;&gt;<i>language_tag()</i> returns
&quot;en-us&quot;. (Yes, the usual representation for that
language tag is &quot;en-US&quot;, but case is <i>never</i>
considered meaningful in language-tag comparison.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may
override this as you like; Maketext doesn&rsquo;t use it for
anything.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$language&minus;&gt;<i>encoding()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Currently this isn&rsquo;t used
for anything, but it&rsquo;s provided (with default value of
<tt>&quot;(ref($language) &amp;&amp;
$language&minus;&gt;{'encoding'})) or
&quot;iso&minus;8859&minus;1&quot;&quot;</tt> ) as a sort of
suggestion that it may be useful/necessary to associate
encodings with your language handles (whether on a per-class
or even per-handle basis.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Language
Handle Attributes and Internals</b> <br>
A language handle is a flyweight object -- i.e., it
doesn&rsquo;t (necessarily) carry any data of interest,
other than just being a member of whatever class it belongs
to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A language
handle is implemented as a blessed hash. Subclasses of yours
can store whatever data you want in the hash. Currently the
only hash entry used by any crucial Maketext method is
&quot;fail&quot;, so feel free to use anything else as you
like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Remember:
Don&rsquo;t be afraid to read the Maketext source if
there&rsquo;s any point on which this documentation is
unclear.</b> This documentation is vastly longer than the
module source itself.</p>

(whether directly or indirectly) from Locale::Maketext. It
<b>doesn&rsquo;t matter</b> how you name this class,
although assuming this is the localization component of your
Super Mega Program, good names for your project class might
be SuperMegaProgram::Localization, SuperMegaProgram::L10N,

<h2>ENTRIES IN EACH LEXICON
<a name="ENTRIES IN EACH LEXICON"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
<tt>%Lexicon</tt> entry is meant to signify a phrase, taking
some number (0 or more) of parameters. An entry is meant to
be accessed by via a string <i>key</i> in
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,
...parameters...), which should return a string that is
generally meant for be used for &quot;output&quot; to the
user -- regardless of whether this actually means printing
to <small>STDOUT,</small> writing to a file, or putting into
a <small>GUI</small> widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the key
must be a string value (since that&rsquo;s a basic
restriction that Perl places on hash keys), the value in the
lexicon can currently be of several types: a defined scalar,
scalarref, or coderef. The use of these is explained above,
in the section &rsquo;The &quot;maketext&quot;
Method&rsquo;, and Bracket Notation for strings is discussed
in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While you can
use arbitrary unique IDs for lexicon keys (like
&quot;_min_larger_max_error&quot;), it is often useful for
if an entry&rsquo;s key is itself a valid value, like this
example error message:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compare this
code that uses an arbitrary <small>ID...</small></p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  die $lh&minus;&gt;maketext( &quot;_min_larger_max_error&quot;, $min, $max )
   if $min &gt; $max;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...to this code
that uses a key-as-value:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  die $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(
   &quot;Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,
   $min, $max
  ) if $min &gt; $max;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second is,
in short, more readable. In particular, it&rsquo;s obvious
that the number of parameters you&rsquo;re feeding to that
phrase (two) is the number of parameters that it
<i>wants</i> to be fed. (Since you see _1 and a _2 being
used in the key there.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, once a
project is otherwise complete and you start to localize it,
you can scrape together all the various keys you use, and
pass it to a translator; and then the translator&rsquo;s
work will go faster if what he&rsquo;s presented is
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,
  =&gt; &quot;&quot;,   # fill in something here, Jacques!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rather than
this more cryptic mess:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;_min_larger_max_error&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;&quot;,   # fill in something here, Jacques</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I think that
keys as lexicon values makes the completed lexicon entries
more readable:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,
  =&gt; &quot;Le minimum ([_1]) est plus grand que le maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, having
valid values as keys becomes very useful if you set up an
_AUTO lexicon. _AUTO lexicons are discussed in a later
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I almost always
use keys that are themselves valid lexicon values. One
notable exception is when the value is quite long. For
example, to get the screenful of data that a command-line
program might return when given an unknown switch, I often
just use a brief, self-explanatory key such as
&quot;_USAGE_MESSAGE&quot;. At that point I then go and
immediately to define that lexicon entry in the
ProjectClass::L10N::en lexicon (since English is always my
&quot;project language&quot;):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  '_USAGE_MESSAGE' =&gt; &lt;&lt;'EOSTUFF',
  ...long long message...
  EOSTUFF</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then I can
use it as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  getopt('oDI', \%opts) or die $lh&minus;&gt;maketext('_USAGE_MESSAGE');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Incidentally,
note that each class&rsquo;s <tt>%Lexicon</tt>
inherits-and-extends the lexicons in its superclasses. This
is not because these are special hashes <i>per se</i>, but
because you access them via the
<tt>&quot;maketext&quot;</tt> method, which looks for
entries across all the <tt>%Lexicon</tt> hashes in a
language class <i>and</i> all its ancestor classes. (This is
because the idea of &quot;class data&quot; isn&rsquo;t
directly implemented in Perl, but is instead left to
individual class-systems to implement as they see fit..)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
may have things stored in a lexicon besides just phrases for
output: for example, if your program takes input from the
keyboard, asking a &quot;(Y/N)&quot; question, you probably
need to know what the equivalent of &quot;Y[es]/N[o]&quot;
is in whatever language. You probably also need to know what
the equivalents of the answers &quot;y&quot; and
&quot;n&quot; are. You can store that information in the
lexicon (say, under the keys &quot;~answer_y&quot; and
&quot;~answer_n&quot;, and the long forms as
&quot;~answer_yes&quot; and &quot;~answer_no&quot;, where
&quot;~&quot; is just an ad-hoc character meant to indicate
to programmers/translators that these are not phrases for
output).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or instead of
storing this in the language class&rsquo;s lexicon, you can
(and, in some cases, really should) represent the same bit
of knowledge as code in a method in the language class.
(That leaves a tidy distinction between the lexicon as the
things we know how to <i>say</i>, and the rest of the things
in the lexicon class as things that we know how to
<i>do</i>.) Consider this example of a processor for
responses to French &quot;oui/non&quot; questions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub y_or_n {
    return undef unless defined $_[1] and length $_[1];
    my $answer = lc $_[1];  # smash case
    return 1 if $answer eq 'o' or $answer eq 'oui';
    return 0 if $answer eq 'n' or $answer eq 'non';
    return undef;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...which
you&rsquo;d then call in a construct like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $response;
  until(defined $response) {
    print $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(&quot;Open the pod bay door (y/n)? &quot;);
    $response = $lh&minus;&gt;y_or_n( get_input_from_keyboard_somehow() );
  }
  if($response) { $pod_bay_door&minus;&gt;open()         }
  else          { $pod_bay_door&minus;&gt;leave_closed() }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other data
worth storing in a lexicon might be things like filenames
for language-targetted resources:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  ...
  &quot;_main_splash_png&quot;
    =&gt; &quot;/styles/en_us/main_splash.png&quot;,
  &quot;_main_splash_imagemap&quot;
    =&gt; &quot;/styles/en_us/main_splash.incl&quot;,
  &quot;_general_graphics_path&quot;
    =&gt; &quot;/styles/en_us/&quot;,
  &quot;_alert_sound&quot;
    =&gt; &quot;/styles/en_us/hey_there.wav&quot;,
  &quot;_forward_icon&quot;
   =&gt; &quot;left_arrow.png&quot;,
  &quot;_backward_icon&quot;
   =&gt; &quot;right_arrow.png&quot;,
  # In some other languages, left equals
  #  BACKwards, and right is FOREwards.
  ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might want
to do the same thing for expressing key bindings or the like
(since hardwiring &quot;q&quot; as the binding for the
function that quits a screen/menu/program is useful only if
your language happens to associate &quot;q&quot; with
&quot;quit&quot;!)</p>

<h2>BRACKET NOTATION
<a name="BRACKET NOTATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket
Notation is a crucial feature of Locale::Maketext. I mean
Bracket Notation to provide a replacement for the use of
sprintf formatting. Everything you do with Bracket Notation
could be done with a sub block, but bracket notation is
meant to be much more concise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket
Notation is a like a miniature &quot;template&quot; system
(in the sense of Text::Template, not in the sense of C
<small>++</small> templates), where normal text is passed
thru basically as is, but text in special regions is
specially interpreted. In Bracket Notation, you use square
brackets (&quot;[...]&quot;), not curly braces
(&quot;{...}&quot;) to note sections that are specially
interpreted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
here all the areas that are taken literally are underlined
with a &quot;^&quot;, and all the in-bracket special regions
are underlined with an X:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n&quot;,
   ^^^^^^^^^ XX ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ XX ^^^^</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When that
string is compiled from bracket notation into a real Perl
sub, it&rsquo;s basically turned into:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub {
    my $lh = $_[0];
    my @params = @_;
    return join '',
      &quot;Minimum (&quot;,
      ...some code here...
      &quot;) is larger than maximum (&quot;,
      ...some code here...
      &quot;)!\n&quot;,
  }
  # to be called by $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(KEY, params...)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
text outside bracket groups is turned into string literals.
Text in brackets is rather more complex, and currently
follows these rules:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bracket groups that are empty,
or which consist only of whitespace, are ignored. (Examples:
&quot;[]&quot;, &quot;[ ]&quot;, or a [ and a ] with returns
and/or tabs and/or spaces between them.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, each

<tt>$_</tt>[&minus;3] (in which case <tt>@_</tt> should have
at least three elements in it). Note that <tt>$_</tt>[0] is
the language handle, and is typically not named

&quot;_&minus;<i>number</i>&quot;, &quot;_*&quot;, nor a
valid method name; and so Locale::Maketext will throw an
exception of you try compiling an expression containing this
bracket group.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note,
incidentally, that items in each group are comma-separated,
not <tt>&quot;/\s*,\s*/&quot;</tt>&minus;separated. That is,
you might expect that this bracket group:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Hoohah [foo, _1 , bar ,baz]!&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would compile
to this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub {
    my $lh = $_[0];
    return join '',
      &quot;Hoohah &quot;,
      $lh&minus;&gt;foo( $_[1], &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;),
      &quot;!&quot;,
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But it actually
compiles as this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub {
    my $lh = $_[0];
    return join '',
      &quot;Hoohah &quot;,
      $lh&minus;&gt;foo(&quot; _1 &quot;, &quot; bar &quot;, &quot;baz&quot;),  # note the &lt;space&gt; in &quot; bar &quot;
      &quot;!&quot;,
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the notation
discussed so far, the characters &quot;[&quot; and
&quot;]&quot; are given special meaning, for opening and
closing bracket groups, and &quot;,&quot; has a special
meaning inside bracket groups, where it separates items in
the group. This begs the question of how you&rsquo;d express
a literal &quot;[&quot; or &quot;]&quot; in a Bracket
Notation string, and how you&rsquo;d express a literal comma
inside a bracket group. For this purpose I&rsquo;ve adopted
&quot;~&quot; (tilde) as an escape character: &quot;~[&quot;
means a literal &rsquo;[&rsquo; character anywhere in
Bracket Notation (i.e., regardless of whether you&rsquo;re
in a bracket group or not), and ditto for &quot;~]&quot;
meaning a literal &rsquo;]&rsquo;, and &quot;~,&quot;
meaning a literal comma. (Altho &quot;,&quot; means a
literal comma outside of bracket groups -- it&rsquo;s only
inside bracket groups that commas are special.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And on the off
chance you need a literal tilde in a bracket expression, you
get it with &quot;~~&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, an
unescaped &quot;~&quot; before a character other than a
bracket or a comma is taken to mean just a &quot;~&quot; and
that character. I.e., &quot;~X&quot; means the same as
&quot;~~X&quot; -- i.e., one literal tilde, and then one
literal &quot;X&quot;. However, by using &quot;~X&quot;, you
are assuming that no future version of Maketext will use
&quot;~X&quot; as a magic escape sequence. In practice this
is not a great problem, since first off you can just write
&quot;~~X&quot; and not worry about it; second off, I doubt
I&rsquo;ll add lots of new magic characters to bracket
notation; and third off, you aren&rsquo;t likely to want
literal &quot;~&quot; characters in your messages anyway,
since it&rsquo;s not a character with wide use in natural
language text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Brackets must
be balanced -- every openbracket must have one matching
closebracket, and vice versa. So these are all
<b>invalid</b>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;I ate [quant,_1,rhubarb pie.&quot;
  &quot;I ate [quant,_1,rhubarb pie[.&quot;
  &quot;I ate quant,_1,rhubarb pie].&quot;
  &quot;I ate quant,_1,rhubarb pie[.&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
bracket groups do not nest. That is, you <b>cannot</b>
say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Foo [bar,baz,[quux,quuux]]\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need a
notation that&rsquo;s that powerful, use normal Perl:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  %Lexicon = (

    },
    ...
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or write the
&quot;bar&quot; method so you don&rsquo;t need to pass it
the output from calling quux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I do not

<h2>AUTO LEXICONS
<a name="AUTO LEXICONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If maketext
goes to look in an individual <tt>%Lexicon</tt> for an entry
for <i>key</i> (where <i>key</i> does not start with an
underscore), and sees none, <b>but does see</b> an entry of
&quot;_AUTO&quot; =&gt; <i>some_true_value</i>, then we
actually define <tt>$Lexicon</tt>{<i>key</i>} = <i>key</i>
right then and there, and then use that value as if it had
been there all along. This happens before we even look in
any superclass <tt>%Lexicons</tt>!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(This is meant
to be somewhat like the <small>AUTOLOAD</small> mechanism in
Perl&rsquo;s function call system -- or, looked at another
way, like the AutoLoader module.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I can picture
all sorts of circumstances where you just do not want lookup
to be able to fail (since failing normally means that
maketext throws a <tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt>, although see the
next section for greater control over that). But
here&rsquo;s one circumstance where _AUTO lexicons are meant
to be <i>especially</i> useful:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you&rsquo;re
writing an application, you decide as you go what messages
you need to emit. Normally you&rsquo;d go to write this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  if(&minus;e $filename) {
    go_process_file($filename)
  } else {
    print qq{Couldn't find file &quot;$filename&quot;!\n};
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but since you
anticipate localizing this, you write:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use ThisProject::I18N;
  my $lh = ThisProject::I18N&minus;&gt;get_handle();
   # For the moment, assume that things are set up so
   # that we load class ThisProject::I18N::en
   # and that that's the class that $lh belongs to.
  ...
  if(&minus;e $filename) {
    go_process_file($filename)
  } else {
    print $lh&minus;&gt;maketext(
      qq{Couldn't find file &quot;[_1]&quot;!\n}, $filename
    );
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, right
after you&rsquo;ve just written the above lines, you&rsquo;d
normally have to go open the file ThisProject/I18N/en.pm,
and immediately add an entry:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Couldn't find file \&quot;[_1]\&quot;!\n&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;Couldn't find file \&quot;[_1]\&quot;!\n&quot;,</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But I consider
that somewhat of a distraction from the work of getting the
main code working -- to say nothing of the fact that I often
have to play with the program a few times before I can
decide exactly what wording I want in the messages (which in
this case would require me to go changing three lines of
code: the call to maketext with that key, and then the two
lines in ThisProject/I18N/en.pm).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
set &quot;_AUTO =&gt; 1&quot; in the <tt>%Lexicon</tt> in,
ThisProject/I18N/en.pm (assuming that English (en) is the
language that all your programmers will be using for this
project&rsquo;s internal message keys), then you don&rsquo;t
ever have to go adding lines like this</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &quot;Couldn't find file \&quot;[_1]\&quot;!\n&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;Couldn't find file \&quot;[_1]\&quot;!\n&quot;,</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to
ThisProject/I18N/en.pm, because if _AUTO is true there, then
just looking for an entry with the key &quot;Couldn&rsquo;t
find file \&quot;[_1]\&quot;!\n&quot; in that lexicon will
cause it to be added, with that value!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
reason that keys that start with &quot;_&quot; are immune to
_AUTO isn&rsquo;t anything generally magical about the
underscore character -- I just wanted a way to have most
lexicon keys be autoable, except for possibly a few, and I
arbitrarily decided to use a leading underscore as a signal
to distinguish those few.</p>

<h2>READONLY LEXICONS
<a name="READONLY LEXICONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your lexicon
is a tied hash the simple act of caching the compiled value
can be fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example a
GDBM_File <small>GDBM_READER</small> tied hash will die with
something like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   gdbm store returned &minus;1, errno 2, key &quot;...&quot; at ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All you need to
do is turn on caching outside of the lexicon hash itself
like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   sub init {
       my ($lh) = @_;
       ...
       $lh&minus;&gt;{'use_external_lex_cache'} = 1;
       ...
   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then
instead of storing the compiled value in the lexicon hash it
will store it in
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;{&rsquo;_external_lex_cache&rsquo;}</p>

<h2>CONTROLLING LOOKUP FAILURE
<a name="CONTROLLING LOOKUP FAILURE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you call
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,
...parameters...), and there&rsquo;s no entry <i>key</i> in
<tt>$lh</tt>&rsquo;s class&rsquo;s <tt>%Lexicon</tt>, nor in
the superclass <tt>%Lexicon</tt> hash, <i>and</i> if we
can&rsquo;t auto-make <i>key</i> (because either it starts
with a &quot;_&quot;, or because none of its lexicons have
<tt>&quot;_AUTO =&gt; 1,&quot;</tt>), then we have failed to
find a normal way to maketext <i>key</i>. What then happens
in these failure conditions, depends on the <tt>$lh</tt>
object&rsquo;s &quot;fail&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the language
handle has no &quot;fail&quot; attribute, maketext will
simply throw an exception (i.e., it calls
<tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt>, mentioning the <i>key</i> whose
lookup failed, and naming the line number where the calling
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...) was.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the language
handle has a &quot;fail&quot; attribute whose value is a
coderef, then
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...params...)
gives up and calls:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  return $that_subref&minus;&gt;($lh, $key, @params);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
&quot;fail&quot; attribute&rsquo;s value should be a string
denoting a method name, so that
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...params...) can
give up with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  return $lh&minus;&gt;$that_method_name($phrase, @params);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;fail&quot; attribute can be accessed with the
<tt>&quot;fail_with&quot;</tt> method:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  # Set to a coderef:
  $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with( \&amp;failure_handler );
  # Set to a method name:
  $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with( 'failure_method' );
  # Set to nothing (i.e., so failure throws a plain exception)
  $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with( undef );
  # Get the current value
  $handler = $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, as to what
you may want to do with these handlers: Maybe you&rsquo;d
want to log what key failed for what class, and then die.
Maybe you don&rsquo;t like <tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt> and
instead you want to send the error message to
<small>STDOUT</small> (or wherever) and then merely
<tt>&quot;exit()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or maybe you
don&rsquo;t want to <tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt> at all! Maybe
you could use a handler like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  # Make all lookups fall back onto an English value,
  #  but only after we log it for later fingerpointing.
  my $lh_backup = ThisProject&minus;&gt;get_handle('en');
  open(LEX_FAIL_LOG, &quot;&gt;&gt;wherever/lex.log&quot;) || die &quot;GNAARGH $!&quot;;
  sub lex_fail {
    my($failing_lh, $key, $params) = @_;
    print LEX_FAIL_LOG scalar(localtime), &quot;\t&quot;,
       ref($failing_lh), &quot;\t&quot;, $key, &quot;\n&quot;;
    return $lh_backup&minus;&gt;maketext($key,@params);
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some users have
expressed that they think this whole mechanism of having a
&quot;fail&quot; attribute at all, seems a rather pointless
complication. But I want Locale::Maketext to be usable for
software projects of <i>any</i> scale and type; and
different software projects have different ideas of what the
right thing is to do in failure conditions. I could simply
say that failure always throws an exception, and that if you
want to be careful, you&rsquo;ll just have to wrap every
call to <tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext in an
eval&nbsp;{&nbsp;}. However, I want programmers to reserve
the right (via the &quot;fail&quot; attribute) to treat
lookup failure as something other than an exception of the
same level of severity as a config file being unreadable, or
some essential resource being inaccessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One possibly
useful value for the &quot;fail&quot; attribute is the
method name &quot;failure_handler_auto&quot;. This is a
method defined in the class Locale::Maketext itself. You set
it with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with('failure_handler_auto');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then when you
call <tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,
...parameters...) and there&rsquo;s no <i>key</i> in any of
those lexicons, maketext gives up with</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  return $lh&minus;&gt;failure_handler_auto($key, @params);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But
failure_handler_auto, instead of dying or anything, compiles
<tt>$key</tt>, caching it in</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $lh&minus;&gt;{'failure_lex'}{$key} = $complied</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then calls
the compiled value, and returns that. (I.e., if
<tt>$key</tt> looks like bracket notation,
<tt>$compiled</tt> is a sub, and we return
&amp;{$compiled}(@params); but if <tt>$key</tt> is just a
plain string, we just return that.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
using &quot;failure_auto_handler&quot; is like an
<small>AUTO</small> lexicon, except that it 1) compiles
<tt>$key</tt> even if it starts with &quot;_&quot;, and 2)
you have a record in the new hashref
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;{&rsquo;failure_lex&rsquo;} of all
the keys that have failed for this object. This should avoid
your program dying -- as long as your keys aren&rsquo;t
actually invalid as bracket code, and as long as they
don&rsquo;t try calling methods that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;failure_auto_handler&quot;
may not be exactly what you want, but I hope it at least
shows you that maketext failure can be mitigated in any
number of very flexible ways. If you can formalize exactly
what you want, you should be able to express that as a
failure handler. You can even make it default for every
object of a given class, by setting it in that class&rsquo;s
init:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub init {
    my $lh = $_[0];  # a newborn handle
    $lh&minus;&gt;SUPER::init();
    $lh&minus;&gt;fail_with('my_clever_failure_handler');
    return;
  }
  sub my_clever_failure_handler {
    ...you clever things here...

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you get
tired of constantly saying <tt>&quot;print

functional wrapper for it, like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  use Projname::L10N;

   # so if maketext fails, we see made the call to pmt</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Besides whole

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the program is otherwise
done, and once its localization for the first language works
right (via the data and methods in Projname::L10N::en_us),
you can get together the data for translation. If your first
language lexicon isn&rsquo;t an _AUTO lexicon, then you
already have all the messages explicitly in the lexicon (or
else you&rsquo;d be getting exceptions thrown when you call
<tt>$lh</tt>&minus;&gt;maketext to get messages that
aren&rsquo;t in there). But if you were (advisedly) lazy and
are using an _AUTO lexicon, then you&rsquo;ve got to make a
list of all the phrases that you&rsquo;ve so far been
letting _AUTO generate for you. There are very many ways to
assemble such a list. The most straightforward is to simply
grep the source for every occurrence of &quot;maketext&quot;
(or calls to wrappers around it, like the above
<tt>&quot;pmt&quot;</tt> function), and to log the following
phrase.</p> </td></tr>

_AUTO lexicon. It may be true that in theory, all needed
messages will be in each language class; but in the
presumably unlikely or &quot;impossible&quot; case of lookup
failure, you should consider whether your program should
throw an exception, emit text in English (or whatever your
project&rsquo;s first language is), or some more complex
solution as described in the section &quot;Controlling

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(You may, in
fact, want to start with localizing to <i>one</i> other
language at first, if you&rsquo;re not sure that
you&rsquo;ve properly abstracted the language-dependent
parts of your code.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Translators may
request clarification of the situation in which a particular
phrase is found. For example, in English we are entirely
happy saying &quot;<i>n</i> files found&quot;, regardless of
whether we mean &quot;I looked for files, and found <i>n</i>
of them&quot; or the rather distinct situation of &quot;I
looked for something else (like lines in files), and along
the way I saw <i>n</i> files.&quot; This may involve
rethinking things that you thought quite clear: should
&quot;Edit&quot; on a toolbar be a noun
(&quot;editing&quot;) or a verb (&quot;to edit&quot;)? Is
there already a conventionalized way to express that menu
option, separate from the target language&rsquo;s normal
word for &quot;to edit&quot;?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In all cases
where the very common phenomenon of quantification (saying
&quot;<i>N</i> files&quot;, for <b>any</b> value of N) is
involved, each translator should make clear what
dependencies the number causes in the sentence. In many
cases, dependency is limited to words adjacent to the
number, in places where you might expect them (&quot;I found
the&minus;?PLURAL <i>N</i> empty&minus;?PLURAL
directory&minus;?PLURAL&quot;), but in some cases there are
unexpected dependencies (&quot;I found&minus;?PLURAL
...&quot;!) as well as long-distance dependencies &quot;The
<i>N</i> directory&minus;?PLURAL could not be
deleted&minus;?PLURAL&quot;!).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Remind the
translators to consider the case where N is 0: &quot;0 files
found&quot; isn&rsquo;t exactly natural-sounding in any
language, but it may be unacceptable in many -- or it may
condition special kinds of agreement (similar to English
&quot;I didN&rsquo;T find <small>ANY</small>
files&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to ask
your translators about numeral formatting in their language,
so that you can override the <tt>&quot;numf&quot;</tt>
method as appropriate. Typical variables in number
formatting are: what to use as a decimal point (comma?
period?); what to use as a thousands separator (space?
nonbreaking space? comma? period? small middot? prime?
apostrophe?); and even whether the so-called &quot;thousands
separator&quot; is actually for every third digit --
I&rsquo;ve heard reports of two hundred thousand being
expressible as &quot;2,00,000&quot; for some Indian
(Subcontinental) languages, besides the less surprising
&quot;200&nbsp;000&quot;, &quot;200.000&quot;,
&quot;200,000&quot;, and &quot;200&rsquo;000&quot;. Also,
using a set of numeral glyphs other than the usual
<small>ASCII &quot;0&quot;&minus;&quot;9&quot;</small> might
be appreciated, as via
<tt>&quot;tr/0&minus;9/\x{0966}&minus;\x{096F}/&quot;</tt>
for getting digits in Devanagari script (for Hindi, Konkani,
others).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
<tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt> method that Locale::Maketext
provides should be good for many languages. For some
languages, it might be useful to modify it (or its
constituent <tt>&quot;numerate&quot;</tt> method) to take a
plural form in the two-argument call to
<tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt> (as in
&quot;[quant,_1,files]&quot;) if it&rsquo;s all-around
easier to infer the singular form from the plural, than to
infer the plural form from the singular.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But for other
languages (as is discussed at length in
Locale::Maketext::TPJ13), simple
<tt>&quot;quant&quot;</tt>/<tt>&quot;numf&quot;</tt> is not
enough. For the particularly problematic Slavic languages,
what you may need is a method which you provide with the
number, the citation form of the noun to quantify, and the
case and gender that the sentence&rsquo;s syntax projects
onto that noun slot. The method would then be responsible
for determining what grammatical number that numeral
projects onto its noun phrase, and what case and gender it
may override the normal case and gender with; and then it
would look up the noun in a lexicon providing all needed
inflected forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also wish to discuss
with the translators the question of how to relate different
subforms of the same language tag, considering how this
reacts with <tt>&quot;get_handle&quot;</tt>&rsquo;s
treatment of these. For example, if a user accepts
interfaces in &quot;en, fr&quot;, and you have interfaces
available in &quot;en-US&quot; and &quot;fr&quot;, what
should they get? You may wish to resolve this by
establishing that &quot;en&quot; and &quot;en-US&quot; are
effectively synonymous, by having one class zero-derive from
the other.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For some
languages this issue may never come up (Danish is rarely
expressed as &quot;da-DK&quot;, but instead is just
&quot;da&quot;). And for other languages, the whole concept
of a &quot;generic&quot; form may verge on being uselessly
vague, particularly for interfaces involving voice media in
forms of Arabic or Chinese.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you&rsquo;ve localized your
program/site/etc. for all desired languages, be sure to show
the result (whether live, or via screenshots) to the
translators. Once they approve, make every effort to have it
then checked by at least one other speaker of that language.
This holds true even when (or especially when) the
translation is done by one of your own programmers. Some
kinds of systems may be harder to find testers for than
others, depending on the amount of domain-specific jargon
and concepts involved -- it&rsquo;s easier to find people
who can tell you whether they approve of your translation
for &quot;delete this message&quot; in an email-via-Web
interface, than to find people who can give you an informed
opinion on your translation for &quot;attribute value&quot;
in an <small>XML</small> query tool&rsquo;s interface.</p></td></tr>

reading all of these:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext::TPJ13
-- my <i>The Perl Journal</i> article about Maketext. It
explains many important concepts underlying
Locale::Maketext&rsquo;s design, and some insight into why
Maketext is better than the plain old approach of having
message catalogs that are just databases of sprintf
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File::Findgrep
is a sample application/module that uses Locale::Maketext to
localize its messages. For a larger internationalized
system, see also Apache::MP3.</p>

recent gettext tarball and look in its &quot;doc/&quot;
directory, there&rsquo;s an easily browsable
<small>HTML</small> version in there. The gettext
documentation asks lots of questions worth thinking about,
even if some of their answers are sometimes wonky,
particularly where they start talking about
pluralization.</p>
