<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Release 6.5 and

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Open
Group&rsquo;s X Project Team was created as the successor to
the X Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium ceased
operations and transferred ownership of X11 to The Open
Group. The X.Org Group (hereinafter called
&quot;X.Org&quot;) was created as the successor to The X
Project Team after the The Open Group ceased operating The X
Project Team. The purpose of X.Org was to foster
development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Window
System. X.Org operates under the corporate umbrella of The
Open Group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The X
Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware
membership corporation. It was formed in 1993 as the
successor to the MIT X Consortium.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The X Window
System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded
consortium to provide the technical and administrative
leadership necessary to support further development of the X
Window System. In 1992, MIT and the membership decided it
was in their best interests to move the consortium out of
MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization. All
rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X
Consortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994. On December 31, 1996
the X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors and all rights to
the X Window System were assigned to The Open Group.</p>
