<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all SCSI
direct access devices need to be formatted and some have
vendor specific formatting procedures. SCSI disks with
rotating media are probably the largest group that do
support a &rsquo;standard&rsquo; format operation. They are
typically factory formatted to a block size of 512 bytes
with the largest number of blocks that the manufacturer
recommends. The manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendation
typically leaves aside a certain number of tracks, spread
across the media, for reassignment of blocks to logical
block addresses during the life of the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
can format modern SCSI disks and potentially change their
block size (if permitted) and the block count (i.e. number
of accessible blocks on the media also known as
&quot;resizing&quot;). Resizing a disk to less than the
manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended block count is sometimes
called &quot;short stroking&quot; (see NOTES section).
Resizing the block count while not changing the block size
may not require a format operation. The SBC&minus;2 standard
(see www.t10.org) has obsoleted the &quot;format
device&quot; mode page. Many of the low level details found
in that mode page are now left up to the discretion of the
manufacturer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this
utility is used without options (i.e. it is only given a
DEVICE argument) it prints out the existing block size and
block count derived from two sources. These two sources are
a block descriptor in the response to a MODE SENSE command
and the response to a READ CAPACITY command. The reason for
this double check is to detect a &quot;format corrupt&quot;
state (see NOTES section). This usage will not modify the
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this
utility is used with the &quot;&minus;&minus;format&quot;
(or &quot;&minus;F&quot;) option it will attempt to format
the given DEVICE. There is a 10 second pause during which
time the user is invited twice (5 seconds apart) to abort
sg_format. This occurs just prior the SCSI FORMAT UNIT
command being issued. See the NOTES section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Protection
information is optional and is made up of 8 additional bytes
associated with each logical block. Four protection types
are defined with protection type 0 being no additional
protection bytes. See the PROTECTION TYPES section below for
more information.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. The
options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name. <b><br>
&minus;C</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;cmplst</b>={0|1}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the CMPLST (&quot;complete
list&quot;) bit in the FORMAT UNIT cdb to 0 or 1. The
default is 1 in which case the existing GLIST (grown list)
is ignored. If the value is 0 then the existing GLIST is
taken into account. See the LISTS section below. In most
cases this bit should be left set; some MO disk drives need
this bit cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;count</b>=<i>COUNT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>COUNT</i> is the
number of blocks to be formatted or media to be resized to.
Can be used with either <i>&minus;&minus;format</i> or
<i>&minus;&minus;resize</i>. With
<i>&minus;&minus;format</i> this option need not be given in
which case it is assumed to be zero. With
<i>&minus;&minus;format</i> the interpretation of
<i>COUNT</i> is: <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> &gt; 0) : only format the first <i>COUNT</i>
blocks and READ <br>
CAPACITY will report <i>COUNT</i> blocks after format <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> = 0) and block size unchanged : use existing
block count <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> = 0) and block size changed : recommended
maximum block <br>
count for new block size <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> = &minus;1) : use recommended maximum block
count <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> &lt; &minus;1) : illegal <br>
With <i>&minus;&minus;resize</i> this option must be given
and <i>COUNT</i> has this interpretation: <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> &gt; 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will
report <i>COUNT</i> <br>
blocks <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> = 0) : after resize READ CAPACITY will report
0 blocks <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> = &minus;1) : after resize READ CAPACITY will
report its <br>
maximum number of blocks <br>
(<i>COUNT</i> &lt; &minus;1) : illegal <br>
In both cases if the given <i>COUNT</i> exceeds the maximum
number of blocks (for the block size) then the disk reports
an error. See NOTES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;dcrt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option sets the DCRT bit
in the FORMAT UNIT command&rsquo;s parameter list header. It
will &quot;disable certification&quot;. Certification
verifies that blocks are usable during the format process.
Using this option may speed the format. The default action
of this utility (i.e. when this option is not given) is to
clear the DCRT bit thereby requesting &quot;media
certification&quot;. When the DCRT bit is set, the FOV bit
must also be set hence sg_format does that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;e</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;early</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">during a format operation, The
default action of this utility is to poll the disk every 60
seconds to determine the progress of the format operation
until it is finished. When this option is given this utility
will exit &quot;early&quot;, that is as soon as the format
operation has commenced. Then the user can monitor the
progress of the ongoing format operation with other
utilities (e.g. sg_turs(8) or sg_requests(8)). This option
and <i>&minus;&minus;wait</i> are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo</b>=<i>FPI</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the FMTPINFO field in the
FORMAT UNIT cdb to a value between 0 and 3. The default
value is 0. The FMTPINFO field from SBC&minus;3 revision 16
is a 2 bit field (bits 7 and 6 of byte 1 in the cdb). Prior
to that it was a single bit field (bit 7 of byte 1 in the
cdb) and there was an accompanying bit called RTO_REQ (bit 6
of byte 1 in the cdb). The deprecated options
&quot;&minus;&minus;pinfo&quot; and
&quot;&minus;&minus;rto&minus;req&quot; represent the older
usage. This option should be used in their place. See the
PROTECTION TYPES section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;F</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;format</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">issue a SCSI FORMAT UNIT
command. <b>This will destroy all the data held on the
media.</b> This option is required to change the block size
of a disk. The user is given a 10 second count down to
ponder the wisdom of doing this, during which time
control&minus;C (amongst other Unix commands) can be used to
kill this process before it does any damage. See NOTES
section for implementation details and EXAMPLES section for
typical use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print out the usage information
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;long</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">the default action of this
utility is to assume 32 bit logical block addresses. With
512 byte block size this permits more than 2 terabytes
(almost 2 ** 41 bytes) on a single disk. This option selects
commands and parameters that allow for 64 bit logical block
addresses. Specifically this option sets the
&quot;longlba&quot; flag in the MODE SENSE (10) command and
uses READ CAPACITY (16) rather than READ CAPACITY (10). If
this option is not given and READ CAPACITY (10) or MODE
SELECT detects a disk the needs more than 32 bits to
represent its logical blocks then it is set internally. This
option does not set the LONGLIST bit in the FORMAT UNIT
command. The LONGLIST bit is set as required depending other
parameters (e.g. when &rsquo;&minus;&minus;pie=PIE&rsquo; is
greater than zero).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;P</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;pfu</b>=<i>PFU</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the &quot;Protection Field
Usage&quot; field in the parameter block associated with a
FORMAT UNIT command to <i>PFU</i>. The default value is 0,
the only other defined value currently is 1. See the
PROTECTION TYPES section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;q</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;pie</b>=<i>PIE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the &quot;Protection
Interval Exponent&quot; field in the parameter block
associated with a FORMAT UNIT command to <i>PIE</i>. The
default value is 0. This field first appeared in SBC&minus;3
revision 18.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;pinfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option is deprecated, use
the <i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i> option instead. If
used, then it sets bit 7 of byte 1 in the FORMAT UNIT cdb
and that is equivalent to setting
<i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=2</i>. [So if
<i>&minus;&minus;pinfo</i> is used (plus
<i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i> and
<i>&minus;&minus;pfu=PFU</i> are not given or their
arguments are 0) then protection type 1 is selected.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;poll</b>=<i>PT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>PT</i> is the type of
poll used. If <i>PT</i> is 0 then a TEST UNIT READY command
is used, otherwise a REQUEST SENSE command is used. The
default is currently 0 but this will change to 1 in the near
future. See the NOTES sections below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;r</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;resize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">rather than format the disk, it
can be resized. This means changing the number of blocks on
the device reported by the READ CAPACITY command. This
option should be used with the
<i>&minus;&minus;count=COUNT</i> option. The contents of all
logical blocks on the media remain unchanged when this
option is used. This means that any resize operation can be
reversed. This option cannot be used together with either
<i>&minus;&minus;format</i> or a
<i>&minus;&minus;size=SIZE</i> whose argument is different
to the existing block size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;R</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;rto_req</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The option is deprecated, use
the <i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i> option instead. If
used, then it sets bit 6 of byte 1 in the FORMAT UNIT
cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;S</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;security</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the &quot;Security
Initialization&quot; (SI) bit in the FORMAT UNIT
command&rsquo;s initialization pattern descriptor within the
parameter list. According to SBC&minus;3 the default
initialization pattern &quot;shall be written using a
security erasure write technique&quot;. See the NOTES
section on the SCSI SANITIZE command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;6</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;six</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use 6 byte variants of MODE
SENSE and MODE SELECT. The default action is to use the 10
byte variants. Some MO drives need this option set when
doing a format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;size</b>=<i>SIZE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>SIZE</i> is the block
size (i.e. number of bytes in each block) to format the
device to. The default value is whatever is currently
reported by the block descriptor in a MODE SENSE command. If
the block size given by this option is different from the
current value then a MODE SELECT command is used to change
it prior to the FORMAT UNIT command being started (as
recommended in the draft standard). Many SCSI disks have 512
byte sectors by default and allow up to 16 bytes extra in a
sector (i.e. 528 byte sectors). If the given size in
unacceptable with the disk, most likely an &quot;Invalid
field in parameter list&quot; message will appear in sense
data (requires the use of &rsquo;&minus;v&rsquo; to decode
sense data).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the level of
verbosity, (i.e. debug output). &quot;&minus;vvv&quot; gives
a lot more debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;V</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print the version string and
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;wait</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">the default format action is to
set the &quot;IMMED&quot; bit in the FORMAT UNIT
command&rsquo;s (short) parameter header. If this option
(i.e. <i>&minus;&minus;wait</i>) is given then the
&quot;IMMED&quot; bit is not set. If
<i>&minus;&minus;wait</i> is given the FORMAT UNIT command
waits until the format operation completes before returning
its response. This can be many hours on large disks. This
utility sets a 15 hour timeout on such a FORMAT UNIT
command!</p>

<h2>LISTS
<a name="LISTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SBC&minus;3
draft (revision 29) defines PLIST, CLIST, DLIST and GLIST in
section 4.13 on &quot;Medium defects&quot;. Briefly, the
PLIST is the &quot;primary&quot; list of manufacturer
detected defects, the CLIST (&quot;certification&quot; list)
contains those detected during the format operation, the
DLIST is a list of defects that can be given to the format
operation. The GLIST is the grown list which starts in the
format process as CLIST+DLIST and can &quot;grow&quot; later
due to automatic reallocation (see the ARRE and AWRE bits in
the read&minus;write error recovery mode page (see
sdparm(8))) and use of the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command (see
sg_reassign(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The CMPLST bit
(controlled by the <i>&minus;&minus;cmplst=</i>0|1 option)
determines whether the existing GLIST, when the format
operation is invoked, is taken into account. The sg_format
utility sets the FOV bit to zero which causes DPRY=0, so the
PLIST is taken into account, and DCRT=0, so the CLIST is
generated and used during the format process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sg_format
utility does not permit a user to provide a defect list
(i.e. DLIST).</p>

<h2>PROTECTION TYPES
<a name="PROTECTION TYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SBC&minus;3
drafts have added several &quot;protection types&quot; to
the &quot;protection information&quot; introduced in the
SBC&minus;2 standard. See the &quot;protection
information&quot; section (section 4.21 in draft SBC&minus;3
rev 29). 8 bytes of protection information are added to each
logical block (a 2 byte &quot;logical block guard&quot;
(CRC), a 2 byte &quot;logical block application guard&quot;,
and a 4 byte &quot;logical block reference tag&quot;).
SBC&minus;3 defines 4 protection types (types 0 to 3) with
protection type 0 meaning no protection information is
maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A device that
supports protection information (i.e. supports one or more
protection types of 1 or higher) sets the
&quot;PROTECT&quot; bit in its standard INQUIRY response. It
also sets the SPT field in the EXTENDED INQUIRY VPD page
response to indicate which protection types it supports. The
current protection type of a disk can be found in the
&quot;P_TYPE&quot; and &quot;PROT_EN&quot; fields in the
response of a READ CAPACITY (16) command (e.g. with the
&rsquo;sg_readcap &minus;&minus;long&rsquo; utility).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given that a
device supports a particular protection type, a user can
then choose to format that disk with that protection type by
setting the &quot;FMTPINFO&quot; and &quot;Protection Field
Usage&quot; fields in the FORMAT UNIT command. Those fields
correspond to the <i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i> and the
<i>&minus;&minus;pfu=PFU</i> options in this utility. The
list below shows the four protection types followed by the
options of this utility needed to select them: <b><br>
0</b> : &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=0 &minus;&minus;pfu=0 <b><br>
1</b> : &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=2 &minus;&minus;pfu=0 <b><br>
2</b> : &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=3 &minus;&minus;pfu=0 <b><br>
3</b> : &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=3 &minus;&minus;pfu=1 <br>
The default value of <i>FPI</i> (in
<i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i>) is 0 and the default
value of <i>PFU</i> (in <i>&minus;&minus;pfu=PFU</i>) is 0.
So if neither <i>&minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=FPI</i> nor
<i>&minus;&minus;pfu=PFU</i> are given then protection type
0 (i.e. no protection information) is chosen.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SBC&minus;2
standard states that the REQUEST SENSE command should be
used for obtaining progress indication when the format
command is underway. However, tests on a selection of disks
shows that TEST UNIT READY commands yield progress
indications (but not REQUEST SENSE commands). So the current
version of this utility defaults to using TEST UNIT READY
commands to poll the disk to find out the progress of the
format. The <i>&minus;&minus;poll=PT</i> option has been
added to control this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<i>&minus;&minus;format</i> option is given without the
<i>&minus;&minus;wait</i> option then the SCSI FORMAT UNIT
command is issued with the IMMED bit set which causes the
SCSI command to return after it has started the format
operation. The <i>&minus;&minus;early</i> option will cause
sg_format to exit at that point. Otherwise the <i>DEVICE</i>
is polled every 60 seconds with TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST
SENSE commands until it reports an &quot;all clear&quot;
(i.e. the format operation has completed). Normally these
polling commands will result in a progress indicator
(expressed as a percentage) being output to the screen. If
the user gets bored watching the progress report then
sg_format process can be terminated (e.g. with
control&minus;C) without affecting the format operation
which continues. However a target or device reset (or a
power cycle) will probably cause the device to become
&quot;format corrupt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<i>&minus;&minus;format</i> and <i>&minus;&minus;wait</i>
options are both given then this utility may take a long
time to return. In this case care should be taken not to
send any other SCSI commands to the disk as it may not
respond leaving those commands queued behind the active
format command. This may cause a timeout in the OS driver
(in a lot shorter period than 15 hours applicable to some
format operations). This may result in the OS resetting the
disk leaving the format operation incomplete. This may leave
the disk in a &quot;format corrupt&quot; state requiring
another format to remedy the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the block
size (i.e. the number of bytes in each block) is changed on
a disk two SCSI commands must be sent: a MODE SELECT to
change the block size followed by a FORMAT command. If the
MODE SELECT command succeeds and the FORMAT fails then the
disk may be in a state that the draft standard calls
&quot;format corrupt&quot;. A block descriptor in a
subsequent MODE SENSE will report the requested new block
size while a READ CAPACITY command will report the existing
(i.e. different) block size. Alternatively the READ CAPACITY
command may fail, reporting the device is not ready,
potentially requiring a format. The solution to this
situation is to do a format again (and this time the new
block size does not have to be given) or change the block
size back to the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SBC&minus;2
standard states that the block count can be set back to the
manufacturer&rsquo;s maximum recommended value in a format
or resize operation. This can be done by placing an address
of 0xffffffff (or the 64 bit equivalent) in the appropriate
block descriptor field to a MODE SELECT command. In signed
(two&rsquo;s complement) arithmetic that value corresponds
to the manufacturer&rsquo;s maximum recommended value. To
see exactly which SCSI commands are being executed and
parameters passed add the &quot;&minus;vvv&quot; option to
the sg_format command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Short stroking
is a technique to trade off capacity for performance.
Rotating disk performance is usually highest on the outer
tracks (i.e. lower logical block addresses) so by resizing
or reformatting a disk to a smaller capacity, average
performance will usually be increased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other utilities
may be useful in finding information associated with
formatting. These include sg_inq(8) to fetch standard
INQUIRY information (e.g. the PROTECT bit) and to fetch the
EXTENDED INQUIRY VPD page (e.g. RTO and GRD_CHK bits). The
sdparm(8) utility can be used to access and potentially
change the now obsolete format mode page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">scsiformat is
another utility available for formatting SCSI disks with
Linux. It dates from 1997 (most recent update) and may be
useful for disks whose firmware is of that vintage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>COUNT</i> numeric argument may include a multiplicative
suffix or be given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC
ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SCSI
SANITIZE command was introduced in SBC&minus;3 revision 27.
It is closely related to the ATA sanitize disk feature set
and can be used to remove all existing data from a disk.
Sanitize is more likely to be implemented on modern disks
(including SSDs) than FORMAT UNIT&rsquo;s security
initialization feature (see the
<i>&minus;&minus;security</i> option) and in some cases much
faster.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These examples
use Linux device names. For suitable device names in other
supported Operating Systems see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
example below simply find out the existing block count and
size derived from two sources: a block descriptor in a MODE
SELECT command response and from the response of a READ
CAPACITY commands. No changes are made:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_format
/dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now a simple
format, leaving the block count and size as they were
previously. The FORMAT UNIT command is executed in IMMED
mode and the device is polled every 60 seconds to print out
a progress indication:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_format
&minus;&minus;format /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now the same

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next is a
format in which the block size is changed to 520 bytes and
the block count is set to the manufacturer&rsquo;s maximum
value (for that block size). Note, not all disks support
changing the block size:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now a resize
operation so that only the first 0x10000 (65536) blocks on a
disk are accessible. The remaining blocks remain
unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now resize the
disk back to its normal (maximum) block count:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One reason to
format a SCSI disk is to add protection information. First
check which protection types are supported by a disk (by
checking the SPT field in the Extended inquiry VPD page
together with the Protect bit in the standard inquiry
response):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_vpd
&minus;p ei &minus;l /dev/sdb <br>
extended INQUIRY data VPD page: <br>
ACTIVATE_MICROCODE=0 <br>
SPT=1 [protection types 1 and 2 supported] <br>
....</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Format with
type 1 protection:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_format
&minus;&minus;format &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=2 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After a
successful format with type 1 protection, READ CAPACITY(16)
should show something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_readcap
&minus;l /dev/sdm <br>
Read Capacity results: <br>
Protection: prot_en=1, p_type=0, p_i_exponent=0 [type 1
protection] <br>
Logical block provisioning: lbpme=0, lbprz=0 <br>
....</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To format with
type 3 protection:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sg_format
&minus;&minus;format &minus;&minus;fmtpinfo=3
&minus;&minus;pfu=1 /dev/sdm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the disk
shown above this will probably fail because the Extended
inquiry VPD page showed only types 1 and 2 protection are
supported.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
of sg_format is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
sg3_utils(8) man page. Unless the <i>&minus;&minus;wait</i>
option is given, the exit status may not reflect the success
of otherwise of the format. Using sg_turs(8) and
sg_readcap(8) after the format operation may be wise.</p>
