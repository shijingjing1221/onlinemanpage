<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>Unbound&minus;control</b></i>
performs remote administration on the <i>unbound</i>(8) DNS
server. It reads the configuration file, contacts the
unbound server over SSL sends the command and displays the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The available
options are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<td width="9%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>
<i>cfgfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The config file to read with
settings. If not given the default config file
/etc/unbound/unbound.conf is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>server[@port]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">IPv4 or IPv6 address of the
server to contact. If not given, the address is read from
the config file.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several commands that the server understands.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>start</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start the server. Simply execs
<i>unbound</i>(8). The unbound executable is searched for in
the <b>PATH</b> set in the environment. It is started with
the config file specified using <i>&minus;c</i> or the
default config file.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>stop</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Stop the server. The server daemon exits.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>reload</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Reload the server. This flushes the cache and reads the
config file fresh.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>verbosity</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change verbosity value for
logging. Same values as <b>verbosity</b> keyword in
<i>unbound.conf</i>(5). This new setting lasts until the
server is issued a reload (taken from config file again), or
the next verbosity control command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>log_reopen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reopen the logfile, close and
open it. Useful for logrotation to make the daemon release
the file it is logging to. If you are using syslog it will
attempt to close and open the syslog (which may not work if
chrooted).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>stats</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Print statistics. Resets the internal counters to zero,
this can be controlled using the
<b>statistics&minus;cumulative</b> config statement.
Statistics are printed with one [name]: [value] per
line.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stats_noreset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Peek at statistics. Prints them
like the <b>stats</b> command does, but does not reset the
internal counters to zero.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>status</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Display server status. Exit code 3 if not running (the
connection to the port is refused), 1 on error, 0 if
running.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local_zone</b> <i>name
type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add new local zone with name
and type. Like <b>local&minus;zone</b> config statement. If
the zone already exists, the type is changed to the given
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local_zone_remove</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove the local zone with the
given name. Removes all local data inside it. If the zone
does not exist, the command succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local_data</b> <i>RR
data...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add new local data, the given
resource record. Like <b>local&minus;data</b> config
statement, except for when no covering zone exists. In that
case this remote control command creates a transparent zone
with the same name as this record. This command is not good
at returning detailed syntax errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>local_data_remove</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove all RR data from local
name. If the name already has no items, nothing happens.
Often results in NXDOMAIN for the name (in a static zone),
but if the name has become an empty nonterminal (there is
still data in domain names below the removed name), NOERROR
nodata answers are the result for that name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dump_cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The contents of the cache is
printed in a text format to stdout. You can redirect it to a
file to store the cache in a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>load_cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The contents of the cache is
loaded from stdin. Uses the same format as dump_cache uses.
Loading the cache with old, or wrong data can result in old
or wrong data returned to clients. Loading data into the
cache in this way is supported in order to aid with
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>lookup</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print to stdout the name
servers that would be used to look up the name
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove the name from the cache.
Removes the types A, AAAA, NS, SOA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, PTR,
SRV and NAPTR. Because that is fast to do. Other record
types can be removed using <b>flush_type</b> or
<b>flush_zone</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_type</b> <i>name
type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove the name, type
information from the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_zone</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove all information at or
below the name from the cache. The rrsets and key entries
are removed so that new lookups will be performed. This
needs to walk and inspect the entire cache, and is a slow
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_bogus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove all bogus data from the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_stats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reset statistics to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_requestlist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Drop the queries that are
worked on. Stops working on the queries that the server is
working on now. The cache is unaffected. No reply is sent
for those queries, probably making those users request again
later. Useful to make the server restart working on queries
with new settings, such as a higher verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dump_requestlist</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show what is worked on. Prints
all queries that the server is currently working on. Prints
the time that users have been waiting. For internal
requests, no time is printed. And then prints out the module
status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush_infra</b>
<i>all|IP</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If all then entire infra cache
is emptied. If a specific IP address, the entry for that
address is removed from the cache. It contains EDNS, ping
and lameness data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dump_infra</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show the contents of the infra
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>set_option</b> <i>opt:
val</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the option to the given
value without a reload. The cache is therefore not flushed.
The option must end with a &rsquo;:&rsquo; and whitespace
must be between the option and the value. Some values may
not have an effect if set this way, the new values are not
written to the config file, not all options are supported.
This is different from the set_option call in libunbound,
where all values work because unbound has not been
inited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The values that
work are: statistics&minus;interval,
statistics&minus;cumulative,
do&minus;not&minus;query&minus;localhost,
harden&minus;short&minus;bufsize,
harden&minus;large&minus;queries, harden&minus;glue,
harden&minus;dnssec&minus;stripped,
harden&minus;below&minus;nxdomain,
harden&minus;referral&minus;path, prefetch,
prefetch&minus;key, log&minus;queries, hide&minus;identity,
hide&minus;version, identity, version,
val&minus;log&minus;level, val&minus;log&minus;squelch,
ignore&minus;cd&minus;flag, add&minus;holddown,
del&minus;holddown, keep&minus;missing, tcp&minus;upstream,
ssl&minus;upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>get_option</b>
<i>opt</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get the value of the option.
Give the option name without a trailing &rsquo;:&rsquo;. The
value is printed. If the value is &quot;&quot;, nothing is
printed and the connection closes. On error &rsquo;error
...&rsquo; is printed (it gives a syntax error on unknown
option). For some options a list of values, one on each
line, is printed. The options are shown from the config file
as modified with set_option. For some options an override
may have been taken that does not show up with this command,
not results from e.g. the verbosity and forward control
commands. Not all options work, see list_stubs,
list_forwards, list_local_zones and list_local_data for
those.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>list_stubs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the stub zones in use.
These are printed one by one to the output. This includes
the root hints in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>list_forwards</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the forward zones in use.
These are printed zone by zone to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>list_local_zones</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the local zones in use.
These are printed one per line with zone type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>list_local_data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the local data RRs in use.
The resource records are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward_add</b> [<i>+i</i>]
<i>zone addr ...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a new forward zone to
running unbound. With +i option also adds a
<i>domain&minus;insecure</i> for the zone (so it can resolve
insecurely if you have a DNSSEC root trust anchor configured
for other names). The addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver
names, like <i>forward-zone</i> config in unbound.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward_remove</b>
[<i>+i</i>] <i>zone</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove a forward zone from
running unbound. The +i also removes a
<i>domain&minus;insecure</i> for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub_add</b> [<i>+ip</i>]
<i>zone addr ...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a new stub zone to running
unbound. With +i option also adds a
<i>domain&minus;insecure</i> for the zone. With +p the stub
zone is set to prime, without it it is set to notprime. The
addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver names, like the
<i>stub-zone</i> config in unbound.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stub_remove</b> [<i>+i</i>]
<i>zone</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove a stub zone from running
unbound. The +i also removes a <i>domain&minus;insecure</i>
for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>forward</b> [<i>off</i> |
<i>addr ...</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Setup forwarding mode.
Configures if the server should ask other upstream
nameservers, should go to the internet root nameservers
itself, or show the current config. You could pass the
nameservers after a DHCP update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without
arguments the current list of addresses used to forward all
queries to is printed. On startup this is from the
forward&minus;zone &quot;.&quot; configuration. Afterwards
it shows the status. It prints off when no forwarding is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>off</i>
is passed, forwarding is disabled and the root nameservers
are used. This can be used to avoid to avoid buggy or
non&minus;DNSSEC supporting nameservers returned from DHCP.
But may not work in hotels or hotspots.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If one or more
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are given, those are then used to
forward queries to. The addresses must be separated with
spaces. With &rsquo;@port&rsquo; the port number can be set
explicitly (default port is 53 (DNS)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default the
forwarder information from the config file for the root
&quot;.&quot; is used. The config file is not changed, so
after a reload these changes are gone. Other forward zones
from the config file are not affected by this command.</p>

<h2>EXIT CODE
<a name="EXIT CODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
unbound&minus;control program exits with status code 1 on
error, 0 on success.</p>

<h2>SET UP
<a name="SET UP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The setup
requires a self&minus;signed certificate and private keys
for both the server and client. The script
<i>unbound&minus;control&minus;setup</i> generates these in
the default run directory, or with &minus;d in another
directory. If you change the access control permissions on
the key files you can decide who can use
unbound&minus;control, by default owner and group but not
all users. Run the script under the same username as you
have configured in unbound.conf or as root, so that the
daemon is permitted to read the files, for example with:
<br>
sudo &minus;u unbound unbound&minus;control&minus;setup <br>
If you have not configured a username in unbound.conf, the
keys need read permission for the user credentials under
which the daemon is started. The script preserves private
keys present in the directory. After running the script as
root, turn on <b>control&minus;enable</b> in
<i>unbound.conf</i>.</p>

<h2>STATISTIC COUNTERS
<a name="STATISTIC COUNTERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>stats</i> command shows a number of statistic counters.
<i><br>
threadX.num.queries</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">number of queries received by
thread</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.num.cachehits</i></p>

successfully answered using a cache lookup</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.num.cachemiss</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">number of queries that needed
recursive processing</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.num.prefetch</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">number of cache prefetches
performed. This number is included in cachehits, as the
original query had the unprefetched answer from cache, and
resulted in recursive processing, taking a slot in the
requestlist. Not part of the recursivereplies (or the
histogram thereof) or cachemiss, as a cache response was
sent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.num.recursivereplies</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of replies sent to
queries that needed recursive processing. Could be smaller
than threadX.num.cachemiss if due to timeouts no replies
were sent for some queries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.avg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The average number of requests
in the internal recursive processing request list on insert
of a new incoming recursive processing query.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum size attained by the
internal recursive processing request list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.overwritten</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of requests in the
request list that were overwritten by newer entries. This
happens if there is a flood of queries that recursive
processing and the server has a hard time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.exceeded</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Queries that were dropped
because the request list was full. This happens if a flood
of queries need recursive processing, and the server can not
keep up.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.current.all</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Current size of the request
list, includes internally generated queries (such as priming
queries and glue lookups).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.requestlist.current.user</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Current size of the request
list, only the requests from client queries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.recursion.time.avg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Average time it took to answer
queries that needed recursive processing. Note that queries
that were answered from the cache are not in this
average.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>threadX.recursion.time.median</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The median of the time it took
to answer queries that needed recursive processing. The
median means that 50% of the user queries were answered in
less than this time. Because of big outliers (usually
queries to non responsive servers), the average can be
bigger than the median. This median has been calculated by
interpolation from a histogram.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>total.num.queries</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">summed over threads.</p>

doubling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.query.type.A</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The total number of queries

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.query.edns.present</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">number of queries that had an
EDNS OPT record present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.query.edns.DO</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">number of queries that had an
EDNS OPT record with the DO (DNSSEC OK) bit set. These
queries are also included in the num.query.edns.present
number.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.answer.rcode.NXDOMAIN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of answers to
queries, from cache or from recursion, that had the return
code NXDOMAIN. Also printed for the other return codes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.answer.rcode.nodata</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of answers to
queries that had the pseudo return code nodata. This means
the actual return code was NOERROR, but additionally, no
data was carried in the answer (making what is called a
NOERROR/NODATA answer). These queries are also included in
the num.answer.rcode.NOERROR number. Common for AAAA lookups
when an A record exists, and no AAAA.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.answer.secure</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of answers that were
secure. The answer validated correctly. The AD bit might
have been set in some of these answers, where the client
signalled (with DO or AD bit in the query) that they were
ready to accept the AD bit in the answer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.answer.bogus</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of answers that were
bogus. These answers resulted in SERVFAIL to the client
because the answer failed validation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>num.rrset.bogus</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of rrsets marked
bogus by the validator. Increased for every RRset inspection
that fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>unwanted.queries</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of queries that were
refused or dropped because they failed the access control
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>unwanted.replies</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Replies that were unwanted or
unsolicited. Could have been random traffic, delayed
duplicates, very late answers, or could be spoofing
attempts. Some low level of late answers and delayed
duplicates are to be expected with the UDP protocol. Very
high values could indicate a threat (spoofing).</p>
