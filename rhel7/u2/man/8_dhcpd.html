--version</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Internet
Systems Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd, implements the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP
network to request and be assigned IP addresses, and also to
discover information about the network to which they are
attached. BOOTP provides similar functionality, with certain
restrictions.</p>

<h2>OPERATION
<a name="OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP
protocol allows a host which is unknown to the network
administrator to be automatically assigned a new IP address
out of a pool of IP addresses for its network. In order for
this to work, the network administrator allocates address
pools in each subnet and enters them into the dhcpd.conf(5)
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup
the server may be started for one or the other via the
<b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On startup,
dhcpd reads the <i>dhcpd.conf</i> file and stores a list of
available addresses on each subnet in memory. When a client
requests an address using the DHCP protocol, dhcpd allocates
an address for it. Each client is assigned a lease, which
expires after an amount of time chosen by the administrator
(by default, one day). Before leases expire, the clients to
which leases are assigned are expected to renew them in
order to continue to use the addresses. Once a lease has
expired, the client to which that lease was assigned is no
longer permitted to use the leased IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
keep track of leases across system reboots and server
restarts, dhcpd keeps a list of leases it has assigned in
the dhcpd.leases(5) file. Before dhcpd grants a lease to a
host, it records the lease in this file and makes sure that
the contents of the file are flushed to disk. This ensures
that even in the event of a system crash, dhcpd will not
forget about a lease that it has assigned. On startup, after
reading the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd reads the dhcpd.leases
file to refresh its memory about what leases have been
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New leases are
appended to the end of the dhcpd.leases file. In order to
prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from time
to time dhcpd creates a new dhcpd.leases file from its
in-core lease database. Once this file has been written to
disk, the old file is renamed <i>dhcpd.leases~</i>, and the
new file is renamed dhcpd.leases. If the system crashes in
the middle of this process, whichever dhcpd.leases file
remains will contain all the lease information, so there is
no need for a special crash recovery process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BOOTP support
is also provided by this server. Unlike DHCP, the BOOTP
protocol does not provide a protocol for recovering
dynamically-assigned addresses once they are no longer
needed. It is still possible to dynamically assign addresses
to BOOTP clients, but some administrative process for
reclaiming addresses is required. By default, leases are
granted to BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although the network
administrator may set an earlier cutoff date or a shorter
lease length for BOOTP leases if that makes sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BOOTP clients
may also be served in the old standard way, which is to
simply provide a declaration in the dhcpd.conf file for each
BOOTP client, permanently assigning an address to each
client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever
changes are made to the dhcpd.conf file, dhcpd must be
restarted. To restart dhcpd, send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to
the process ID contained in <i>/var/run/dhcpd.pid</i>, and
then re-invoke dhcpd. Because the DHCP server database is
not as lightweight as a BOOTP database, dhcpd does not
automatically restart itself when it sees a change to the
dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: We get a
lot of complaints about this. We realize that it would be
nice if one could send a SIGHUP to the server and have it
reload the database. This is not technically impossible, but
it would require a great deal of work, our resources are
extremely limited, and they can be better spent elsewhere.
So please don&rsquo;t complain about this on the mailing
list unless you&rsquo;re prepared to fund a project to
implement this feature, or prepared to do it yourself.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE
<a name="COMMAND LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
the network interfaces on which dhcpd should listen for
broadcasts may be specified on the command line. This should
be done on systems where dhcpd is unable to identify
non-broadcast interfaces, but should not be required on
other systems. If no interface names are specified on the
command line dhcpd will identify all network interfaces
which are up, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and listen for DHCP broadcasts on each
interface.</p>

the default port of 67. This is mostly useful for debugging
purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s&nbsp;</b><i>address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an address or host name

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a file into which the
entire startup state of the server and all the transactions
it processes are logged. This can be useful in submitting
bug reports - if you are getting a core dump every so often,
you can start the server with the <b>-tf</b> option and
then, when the server dumps core, the trace file will
contain all the transactions that led up to it dumping core,
so that the problem can be easily debugged with
<b>-play</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;play&nbsp;</b><i>playfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify a file from which the
entire startup state of the server and all the transactions
it processed are read. The <b>-play</b> option must be
specified with an alternate lease file, using the <b>-lf</b>
switch, so that the DHCP server doesn&rsquo;t wipe out your
existing lease file with its test data. The DHCP server will
refuse to operate in playback mode unless you specify an
alternate lease file.</p>

processing the command line arguments, but before reading
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Modifying
default file locations:</i> The following options can be
used to modify the locations <b>dhcpd</b> uses for
it&rsquo;s files. Because of the importance of using the
same lease database at all times when running dhcpd in
production, these options should be used <b>only</b> for
testing lease files or database files in a non-production
environment. <b><br>
&minus;cf&nbsp;</b><i>config-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to alternate lease
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pf&nbsp;</b><i>pid-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to alternate pid file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-no-pid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Option to disable writing pid
files. By default the program will write a pid file. If the
program is invoked with this option it will not check for an
existing server process.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed separately. This section
should be used as an overview of the configuration process,
and the dhcpd.conf(5) documentation should be consulted for
detailed reference information.</p>

<h2>Subnets
<a name="Subnets"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dhcpd needs to
know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all subnets for
which it will be providing service. In addition, in order to
dynamically allocate addresses, it must be assigned one or
more ranges of addresses on each subnet which it can in turn
assign to client hosts as they boot. Thus, a very simple
configuration providing DHCP support might look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">subnet
239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>}</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
address ranges may be specified like this:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>}</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a subnet
will only be provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic
address assignment, the range clause can be left out
entirely, but the subnet statement must appear.</p>

<h2>Lease Lengths
<a name="Lease Lengths"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DHCP leases can
be assigned almost any length from zero seconds to infinity.
What lease length makes sense for any given subnet, or for
any given installation, will vary depending on the kinds of
hosts being served.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, in
an office environment where systems are added from time to
time and removed from time to time, but move relatively
infrequently, it might make sense to allow lease times of a
month or more. In a final test environment on a
manufacturing floor, it may make more sense to assign a
maximum lease length of 30 minutes - enough time to go
through a simple test procedure on a network appliance
before packaging it up for delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to specify two lease lengths: the default length that will
be assigned if a client doesn&rsquo;t ask for any particular
lease length, and a maximum lease length. These are
specified as clauses to the subnet command:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>default-lease-time 600;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>max-lease-time 7200;</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>}</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This particular
subnet declaration specifies a default lease time of 600
seconds (ten minutes), and a maximum lease time of 7200
seconds (two hours). Other common values would be 86400 (one
day), 604800 (one week) and 2592000 (30 days).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each subnet
need not have the same lease&mdash;in the case of an office
environment and a manufacturing environment served by the
same DHCP server, it might make sense to have widely
disparate values for default and maximum lease times on each
subnet.</p>

<h2>BOOTP Support
<a name="BOOTP Support"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each BOOTP
client must be explicitly declared in the dhcpd.conf file. A
very basic client declaration will specify the client
network interface&rsquo;s hardware address and the IP
address to assign to that client. If the client needs to be
able to load a boot file from the server, that file&rsquo;s
name must be specified. A simple bootp client declaration
might look like this:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>

<td width="92%">


<p>}</p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Options
<a name="Options"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DHCP (and also
BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a mechanism whereby
the server can provide the client with information about how
to configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and
also how the client can access various network services
(e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
can be specified on a per-subnet basis, and, for BOOTP
clients, also on a per-client basis. In the event that a
BOOTP client declaration specifies options that are also
specified in its subnet declaration, the options specified
in the client declaration take precedence. A reasonably
complete DHCP configuration might look something like
this:</p>

<h2>OMAPI
<a name="OMAPI"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP server
provides the capability to modify some of its configuration
while it is running, without stopping it, modifying its
database files, and restarting it. This capability is
currently provided using OMAPI - an API for manipulating
remote objects. OMAPI clients connect to the server using
TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then examine the
server&rsquo;s current status and make changes to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rather than
implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user
programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl
is a wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores
that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl and OMAPI are
documented in <b>dhcpctl(3)</b> and <b>omapi(3)</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OMAPI exports
objects, which can then be examined and modified. The DHCP
server exports the following objects: lease, host,
failover-state and group. Each object has a number of
methods that are provided: lookup, create, and destroy. In
addition, it is possible to look at attributes that are
stored on objects, and in some cases to modify those
attributes.</p>

<h2>THE LEASE OBJECT
<a name="THE LEASE OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Leases
can&rsquo;t currently be created or destroyed, but they can
be looked up to examine and modify their state.</p>

following attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>state</b>
<i>integer</i> lookup, examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">1 = free <br>

<i>data</i> lookup, examine, update</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The client identifier that the
client used when it acquired the lease. Not all clients send
client identifiers, so this may be empty.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>client-hostname</b>
<i>data</i> examine, update</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The value the client sent in
the host-name option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>host</b>
<i>handle</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the host declaration associated
with this lease, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>subnet</b>
<i>handle</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the subnet object associated
with this lease (the subnet object is not currently
supported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pool</b>
<i>handle</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the pool object associated with
this lease (the pool object is not currently supported).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>billing-class</b>
<i>handle</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the handle to the class to

object is not currently supported).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hardware-address</b>
<i>data</i> examine, update</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the hardware address (chaddr)

current state ends, as understood by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tsfp</b> <i>time</i>
examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the adjusted time when the
lease&rsquo;s current state ends, as understood by the
failover peer (if there is no failover peer, this value is
undefined). Generally this value is only adjusted for
expired, released, or reset leases while the server is
operating in partner-down state, and otherwise is simply the
value supplied by the peer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>atsfp</b> <i>time</i>
examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the actual tsfp value sent from
the peer. This value is forgotten when a lease binding state
change is made, to facilitate retransmission logic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cltt</b>
<i>time</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The time of the last
transaction with the client on this lease.</p>

<h2>THE HOST OBJECT
<a name="THE HOST OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hosts can be
created, destroyed, looked up, examined and modified. If a
host declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI, that
information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases file. It is
permissible to delete host declarations that are declared in
the dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hosts have the
following attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>name</b>
<i>data</i> lookup, examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the named group associated with
the host declaration, if there is one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hardware-address</b>
<i>data</i> lookup, examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the link-layer address that
will be used to match the client, if any. Only valid if
hardware-type is also present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hardware-type</b>
<i>integer</i> lookup, examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the type of the network
interface that will be used to match the client, if any.
Only valid if hardware-address is also present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dhcp-client-identifier</b>
<i>data</i> lookup, examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the dhcp-client-identifier
option that will be used to match the client, if any.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ip-address</b>
<i>data</i> examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">a fixed IP address which is
reserved for a DHCP client that matches this host
declaration. The IP address will only be assigned to the
client if it is valid for the network segment to which the
client is connected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>statements</b>
<i>data</i> modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">a list of statements in the
format of the dhcpd.conf file that will be executed whenever
a message from the client is being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>known</b>
<i>integer</i> examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">if nonzero, indicates that a
client matching this host declaration will be treated as
<i>known</i> in pool permit lists. If zero, the client will
not be treated as known.</p>

<h2>THE GROUP OBJECT
<a name="THE GROUP OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Named groups
can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and modified.
If a group declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI,
that information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases file.
It is permissible to delete group declarations that are
declared in the dhcpd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Named groups
currently can only be associated with hosts - this allows
one set of statements to be efficiently attached to more
than one host declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Groups have the
following attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>name</b>
<i>data</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">the name of the group. All
groups that are created using OMAPI must have names, and the
names must be unique among all groups.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>statements</b>
<i>data</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">a list of statements in the
format of the dhcpd.conf file that will be executed whenever
a message from a client whose host declaration references
this group is processed.</p>

<h2>THE CONTROL OBJECT
<a name="THE CONTROL OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
object allows you to shut the server down. If the server is
doing failover with another peer, it will make a clean
transition into the shutdown state and notify its peer, so
that the peer can go into partner down, and then record the
&quot;recover&quot; state in the lease file so that when the
server is restarted, it will automatically resynchronize
with its peer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On shutdown the
server will also attempt to cleanly shut down all OMAPI
connections. If these connections do not go down cleanly
after five seconds, they are shut down preemptively. It can
take as much as 25 seconds from the beginning of the
shutdown process to the time that the server actually
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To shut the
server down, open its control object and set the state
attribute to 2.</p>

<h2>THE FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT
<a name="THE FAILOVER-STATE OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
failover-state object is the object that tracks the state of
the failover protocol as it is being managed for a given
failover peer. The failover object has the following
attributes (please see <b>dhcpd.conf (5)</b> for
explanations about what these attributes mean):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>name</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the name of the
failover peer relationship, as described in the
server&rsquo;s <b>dhcpd.conf</b> file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>partner-address</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the failover
partner&rsquo;s IP address.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>local-address</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the IP address that
is being used by the DHCP server for this failover pair.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>partner-port</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the TCP port on which
the failover partner is listening for failover protocol
connections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>local-port</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the TCP port on which
the DHCP server is listening for failover protocol
connections for this failover pair.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>max-outstanding-updates</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the number of updates
that can be outstanding and unacknowledged at any given
time, in this failover relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mclt</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the maximum client
lead time in this failover relationship.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>load-balance-max-secs</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the maximum value for
the secs field in a client request before load balancing is
bypassed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>load-balance-hba</b>
<i>data</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the load balancing
hash bucket array for this failover relationship.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>local-state</b>
<i>integer</i> examine, modify</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the present state of
the DHCP server in this failover relationship. Possible
values for state are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">1 - startup
<br>
2 - normal <br>
3 - communications interrupted <br>
4 - partner down <br>
5 - potential conflict <br>
6 - recover <br>
7 - paused <br>
8 - shutdown <br>
9 - recover done <br>
10 - resolution interrupted <br>
11 - conflict done <br>
254 - recover wait</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that some
of the above values have changed since DHCP 3.0.x.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In general it
is not a good idea to make changes to this state. However,
in the case that the failover partner is known to be down,
it can be useful to set the DHCP server&rsquo;s failover
state to partner down. At this point the DHCP server will
take over service of the failover partner&rsquo;s leases as
soon as possible, and will give out normal leases, not
leases that are restricted by MCLT. If you do put the DHCP
server into the partner-down when the other DHCP server is
not in the partner-down state, but is not reachable, IP
address assignment conflicts are possible, even likely. Once
a server has been put into partner-down mode, its failover
partner must not be brought back online until communication
is possible between the two servers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>partner-state</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the present state of

<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the time at which the
failover partner entered its present state.</p>

<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates whether the DHCP
server is primary (0) or secondary (1) in this failover
relationship.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>last-packet-sent</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the time at which the
most recent failover packet was sent by this DHCP server to
its failover partner.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>last-timestamp-received</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Indicates the timestamp that
was on the failover message most recently received from the
failover partner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>skew</b>
<i>integer</i> examine</p>
