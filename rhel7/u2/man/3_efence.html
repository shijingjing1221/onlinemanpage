<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Electric
Fence</i></b> helps you detect two common programming bugs:
software that overruns the boundaries of a malloc() memory
allocation, and software that touches a memory allocation
that has been released by free(). Unlike other malloc()
debuggers, Electric Fence will detect <i>read</i> accesses
as well as writes, and it will pinpoint the exact
instruction that causes an error. It has been in use at
Pixar since 1987, and at many other sites for years.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Electric Fence
uses the virtual memory hardware of your computer to place
an inaccessible memory page immediately after (or before, at
the user&rsquo;s option) each memory allocation. When
software reads or writes this inaccessible page, the
hardware issues a segmentation fault, stopping the program
at the offending instruction. It is then trivial to find the
erroneous statement using your favorite debugger. In a
similar manner, memory that has been released by free() is
made inaccessible, and any code that touches it will get a
segmentation fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Simply linking
your application with libefence.a will allow you to detect
most, but not all, malloc buffer overruns and accesses of
free memory. If you want to be reasonably sure that
you&rsquo;ve found <i>all</i> bugs of this type,
you&rsquo;ll have to read and understand the rest of this
man page.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Link your
program with the library <b>libefence.a .</b> Make sure you
are <i>not</i> linking with <b>-lmalloc, -lmallocdebug,</b>
or with other malloc-debugger or malloc-enhancer libraries.
You can only use one at a time. If your system administrator
has installed Electric Fence for public use, you&rsquo;ll be
able to use the <b>-lefence</b> argument to the linker,
otherwise you&rsquo;ll have to put the path-name for
<b>libefence.a</b> in the linker&rsquo;s command line. You
can also use dynamic linking. If you&rsquo;re using a Bourne
shell, the statement <b>export
LD_PRELOAD=libefence.so.0.0</b> will cause Electric Fence to
be loaded to run all dynamic executables. The command
<b>ef</b> <i>command</i> runs a single command under
Electric Fence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some systems
will require special arguments to the linker to assure that
you are using the Electric Fence malloc() and not the one
from your C library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Run your
program <i>using a debugger.</i> It&rsquo;s easier to work
this way than to create a <b>core</b> file and post-mortem
debug it. Electric Fence can create <i>huge</i> core files,
and some operating systems will thus take minutes simply to
dump core! Some operating systems will not create usable
core files from programs that are linked with Electric
Fence. If your program has one of the errors detected by
Electric Fence, it will get a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV)
at the offending instruction. Use the debugger to locate the
erroneous statement, and repair it.</p>

<h2>GLOBAL AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="GLOBAL AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Electric Fence
has four configuration switches that can be enabled via the
shell environment, or by setting the value of global integer
variables using a debugger. These switches change what bugs
Electric Fence will detect, so it&rsquo;s important that you
know how to use them. <br>
EF_ALIGNMENT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is an integer that
specifies the alignment for any memory allocations that will
be returned by malloc(), calloc(), and realloc(). The value
is specified in bytes, thus a value of 4 will cause memory
to be aligned to 32-bit boundaries unless your system
doesn&rsquo;t have a 8-bit characters. EF_ALIGNMENT is set
to sizeof(int) by default, since that is generally the
word-size of your CPU. If your program requires that
allocations be aligned to 64-bit boundaries and you have a
32-bit <b>int</b> you&rsquo;ll have to set this value to 8.
This is the case when compiling with the <b>-mips2</b> flag
on MIPS-based systems such as those from SGI. The memory
allocation that is returned by Electric Fence malloc() is
aligned using the value in EF_ALIGNMENT, and <i>its size the
multiple of that value</i> that is greater than or equal to
the requested size. For this reason, you will sometimes want
to set EF_ALIGNMENT to 0 (no alignment), so that you can
detect overruns of less than your CPU&rsquo;s word size. Be
sure to read the section <i>WORD-ALIGNMENT AND OVERRUN
DETECTION</i> in this manual page before you try this. To
change this value, set EF_ALIGNMENT in the shell environment
to an integer value, or assign to the global integer
variable EF_ALIGNMENT using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">EF_PROTECT_BELOW</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Electric Fence usually places
an inaccessible page immediately after each memory
allocation, so that software that runs past the end of the
allocation will be detected. Setting EF_PROTECT_BELOW to 1
causes Electric Fence to place the inaccessible page
<i>before</i> the allocation in the address space, so that
under-runs will be detected instead of over-runs. When
EF_PROTECT_BELOW is set, the EF_ALIGNMENT parameter is
ignored. All allocations will be aligned to
virtual-memory-page boundaries, and their size will be the
exact size that was requested. To change this value, set
EF_PROTECT_BELOW in the shell environment to an integer
value, or assign to the global integer variable
EF_PROTECT_BELOW using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">EF_PROTECT_FREE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Electric Fence usually returns
free memory to a pool from which it may be re-allocated. If
you suspect that a program may be touching free memory, set
EF_PROTECT_FREE to 1. This will cause Electric Fence to
never re-allocate memory once it has been freed, so that any
access to free memory will be detected. Some programs will
use tremendous amounts of memory when this parameter is set.
To change this value, set EF_PROTECT_FREE in the shell
environment to an integer value, or assign to the global
integer variable EF_PROTECT_FREE using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, Electric Fence
traps calls to malloc() with a size of zero, because they
are often the result of a software bug. If EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0
is non-zero, the software will not trap calls to malloc()
with a size of zero. To change this value, set
EF_ALLOC_MALLOC_0 in the shell environment to an integer
value, or assign to the global integer variable
EF_ALLOC_MALLOC_0 using a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">EF_FILL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set to a value between 0
and 255, every byte of allocated memory is initialized to
that value. This can help detect reads of uninitialized
memory. When set to -1, some memory is filled with zeroes
(the operating system default on most systems) and some
memory will retain the values written to it during its last
use.</p>

<h2>WORD-ALIGNMENT AND OVERRUN DETECTION
<a name="WORD-ALIGNMENT AND OVERRUN DETECTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
conflict between the alignment restrictions that malloc()
operates under and the debugging strategy used by Electric
Fence. When detecting overruns, Electric Fence malloc()
allocates two or more virtual memory pages for each
allocation. The last page is made inaccessible in such a way
that any read, write, or execute access will cause a
segmentation fault. Then, Electric Fence malloc() will
return an address such that the first byte after the end of
the allocation is on the inaccessible page. Thus, any
overrun of the allocation will cause a segmentation
fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It follows that
the address returned by malloc() is the address of the
inaccessible page minus the size of the memory allocation.
Unfortunately, malloc() is required to return
<i>word-aligned</i> allocations, since many CPUs can only
access a word when its address is aligned. The conflict
happens when software makes a memory allocation using a size
that is not a multiple of the word size, and expects to do
word accesses to that allocation. The location of the
inaccessible page is fixed by hardware at a word-aligned
address. If Electric Fence malloc() is to return an aligned
address, it must increase the size of the allocation to a
multiple of the word size. In addition, the functions
memalign() and valloc() must honor explicit specifications
on the alignment of the memory allocation, and this, as well
can only be implemented by increasing the size of the
allocation. Thus, there will be situations in which the end
of a memory allocation contains some padding space, and
accesses of that padding space will not be detected, even if
they are overruns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Electric Fence
provides the variable EF_ALIGNMENT so that the user can
control the default alignment used by malloc(), calloc(),
and realloc(). To debug overruns as small as a single byte,
you can set EF_ALIGNMENT to zero. This will result in
Electric Fence malloc() returning unaligned addresses for
allocations with sizes that are not a multiple of the word
size. This is not a problem in most cases, because compilers
must pad the size of objects so that alignment restrictions
are honored when storing those objects in arrays. The
problem surfaces when software allocates odd-sized buffers
for objects that must be word-aligned. One case of this is
software that allocates a buffer to contain a structure and
a string, and the string has an odd size (this example was
in a popular TIFF library). If word references are made to
un-aligned buffers, you will see a bus error (SIGBUS)
instead of a segmentation fault. The only way to fix this is
to re-write the offending code to make byte references or
not make odd-sized allocations, or to set EF_ALIGNMENT to
the word size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another example
of software incompatible with EF_ALIGNMENT &lt; word-size is
the strcmp() function and other string functions on SunOS
(and probably Solaris), which make word-sized accesses to
character strings, and may attempt to access up to three
bytes beyond the end of a string. These result in a
segmentation fault (SIGSEGV). The only way around this is to
use versions of the string functions that perform byte
references instead of word references.</p>

<h2>MEMORY USAGE AND EXECUTION SPEED
<a name="MEMORY USAGE AND EXECUTION SPEED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Electric
Fence uses at least two virtual memory pages for each of its
allocations, it&rsquo;s a terrible memory hog. I&rsquo;ve
sometimes found it necessary to add a swap file using
swapon(8) so that the system would have enough virtual
memory to debug my program. Also, the way we manipulate
memory results in various cache and translation buffer
entries being flushed with each call to malloc or free. The
end result is that your program will be much slower and use
more resources while you are debugging it with Electric
Fence.</p>
