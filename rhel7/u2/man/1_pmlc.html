<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmlc</b>

[<b>&minus;i</b>] [<b>&minus;n</b> <i>pmnsfile</i>]

[<b>pid</b>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmlc</b> may
be used to change those metrics and instances which a
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) writes to a Performance Co-Pilot archive
(see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1)), the frequency with which the
metrics are collected and whether the logging is mandatory,
advisory, on or off. It also reports the current logging
status of metrics and instances. <b>pmlc</b> may be used to
control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as well as those
on the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
<b>pmlc</b> operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>&minus;n</b> option is
specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
<i>pmnsfile</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>&minus;P</b> option is specified, <b>pmlc</b> will
attempt to start with a connection to the primary pmlogger
on the local host. If the <b>&minus;p</b> option is
specified, then <b>pmlc</b> will attempt to start with a
connection to the pmlogger on this TCP/IP <i>port</i>.
Alternatively, if <i>pid</i> is specified, a connection to
the pmlogger instance with that process id will be attempted
on startup. The <b>&minus;h</b> option may only be used if
<b>&minus;P, &minus;p</b> <i>port</i> or a <i>pid</i> is
also specified. In that case <b>pmlc</b> will initially
connect to the specified (remote) pmlogger instance on
<i>host</i> rather than the local host. If the connection to
the specified pmlogger instance cannot be established,
<b>pmlc</b> will start with no connection. These options
typically allow the same file of <b>pmlc</b> commands to be
directed to multiple pmlogger instances by varying the
command line arguments. Note that <b>-P</b>, <b>&minus;p</b>
<i>port</i>, <i>pid</i> and <b>&minus;h</b> are used only
when making an initial connection to a pmlogger instance.
They are not used as defaults if subsequent connections are
made interactively (see the <b>connect</b> command
below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>pmlc</b> reports the time of day according to the local
timezone on the system where <b>pmlc</b> is run. The
<b>&minus;Z</b> option changes the timezone to
<i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment variable
<b>TZ</b> as described in <b>environ</b>(5). The
<b>&minus;z</b> option changes the timezone to the timezone
of the pmlogger instance from which information is being
obtained. Only one of <b>&minus;z</b> or <b>&minus;Z</b> may
be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If standard
input is from a tty, <b>pmlc</b> is interactive, with
prompts. The <b>&minus;i</b> flag may be used to force
interactive behavior, and is typically used in conjunction
with <b>&minus;e</b> to echo all command input on standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
commands may be used: <b><br>
show</b> [ <b>loggers</b> ] [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Displays the process identities
of all pmlogger instances running on the local host (or
<i>host</i>, if specified). The primary pmlogger pid is
parenthesized because it can be referred to as
&quot;primary&quot; as well as by its pid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>connect</b> <i>pid</i> [
<b>@</b><i>host</i> ] <b><br>
connect primary</b> [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Connects <b>pmlc</b> to the
specified pmlogger process. Any existing connection to a
pmlogger instance is closed first. Each pmlogger instance
will accept at most one connection at a time, so if the
connection is successfully established, your <b>pmlc</b>
will be the only one controlling the pmlogger instance it is
connected to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>new volume</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This command works only while a
connection to a pmlogger instance is established. It tells
the pmlogger to close the current volume of the log and open
a new volume. Closed volumes may be archived, e.g. as part
of a regular log management procedure to control the size of
the physical log files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>status</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This command works only while a
connection to a pmlogger instance is established. It prints
information about the state of the pmlogger instance and its
associated log.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>timezone local</b> |
<b>logger</b> |
<b>&quot;</b><i>timezone</i><b>&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This command sets the time zone
used when times are printed. <b>local</b> means use the time
zone of the machine that <b>pmlc</b> is running on.
<b>logger</b> means use the time zone of the machine where
the pmlogger instance is running. Alternatively an explicit
<i>timezone</i> enclosed in quotes may be supplied (refer to
<b>TZ</b> in <b>environ</b>(5) for details). The default
time zone is <b>local</b> unless one of the <b>&minus;z</b>
or <b>&minus;Z</b> options has been supplied on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flush</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This command works only while a
connection to a pmlogger instance is established, and
requests the pmlogger instance to flush to disk all buffers
associated with the current archive. For old-timers,
<b>sync</b> is a synonym for <b>flush</b>. In current
versions of <b>pmlogger</b>(1) all writes are unbuffered and
aligned with the logical records in the external files, so
this command achieves nothing, but is retained for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Displays a summary of the
available commands. <b><br>
h</b> and <b>?</b> are synonyms for <b>help</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>quit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exits from <b>pmlc</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
commands query and change the logging state of metrics and
instances. They will work only if <b>pmlc</b> has a
connection to a pmlogger instance. Metrics may be specified
as fully qualified names (e.g. hinv.ncpu) or subtrees of the
PMNS (e.g. hinv) which are expanded to include all metrics
in the subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu, hinv.cpuclock, etc.). Lists
of metrics may be specified by enclosing them in braces with
spaces or a comma between metrics (e.g. {hinv.ncpu
hinv.ndisk}). Subtrees of metrics may be included in such
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each individual
metric specification may be further qualified with a space
or comma separated list of instances in square brackets
(e.g. kernel.all.load[&quot;1 minute&quot;, &quot;5
minute&quot;]). External instance names or numeric internal
instance identifiers or both may be used in the same list
(e.g. sample.colour.[red,1,&quot;blue&quot;]). If an
instance qualification is applied to a subtree of the PMNS
all of the metrics in the subtree must have the same
instance domain. Instance qualifications may not be applied
to entire lists of metrics but may appear inside such
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no instances
are specified for a metric, all instances are used. All
instances means all instances available at the time the
pmlogger instance in question fetches the metrics for
logging. If an instance domain changes over time this is not
always the same as the set of instances displayed by
<b>pmlc</b>, which can only display the currently available
instances. To prevent unintentional errors, only the
instances that are currently available to <b>pmlc</b> may
appear in instance specifications. <b><br>
query</b> <i>metriclist</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current logging state of
each metric (and instances, where applicable) in
<i>metriclist</i> is displayed. This includes the logging
state (e.g. on, maybe, off) and the logging interval for
each metric (and instance) requested. The following
abbreviations pertaining to metrics (and instances) may
appear in the output: <b>adv</b>, advisory; <b>mand</b>,
mandatory; <b>nl</b>, not in the log; <b>na</b>, in the log
but not currently available from its Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA). Where appropriate, an instance name
will appear last on a line preceded by its numeric internal
instance identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[ <b>log</b> ] <b>mandatory
on</b> <i>interval metriclist</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This form of the <b>log</b>
command turns on logging for the metrics (and any instances)
in <i>metriclist. interval</i> specifies how often the
specified metrics/instances should be logged. <b>once</b>
indicates that the metrics/instances should appear at most
once in the log. More often one would use the optional
keyword <b>every</b> followed by a positive number and one
of <b>millisecond</b> (or <b>msec</b>), <b>second</b> (or
<b>sec</b>), <b>minute</b> (or <b>min</b>), <b>hour</b> or
their plurals. <br>
Note that the keyword <b>default</b> which may be used for
the default <i>interval</i> in a <b>pmlogger</b>(1)
configuration file cannot be used in <b>pmlc</b>. <br>
Internal limitations require the <i>interval</i> to be less
than (approximately) 74 hours. An <i>interval</i> value of
zero is a synonym for <b>once</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[ <b>log</b> ] <b>mandatory
off</b> <i>metriclist</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This tells the pmlogger
instance not to log any of the metrics/instances in
<i>metriclist</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[ <b>log</b> ] <b>mandatory
maybe</b> <i>metriclist</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This tells the pmlogger
instance to honor any subsequent advisory logging requests
for the metrics/instances in <i>metriclist</i>. If the
current logging state of the metrics/instances is mandatory
(either on or off) the new state will be set to maybe
(effectively advisory off). If the current state of the
metrics/instances is already advisory (either on or off) the
state(s) for the metrics/instances will remain as they
are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[ <b>log</b> ] <b>advisory
on</b> <i>interval metriclist</i> <br>
[ <b>log</b> ] <b>advisory off</b> <i>metriclist</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Advisory logging is only
applicable if the last logging state specified for a
metric/instance was &quot;mandatory maybe&quot; (which
permits subsequent advisory logging control) or if the
logging state is already advisory. These two statements turn
advisory logging on or off (respectively) for the specified
metrics/instances. <br>
The interpretation for <i>interval</i> is as above for the
<b>mandatory</b> case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
continuation character required for commands that span
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The word
<b>at</b> may be used interchangeably with <b>@</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A request to
log all instances of a metric will supersede any prior
request to log either all or specific instances of a metric
(if the request specifies a permissible transition in the
logging state). A request to log specific instances of a
metric when all instances of a metric are already being
logged is refused by <b>pmlogger</b>.</p>

<h2>ACCESS CONTROL
<a name="ACCESS CONTROL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmlc</b> may
have restricted access to and control over
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) is unable to export its control
information to the local <b>pmcd</b>(1), then that
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) cannot cannot be connected to nor
controlled by <b>pmlc</b>. In practice, this means the
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) process has to be owned by the user
&lsquo;&lsquo;pcp&rsquo;&rsquo; and/or the group
&lsquo;&lsquo;pcp&rsquo;&rsquo;. If <b>pmlogger</b>(1) is
running on the host &lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; then use
&lsquo;&lsquo;pminfo &minus;f &minus;h foo
pmcd.pmlogger&rsquo;&rsquo; to verify that the
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) of interest is known to <b>pmcd</b>(1),
alternatively <b>pmlogger</b>(1) instances that are not
reported from the <b>pmlc show loggers @foo</b> command are
not known to <b>pmcd</b>(1) on the host
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) is launched with a configuration file
that contains an <b>[access]</b> section, then <b>pmlc</b>
will be unable to connect to that <b>pmlogger</b>(1) unless
the access controls allow <b>some</b> access from the host
where <b>pmlc</b> is being run. Minimally this requires the
<b>enquire</b> access to be permitted in the
<b>pmlogger</b>(1) access control section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>pmlc</b>
is able to connect to the <b>pmlogger</b>(1) of interest,
then the following table summarizes the permissions needed
to perform different <b>pmlc</b> commands:</p>

variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains
the local values for these variables. The <b>$PCP_CONF</b>
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in <b>pcp.conf</b>(5).</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most error or
warning messages are self-explanatory. A message of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Warning: unable to change
logging state for...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">followed by a list of metrics
(and possibly instances) indicates that <b>pmlogger</b>
refused the request for the metrics (and instances) that
appear. Any metrics (and instances) that were specified but
do not appear in the message have had their logging state
updated successfully (no news is good news). Usually this
warning results from requesting advisory logging when a
mandatory control is already in place, or requesting logging
for specific instances when all instances are already being
logged.</p>

<h2>CAVEAT
<a name="CAVEAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all
instances of a metric are being logged and a request is made
to log specific instances of the metric with the same state
and frequency, the request may appear to succeed, even
though <b>pmlogger</b> has refused the request. This is not
normally a problem, as the required information will still
be placed into the log by <b>pmlogger</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However in the
case where the metric is to be logged once, the outcome is
not what might be expected. When <b>pmlogger</b> receives a
request to log a metric once, it places the current value(s)
of the metric into the log as soon as it can, regardless of
whether the metric is already in the log. This may be used
to force values into the log. When a request to log specific
instances of a metric arrives and is refused because all
instances of the metric are already being logged,
<b>pmlogger</b> does not place values for the instances
requested into the log. It returns the current logging state
for each instance requested to <b>pmlc</b>. The requested
and returned states are identical, so <b>pmlc</b>
doesn&rsquo;t raise an error as it should.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To ensure that
only certain instances of a metric are being logged, one
should always turn off logging for all instances of the
metric prior to turning on logging for the specific
instances required.</p>
