<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ISOLATION LEVEL
{ SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ

[ NOT ] DEFERRABLE</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>SET
TRANSACTION</b> command sets the characteristics of the
current transaction. It has no effect on any subsequent
transactions. <b>SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS</b> sets the
default transaction characteristics for subsequent
transactions of a session. These defaults can be overridden
by <b>SET TRANSACTION</b> for an individual transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The available
transaction characteristics are the transaction isolation
level, the transaction access mode (read/write or
read&minus;only), and the deferrable mode. In addition, a
snapshot can be selected, though only for the current
transaction, not as a session default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The isolation
level of a transaction determines what data the transaction
can see when other transactions are running
concurrently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">READ
COMMITTED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A statement can only see rows
committed before it began. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REPEATABLE
READ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All statements of the current
transaction can only see rows committed before the first
query or data&minus;modification statement was executed in
this transaction.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SERIALIZABLE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All statements of the current
transaction can only see rows committed before the first
query or data&minus;modification statement was executed in
this transaction. If a pattern of reads and writes among
concurrent serializable transactions would create a
situation which could not have occurred for any serial
(one&minus;at&minus;a&minus;time) execution of those
transactions, one of them will be rolled back with a
serialization_failure error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The SQL standard defines one
additional level, READ UNCOMMITTED. In PostgreSQL READ
UNCOMMITTED is treated as READ COMMITTED.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The transaction
isolation level cannot be changed after the first query or
data&minus;modification statement (<b>SELECT</b>,
<b>INSERT</b>, <b>DELETE</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, <b>FETCH</b>,
or <b>COPY</b>) of a transaction has been executed. See
Chapter 13, Concurrency Control, in the documentation for
more information about transaction isolation and concurrency
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The transaction
access mode determines whether the transaction is read/write
or read&minus;only. Read/write is the default. When a
transaction is read&minus;only, the following SQL commands
are disallowed: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and COPY FROM if the
table they would write to is not a temporary table; all
CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands; COMMENT, GRANT, REVOKE,
TRUNCATE; and EXPLAIN ANALYZE and EXECUTE if the command
they would execute is among those listed. This is a
high&minus;level notion of read&minus;only that does not
prevent all writes to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DEFERRABLE
transaction property has no effect unless the transaction is
also SERIALIZABLE and READ ONLY. When all three of these
properties are selected for a transaction, the transaction
may block when first acquiring its snapshot, after which it
is able to run without the normal overhead of a SERIALIZABLE
transaction and without any risk of contributing to or being
canceled by a serialization failure. This mode is well
suited for long&minus;running reports or backups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SET
TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT command allows a new transaction to run
with the same snapshot as an existing transaction. The
pre&minus;existing transaction must have exported its
snapshot with the pg_export_snapshot function (see Section
9.26.5, &ldquo;Snapshot Synchronization Functions&rdquo;, in
the documentation). That function returns a snapshot
identifier, which must be given to SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT
to specify which snapshot is to be imported. The identifier
must be written as a string literal in this command, for
example '000003A1&minus;1'. SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT can
only be executed at the start of a transaction, before the
first query or data&minus;modification statement
(<b>SELECT</b>, <b>INSERT</b>, <b>DELETE</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>,
<b>FETCH</b>, or <b>COPY</b>) of the transaction.
Furthermore, the transaction must already be set to
SERIALIZABLE or REPEATABLE READ isolation level (otherwise,
the snapshot would be discarded immediately, since READ
COMMITTED mode takes a new snapshot for each command). If
the importing transaction uses SERIALIZABLE isolation level,
then the transaction that exported the snapshot must also
use that isolation level. Also, a non&minus;read&minus;only
serializable transaction cannot import a snapshot from a
read&minus;only transaction.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>SET
TRANSACTION</b> is executed without a prior <b>START
TRANSACTION</b> or <b>BEGIN</b>, it will appear to have no
effect, since the transaction will immediately end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to dispense with <b>SET TRANSACTION</b> by instead
specifying the desired <i>transaction_modes</i> in
<b>BEGIN</b> or <b>START TRANSACTION</b>. But that option is
not available for <b>SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The session
default transaction modes can also be set by setting the
configuration parameters default_transaction_isolation,
default_transaction_read_only, and
default_transaction_deferrable. (In fact <b>SET SESSION
CHARACTERISTICS</b> is just a verbose equivalent for setting
these variables with <b>SET</b>.) This means the defaults
can be set in the configuration file, via <b>ALTER
DATABASE</b>, etc. Consult Chapter 18, Server Configuration,
in the documentation for more information.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To begin a new
transaction with the same snapshot as an already existing
transaction, first export the snapshot from the existing
transaction. That will return the snapshot identifier, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN
TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; <br>
SELECT pg_export_snapshot(); <br>
pg_export_snapshot <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
<br>
000003A1&minus;1 <br>
(1 row)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then give the
snapshot identifier in a <b>SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT</b>
command at the beginning of the newly opened
transaction:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN
TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; <br>
SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT '000003A1&minus;1';</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These commands
are defined in the SQL standard, except for the DEFERRABLE
transaction mode and the <b>SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT</b>
form, which are PostgreSQL extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SERIALIZABLE is
the default transaction isolation level in the standard. In
PostgreSQL the default is ordinarily READ COMMITTED, but you
can change it as mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the SQL
standard, there is one other transaction characteristic that
can be set with these commands: the size of the diagnostics
area. This concept is specific to embedded SQL, and
therefore is not implemented in the PostgreSQL server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SQL
standard requires commas between successive
<i>transaction_modes</i>, but for historical reasons
PostgreSQL allows the commas to be omitted.</p>
