<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcache</b> overlay to <b>slapd</b>(8) allows caching of
LDAP search requests (queries) in a local database. For an
incoming query, the proxy cache determines its corresponding
<b>template</b>. If the template was specified as cacheable
using the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive and the request is
contained in a cached request, it is answered from the proxy
cache. Otherwise, the search is performed as usual and
cacheable search results are saved in the cache for use in
future queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A template is
defined by a filter string and an index identifying a set of
attributes. The <b>template string</b> for a query can be
obtained by removing assertion values from the RFC 4515
representation of its search filter. A query belongs to a
template if its template string and set of projected
attributes correspond to a cacheable template. Examples of
template strings are <b>(mail=)</b>, <b>(|(sn=)(cn=))</b>,
<b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The config
directives that are specific to the <b>pcache</b> overlay
can be prefixed by <b>pcache&minus;</b>, to avoid conflicts
with directives specific to the underlying database or to
other stacked overlays. This may be particularly useful for
those directives that refer to the backend used for local
storage. The following cache specific directives can be used
to configure the proxy cache: <b><br>
overlay pcache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This directive adds the proxy
cache overlay to the current backend. The proxy cache
overlay may be used with any backend but is intended for use
with the <b>ldap</b>, <b>meta</b>, and <b>sql</b> backends.
Please note that the underlying backend must have a
configured <b>rootdn.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcache &lt;database&gt;
&lt;max_entries&gt; &lt;numattrsets&gt; &lt;entry_limit&gt;
&lt;cc_period&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The directive enables proxy
caching in the current backend and sets general cache
parameters. A &lt;database&gt; backend will be used
internally to maintain the cached entries. The chosen
database will need to be configured as well, as shown below.
Cache replacement is invoked when the cache size grows to
&lt;max_entries&gt; entries and continues till the cache
size drops below this size. &lt;numattrsets&gt; should be
equal to the number of following <b>pcacheAttrset</b>
directives. Queries are cached only if they correspond to a
cacheable template (specified by the <b>pcacheTemplate</b>
directive) and the number of entries returned is less than
&lt;entry_limit&gt;. Consistency check is performed every
&lt;cc_period&gt; duration (specified in secs). In each
cycle queries with expired &quot;time to
live(<b>TTL</b>)&quot; are removed. A sample cache
configuration is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">pcache <b>bdb
10000 1 50 100</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheAttrset &lt;index&gt;
&lt;attrs...&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used to associate a set of
attributes &lt;attrs..&gt; with an &lt;index&gt;. Each
attribute set is associated with an integer from 0 to
&lt;numattrsets&gt;&minus;1. These indices are used by the
<b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive to define cacheable
templates. A set of attributes cannot be empty. A set of
attributes can contain the special attributes &quot;*&quot;
(all user attributes), &quot;+&quot; (all operational
attributes) or both; in the latter case, any other attribute
is redundant and should be avoided for clarity. A set of
attributes can contain &quot;1.1&quot; as the only
attribute; in this case, only the presence of the entries is
cached. Attributes prefixed by &quot;undef:&quot; need not
be present in the schema.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheMaxQueries
&lt;queries&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the maximum number of
queries to cache. The default is 10000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheValidate { TRUE |
FALSE }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Check whether the results of a
query being cached can actually be returned from the cache
by the proxy DSA. When enabled, the entries being returned
while caching the results of a query are checked to ensure
consistency with the schema known to the proxy DSA. In case
of failure, the query is not cached. By default, the check
is off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheOffline { TRUE | FALSE
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the cache to offline mode.
While offline, the consistency checker will be stopped and
no expirations will occur. This allows the cache contents to
be used indefinitely while the proxy is cut off from network
access to the remote DSA. The default is FALSE, i.e.
consistency checks and expirations will be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcachePersist { TRUE | FALSE
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify whether the cached
queries should be saved across restarts of the caching
proxy, to provide hot startup of the cache. Only non-expired
queries are reloaded. The default is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CAVEAT</b>:
of course, the configuration of the proxy cache must not
change across restarts; the pcache overlay does not perform
any consistency checks in this sense. In detail, this option
should be disabled unless the existing <b>pcacheAttrset</b>
and <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directives are not changed neither
in order nor in contents. If new sets and templates are
added, or if other details of the pcache overlay
configuration changed, this feature should not be
affected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheTemplate
&lt;template_string&gt; &lt;attrset_index&gt; &lt;ttl&gt;
[&lt;negttl&gt; <br>
[&lt;limitttl&gt; [&lt;ttr&gt;]]]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a cacheable template
and &quot;time to live&quot; &lt;ttl&gt; of queries
belonging to the template. An optional &lt;negttl&gt; can be
used to specify that negative results (i.e., queries that
returned zero entries) should also be cached for the
specified amount of time. Negative results are not cached by
default (&lt;negttl&gt; set to 0). An optional
&lt;limitttl&gt; can be used to specify that results hitting
a sizelimit should also be cached for the specified amount
of time. Results hitting a sizelimit are not cached by
default (&lt;limitttl&gt; set to 0). An optional &lt;ttr&gt;
&quot;time to refresh&quot; can be used to specify that
cached entries should be automatically refreshed after a
certain time. Entries will only be refreshed while they have
not expired, so the &lt;ttl&gt; should be larger than the
&lt;ttr&gt; for this option to be useful. Entries are not
refreshed by default (&lt;ttr&gt; set to 0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcacheBind
&lt;filter_template&gt; &lt;attrset_index&gt; &lt;ttr&gt;
&lt;scope&gt; &lt;base&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a template for
caching Simple Bind credentials based on an already defined
<b>pcacheTemplate</b>. The &lt;filter_template&gt; is
similar to a &lt;template_string&gt; except that it may have
some values present. Its purpose is to allow the overlay to
generate filters similar to what other applications do when
they do a Search immediately before a Bind. E.g., if a
client like nss_ldap is configured to search for a user with
the filter
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=&lt;username&gt;))&quot;
then the corresponding template
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=))&quot; should
be used here. When converted to a regular template e.g.
&quot;(&amp;(objectClass=)(uid=))&quot; this template and
the &lt;attrset_index&gt; must match an already defined
<b>pcacheTemplate</b> clause. The &quot;time to
refresh&quot; &lt;ttr&gt; determines the time interval after
which the cached credentials may be refreshed. The first
Bind request that occurs after that time will trigger the
refresh attempt. Refreshes are not performed when the
overlay is Offline. There is no &quot;time to live&quot;
parameter for the Bind credentials; the credentials will
expire according to the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> ttl. The
&lt;scope&gt; and &lt;base&gt; should match the search scope
and base used by the authentication clients. The cached
credentials are not stored in cleartext, they are hashed
using the default password hash. By default Bind caching is
not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pcachePosition { head | tail
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies whether the response
callback should be placed at the <b>tail</b> (the default)
or at the <b>head</b> (actually, wherever the stacking
sequence would make it appear) of the callback list. This
affects how the overlay interacts with other overlays, since
the proxycache overlay should be executed as early as
possible (and thus configured as late as possible), to get a
chance to return the cached results; however, if executed
early at response, it would cache entries that may be later
&quot;massaged&quot; by other databases and thus returned
<i>after</i> massaging the first time, and <i>before</i>
massaging when cached.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">There are some constraints:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">all values must
be positive;</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;entry_limit&gt;</b>
must be less than or equal to
<b>&lt;max_entries&gt;</b>;</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;numattrsets&gt;</b>
attribute sets SHOULD be defined by using the directive
<b>pcacheAttrset</b>;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">all attribute
sets SHOULD be referenced by (at least) one
<b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
adds a template with filter string
<b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b> and attributes mail,
postaladdress, telephonenumber and a TTL of 1 hour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">pcacheAttrset
<b>0 mail postaladdress telephonenumber</b> <br>
pcacheTemplate <b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=)) 0 3600</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Directives for
configuring the underlying database must also be given, as
shown here:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">directory
/var/tmp/cache <br>
cachesize 100</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any valid
directives for the chosen database type may be used.
Indexing should be used as appropriate for the queries being
handled. In addition, an equality index on the
<b>pcacheQueryid</b> attribute should be configured, to
assist in the removal of expired query data.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Caching data is
prone to inconsistencies because updates on the remote
server will not be reflected in the response of the cache at
least (and at most) for the duration of the
<b>pcacheTemplate TTL</b>. These inconsistencies can be
minimized by careful use of the TTR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The remote
server should expose the <b>objectClass</b> attribute
because the underlying database that actually caches the
entries may need it for optimal local processing of the
queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The proxy
server should contain all the schema information required
for caching. Significantly, it needs the schema of
attributes used in the query templates. If the objectClass
attribute is used in a query template, it needs the
definition of the objectClasses of the entries it is
supposed to cache. It is the responsibility of the proxy
administrator to keep the proxy schema lined up with that of
the proxied server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
potential (and subtle) inconsistency may occur when data is
retrieved with different identities and specific
per-identity access control is enforced by the remote
server. If data was retrieved with an identity that
collected only partial results because of access rules
enforcement on the remote server, other users with different
access privileges on the remote server will get different
results from the remote server and from the cache. If those
users have higher access privileges on the remote server,
they will get from the cache only a subset of the results
they would get directly from the remote server; but if they
have lower access privileges, they will get from the cache a
superset of the results they would get directly from the
remote server. Either occurrence may or may not be
acceptable, based on the security policy of the cache and of
the remote server. It is important to note that in this case
the proxy is violating the security of the remote server by
disclosing to an identity data that was collected by another
identity. For this reason, it is suggested that, when using
<b>back-ldap</b>, proxy caching be used in conjunction with
the <i>identity assertion</i> feature of
<b>slapd&minus;ldap</b>(5) (see the
<b>idassert&minus;bind</b> and the
<b>idassert&minus;authz</b> statements), so that remote
server interrogation occurs with a vanilla identity that has
some relatively high <b>search</b> and <b>read</b> access
privileges, and the &quot;real&quot; access control is
delegated to the proxy&rsquo;s ACLs. Beware that since only
the cached fraction of the real datum is available to the
cache, it may not be possible to enforce the same access
rules that are defined on the remote server. When security
is a concern, cached proxy access must be carefully
tailored.</p>
