<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sensors.conf
&minus; libsensors configuration file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sensors.conf
describes how libsensors, and so all programs using it,
should translate the raw readings from the kernel modules to
real&minus;world values.</p>

<h2>SEMANTICS
<a name="SEMANTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a given
system, there may be one or more hardware monitoring chips.
Each chip may have several features. For example, the LM78
monitors 7 voltage inputs, 3 fans and one temperature.
Feature names are standardized. Typical feature names are
in0, in1, in2... for voltage inputs, fan1, fan2, fan3... for
fans and temp1, temp2, temp3... for temperature inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each feature
may in turn have one or more sub&minus;features, each
representing an attribute of the feature: input value, low
limit, high limit, alarm, etc. Sub&minus;feature names are
standardized as well. For example, the first voltage input
(in0) would typically have sub&minus;features in0_input
(measured value), in0_min (low limit), in0_max (high limit)
and in0_alarm (alarm flag). Which sub&minus;features are
actually present depend on the exact chip type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sensors.conf</i> configuration file will let you
configure each chip, feature and sub&minus;feature in a way
that makes sense for your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rest of
this section describes the meaning of each configuration
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CHIP
STATEMENT</b> <br>
A <i>chip</i> statement selects for which chips all
following <i>compute</i>, <i>label</i>, <i>ignore</i> and
<i>set</i> statements are meant. A chip selection remains
valid until the next <i>chip</i> statement. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">chip
&quot;lm78&minus;*&quot; &quot;lm79&minus;*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a chip
matches at least one of the chip descriptions, the following
configuration lines are examined for it, otherwise they are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A chip
description is built from several elements, separated by
dashes. The first element is the chip type, the second
element is the name of the bus, and the third element is the
hexadecimal address of the chip. Such chip descriptions are
printed by sensors(1) as the first line for every chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name of the
bus is either <i>isa</i>, <i>pci</i>, <i>virtual</i>,
<i>spi-*</i> or <i>i2c-N</i> with <i>N</i> being a bus
number as bound with a <i>bus</i> statement. This list
isn&rsquo;t necessarily exhaustive as support for other bus
types may be added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may
substitute the wildcard operator <i>*</i> for every element.
Note however that it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense to
specify the address without the bus type, so the address
part is plain omitted when the bus type isn&rsquo;t
specified. Here is how you would express the following
matches:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-56541.png" alt="Image grohtml-56541.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If several chip
statements match a specific chip, they are all
considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>LABEL
STATEMENT</b> <br>
A <i>label</i> statement describes how a feature should be
called. Features without a <i>label</i> statement are just
called by their feature name. Applications can use this to
label the readings they present. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">label in3
&quot;+5V&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument is the feature name. The second argument is the
feature description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
must use the raw feature name, which is not necessarily the
one displayed by &quot;sensors&quot; by default. Use
&quot;sensors &minus;u&quot; to see the raw feature names.
Same applies to all other statement types below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>IGNORE
STATEMENT</b> <br>
An <i>ignore</i> statement is a hint that a specific feature
should be ignored - probably because it returns bogus values
(for example, because a fan or temperature sensor is not
connected). Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">ignore fan1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
argument is the feature name. Please note that this does not
disable anything in the actual sensor chip; it simply hides
the feature in question from libsensors users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COMPUTE
STATEMENT</b> <br>
A <i>compute</i> statement describes how a feature&rsquo;s
raw value should be translated to a real&minus;world value,
and how a real&minus;world value should be translated back
to a raw value again. This is most useful for voltage
sensors, because in general sensor chips have a limited
range and voltages outside this range must be divided (using
resistors) before they can be monitored. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">compute in3
((6.8/10)+1)*@, @/((6.8/10)+1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The example
above expresses the fact that the voltage input is divided
using two resistors of values 6.8 Ohm and 10 Ohm,
respectively. See the <b>VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS</b>
section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument is the feature name. The second argument is an
expression which specifies how a raw value must be
translated to a real&minus;world value; &lsquo;@&rsquo;
stands here for the raw value. This is the formula which
will be applied when reading values from the chip. The third
argument is an expression that specifies how a
real&minus;world value should be translated back to a raw
value; &lsquo;@&rsquo; stands here for the real&minus;world
value. This is the formula which will be applied when
writing values to the chip. The two formulas are obviously
related, and are separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>compute</i> statement applies to all sub&minus;features
of the target feature for which it makes sense. For example,
the above example would affect sub&minus;features in3_min
and in3_max (which are voltage values) but not in3_alarm
(which is a boolean flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
operators are supported in <i>compute</i> statements:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">+ &minus; * / ( ) ^ &lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">^x means exp(x) and &lsquo;x
means ln(x).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
name of sub&minus;features in these expressions; current
readings are substituted. You should be careful though to
avoid circular references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If at any
moment a translation between a raw and a real&minus;world
value is called for, but no <i>compute</i> statement
applies, a one&minus;on&minus;one translation is used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SET
STATEMENT</b> <br>
A <i>set</i> statement is used to write a sub&minus;feature
value to the chip. Of course not all sub&minus;feature
values can be set that way, in particular input values and
alarm flags can not. Valid sub&minus;features are usually
min/max limits. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">set in3_min 5 *
0.95 <br>
set in3_max 5 * 1.05</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The example
above basically configures the chip to allow a 5% deviance
for the +5V power input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument is the feature name. The second argument is an
expression which determines the written value. If there is
an applying <i>compute</i> statement, this value is fed to
its third argument to translate it to a raw value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
name of sub&minus;features in these expressions; current
readings are substituted. You should be careful though to
avoid circular references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that <i>set</i> statements are only executed by sensors(1)
when you use the <b>&minus;s</b> option. Typical graphical
sensors applications do not care about these statements at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>BUS
STATEMENT</b> <br>
A <i>bus</i> statement binds the description of an I2C or
SMBus adapter to a bus number. This makes it possible to
refer to an adapter in the configuration file, independent
of the actual correspondence of bus numbers and actual
adapters (which may change from moment to moment).
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">bus
&quot;i2c&minus;0&quot; &quot;SMBus PIIX4 adapter at
e800&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument is the bus number. It is the literal text
<i>i2c&minus;</i>, followed by a number. As there is a dash
in this argument, it must always be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
argument is the adapter name, it must match exactly the
adapter name as it appears in
<i>/sys/class/i2c&minus;adapter/i2c&minus;*/name</i>. It
should always be quoted as well as it will most certainly
contain spaces or dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>bus</i>
statements may be scattered randomly throughout the
configuration file; there is no need to place the bus line
before the place where its binding is referred to. Still, as
a matter of good style, we suggest you place all <i>bus</i>
statements together at the top of your configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Running
<b>sensors --bus-list</b> will generate these lines for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the case
where multiple configuration files are used, the scope of
each <i>bus</i> statement is the configuration file it was
defined in. This makes it possible to have bus statements in
all configuration files which will not unexpectedly
interfere with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>STATEMENT
ORDER</b> <br>
Statements can go in any order, however it is recommended to
put &lsquo;set fanX_div&rsquo; statements before &lsquo;set
fanX_min&rsquo; statements, in case a driver doesn&rsquo;t
preserve the fanX_min setting when the fanX_div value is
changed. Even if the driver does, it&rsquo;s still better to
put the statements in this order to avoid accuracy loss.</p>

<h2>VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS
<a name="VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most voltage
sensors in sensor chips have a range of 0 to 4.08 V. This is
generally sufficient for the +3.3V and CPU supply voltages,
so the sensor chip reading is the actual voltage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other supply
voltages must be scaled with an external resistor network.
The driver reports the value at the chip&rsquo;s pin (0
&minus; 4.08 V), and the userspace application must convert
this raw value to an actual voltage. The <i>compute</i>
statements provide this facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately
the resistor values vary among motherboard types. Therefore
you have to figure out the correct resistor values for your
own motherboard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For positive
voltages (typically +5V and +12V), two resistors are used,
with the following formula: <br>
R1 = R2 * (Vs/Vin &minus; 1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where: <br>
R1 and R2 are the resistor values <br>
Vs is the actual voltage being monitored <br>
Vin is the voltage at the pin</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This leads to
the following compute formula: <br>
compute inX @*((R1/R2)+1), @/(((R1/R2)+1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Real&minus;world
formula for +5V and +12V would look like: <br>
compute in3 @*((6.8/10)+1), @/((6.8/10)+1) <br>
compute in4 @*((28/10)+1), @/((28/10)+1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For negative
voltages (typically &minus;5V and &minus;12V), two resistors
are used as well, but different boards use different
strategies to bring the voltage value into the 0 &minus;
4.08 V range. Some use an inverting amplifier, others use a
positive reference voltage. This leads to different
computation formulas. Note that most users won&rsquo;t have
to care because most modern motherboards make little use of
&minus;12V and no use of &minus;5V so they do not bother
monitoring these voltage inputs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Real&minus;world
examples for the inverting amplifier case: <br>
compute in5 &minus;@*(240/60), &minus;@/(240/60) <br>
compute in6 &minus;@*(100/60), &minus;@/(100/60)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Real&minus;world
examples for the positive voltage reference case: <br>
compute in5 @*(1+232/56) &minus; 4.096*232/56, (@ +
4.096*232/56)/(1+232/56) <br>
compute in6 @*(1+120/56) &minus; 4.096*120/56, (@ +
4.096*120/56)/(1+120/56)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many recent
monitoring chips have a 0 &minus; 2.04 V range, so scaling
resistors are even more needed, and resistor values are
different.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
a few chips out there which have internal scaling resistors,
meaning that their value is known and doesn&rsquo;t change
from one motherboard to the next. For these chips, the
driver usually handles the scaling so it is transparent to
the user and no <i>compute</i> statements are needed.</p>

<h2>TEMPERATURE CONFIGURATION
<a name="TEMPERATURE CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On top of the
usual features, temperatures can have two specific
sub&minus;features: temperature sensor type (tempX_type) and
hysteresis values (tempX_max_hyst and tempX_crit_hyst).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>THERMAL
SENSOR TYPES</b> <br>
Available thermal sensor types:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-56542.png" alt="Image grohtml-56542.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
set temp1 to thermistor type, use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">set temp1_type
4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only certain
chips support thermal sensor type change, and even these
usually only support some of the types above. Please refer
to the specific driver documentation to find out which types
are supported by your chip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In theory, the
BIOS should have configured the sensor types correctly, so
you shouldn&rsquo;t have to touch them, but sometimes it
isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>THERMAL
HYSTERESIS MECHANISM</b> <br>
Many monitoring chips do not handle the high and critical
temperature limits as simple limits. Instead, they have two
values for each limit, one which triggers an alarm when the
temperature rises and another one which clears the alarm
when the temperature falls. The latter is typically a few
degrees below the former. This mechanism is known as
hysteresis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
implementing things that way is that high temperature alarms
typically trigger an action to attempt to cool the system
down, either by scaling down the CPU frequency, or by
kicking in an extra fan. This should normally let the
temperature fall in a timely manner. If this was clearing
the alarm immediately, then the system would be back to its
original state where the temperature rises and the alarm
would immediately trigger again, causing an undesirable
tight fan on, fan off loop. The hysteresis mechanism ensures
that the system is really cool before the fan stops, so that
it will not have to kick in again immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, in addition
to tempX_max, many chips have a tempX_max_hyst sub-feature.
Likewise, tempX_crit often comes with tempX_crit_hyst.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">set temp1_max
60 <br>
set temp1_max_hyst 56</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hysteresis
mechanism can be disabled by giving both limits the same
value.</p>

<h2>BEEPS
<a name="BEEPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some chips
support alarms with beep warnings. When an alarm is
triggered you can be warned by a beeping signal through your
computer speaker. On top of per&minus;feature beep flags,
there is usually a master beep control switch to enable or
disable beeping globally. Enable beeping using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">set beep_enable
1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or disable it
using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">set beep_enable
0</p>

<h2>WHICH STATEMENT APPLIES
<a name="WHICH STATEMENT APPLIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one statement of the same kind applies at a certain moment,
the last one in the configuration file is used. So usually,
you should put more general <i>chip</i> statements at the
top, so you can overrule them below.</p>

<h2>SYNTAX
<a name="SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments are
introduced by hash marks. A comment continues to the end of
the line. Empty lines, and lines containing only whitespace
or comments are ignored. Other lines have one of the below
forms. There must be whitespace between each element, but
the amount of whitespace is unimportant. A line may be
continued on the next line by ending it with a backslash;
this does not work within a comment, <b>NAME</b> or
<b>NUMBER</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">bus <b>NAME

chip <b>NAME&minus;LIST</b> <br>
label <b>NAME NAME</b> <br>
compute <b>NAME EXPR</b> , <b>EXPR</b> <br>
ignore <b>NAME</b> <br>
set <b>NAME EXPR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>NAME</b>
is a string. If it only contains letters, digits and
underscores, it does not have to be quoted; in all other
cases, you must use double quotes around it. Within quotes,
you can use the normal escape&minus;codes from C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<b>NAME&minus;LIST</b> is one or more <b>NAME</b> items
behind each other, separated by whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>EXPR</b>
is of one of the below forms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NUMBER <br>

^ <b>EXPR</b> <br>
&lsquo; <b>EXPR</b> <br>
( <b>EXPR</b> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>NUMBER</b>
is a floating&minus;point number. &lsquo;10&rsquo;,
&lsquo;10.4&rsquo; and &lsquo;.4&rsquo; are examples of
valid floating&minus;point numbers; &lsquo;10.&rsquo; or
