<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PREPARE_TRANSACTION
&minus; prepare the current transaction for two&minus;phase
commit</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PREPARE
TRANSACTION <i>transaction_id</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>PREPARE
TRANSACTION</b></i> prepares the current transaction for
two&minus;phase commit. After this command, the transaction
is no longer associated with the current session; instead,
its state is fully stored on disk, and there is a very high
probability that it can be committed successfully, even if a
database crash occurs before the commit is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once prepared,
a transaction can later be committed or rolled back with
COMMIT PREPARED (<b>COMMIT_PREPARED</b>(7)) or ROLLBACK
PREPARED (<b>ROLLBACK_PREPARED</b>(7)), respectively. Those
commands can be issued from any session, not only the one
that executed the original transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the point
of view of the issuing session, <b>PREPARE TRANSACTION</b>
is not unlike a <b>ROLLBACK</b> command: after executing it,
there is no active current transaction, and the effects of
the prepared transaction are no longer visible. (The effects
will become visible again if the transaction is
committed.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>PREPARE TRANSACTION</b> command fails for any reason, it
becomes a <b>ROLLBACK</b>: the current transaction is
canceled.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>transaction_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An arbitrary identifier that
later identifies this transaction for <b>COMMIT PREPARED</b>
or <b>ROLLBACK PREPARED</b>. The identifier must be written
as a string literal, and must be less than 200 bytes long.
It must not be the same as the identifier used for any
currently prepared transaction.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREPARE
TRANSACTION</b> is not intended for use in applications or
interactive sessions. Its purpose is to allow an external
transaction manager to perform atomic global transactions
across multiple databases or other transactional resources.
Unless you're writing a transaction manager, you probably
shouldn't be using <b>PREPARE TRANSACTION</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
must be used inside a transaction block. Use <b>BEGIN</b>(7)
to start one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
currently allowed to <b>PREPARE</b> a transaction that has
executed any operations involving temporary tables, created
any cursors WITH HOLD, or executed <b>LISTEN</b> or
<b>UNLISTEN</b>. Those features are too tightly tied to the
current session to be useful in a transaction to be
prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
transaction modified any run&minus;time parameters with
<b>SET</b> (without the LOCAL option), those effects persist
after <b>PREPARE TRANSACTION</b>, and will not be affected
by any later <b>COMMIT PREPARED</b> or <b>ROLLBACK
PREPARED</b>. Thus, in this one respect <b>PREPARE
TRANSACTION</b> acts more like <b>COMMIT</b> than
<b>ROLLBACK</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All currently
available prepared transactions are listed in the
pg_prepared_xacts system view.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Caution</big></b>
<br>
It is unwise to leave transactions in the prepared state for
a long time. This will interfere with the ability of
<b>VACUUM</b> to reclaim storage, and in extreme cases could
cause the database to shut down to prevent transaction ID
wraparound (see Section 23.1.5, &ldquo;Preventing
Transaction ID Wraparound Failures&rdquo;, in the
documentation). Keep in mind also that the transaction
continues to hold whatever locks it held. The intended usage
of the feature is that a prepared transaction will normally
be committed or rolled back as soon as an external
transaction manager has verified that other databases are
also prepared to commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you have not
set up an external transaction manager to track prepared
transactions and ensure they get closed out promptly, it is
best to keep the prepared&minus;transaction feature disabled
by setting max_prepared_transactions to zero. This will
prevent accidental creation of prepared transactions that
might then be forgotten and eventually cause problems.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prepare the
current transaction for two&minus;phase commit, using foobar
as the transaction identifier:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">PREPARE
TRANSACTION 'foobar';</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREPARE
TRANSACTION</b> is a PostgreSQL extension. It is intended
for use by external transaction management systems, some of
which are covered by standards (such as X/Open XA), but the
SQL side of those systems is not standardized.</p>
