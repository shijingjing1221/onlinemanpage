<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pmproxy</b>
acts as a protocol proxy for <b>pmcd</b>(1), allowing
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to
one or more <b>pmcd</b>(1) instances via <b>pmproxy</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
<b>pmproxy</b> is deployed in a firewall domain, or on a
&lsquo;&lsquo;head&rsquo;&rsquo; node of a cluster where the
IP (Internet Protocol) address of the hosts where
<b>pmcd</b>(1) is running may be unknown to the PCP
monitoring clients, although the IP address of the host
where <b>pmproxy</b> is running is known to these clients.
Similarly, the clients may have network connectivity only to
the host where <b>pmproxy</b> is running, while there is
network connectivity from that host to the hosts of interest
where <b>pmcd</b>(1) is running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behaviour
of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by either the
<b>PMPROXY_HOST</b> environment variable or through the
extended hostname specification (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for
details). If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients
will make their connections directly to <b>pmcd</b>(1). If
the proxy hostname syntax is used or <b>PMPROXY_HOST</b> is
set, then this should be the hostname or IP address of the
system where <b>pmproxy</b> is running, and the clients will
connect to <b>pmcd</b>(1) indirectly through the protocol
proxy services of <b>pmproxy.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options to
<b>pmproxy</b> are as follows.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;A</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Disable service advertisement. By default,
<b>pmproxy</b> will advertise its presence on the network
using any available mechanisms (such as Avahi/DNS-SD),
assisting remote monitoring tools with finding it. These
mechanisms are disabled with this option.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b>
<i>dirname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to the Network
Security Services certificate database, for (optional)
secure connections. The default is <b>/etc/pki/nssdb</b>.
Refer also to the <b>&minus;P</b> option. If it does not
already exist, this database can be created using the
<b>certutil</b> utility. This process and other certificate
database maintenance information is provided in the
<b>PCPIntro</b>(1) manual page and the online PCP
tutorials.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;f</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>By default <b>pmproxy</b> is started as a daemon. The
<b>&minus;f</b> option indicates that it should run in the
foreground. This is most useful when trying to diagnose
problems with establishing connections.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i</b>
<i>ipaddress</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is usually only
used on hosts with more than one network interface (very
common for firewall and &lsquo;&lsquo;head&rsquo;&rsquo;
node hosts where <b>pmproxy</b> is most likely to be
deployed). If no <b>&minus;i</b> options are specified
<b>pmproxy</b> accepts PCP client connections on any of its
host&rsquo;s IP addresses. The <b>&minus;i</b> option is
used to specify explicitly an IP address that PCP client
connections should be accepted on. <i>ipaddress</i> should
be in the standard dotted form (e.g. 100.23.45.6). The
<b>&minus;i</b> option may be used multiple times to define
a list of IP addresses. When one or more <b>&minus;i</b>
options is specified, attempted connections made on any
other IP addresses will be refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b>
<i>logfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default a log file named
<i>pmproxy.log</i> is written in the current directory. The
<b>&minus;l</b> option causes the log file to be written to
<i>logfile</i> instead of the default. If the log file
cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b>
<i>bytes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>PDU</i>s received by
<b>pmproxy</b> from PCP monitoring clients are restricted to
a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to defend against
Denial of Service attacks. The <b>&minus;L</b> option may be
used to change the maximum incoming <i>PDU</i> size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;P</b>
<i>passfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the path to a file
containing the Network Security Services certificate
database password for (optional) secure connections, and for
databases that are password protected. Refer also to the
<b>&minus;C</b> option. When using this option, great care
should be exercised to ensure appropriate ownership
(&quot;pcp&quot; user, typically) and permissions on this
file (0400, so as to be unreadable by any user other than
the user running the <b>pmproxy</b> process).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;U</b>
<i>username</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Assume the identity of
<i>username</i> before starting to accept incoming packets
from PCP monitoring clients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Before the <b>pmproxy</b>
<i>logfile</i> can be opened, <b>pmproxy</b> may encounter a
fatal error which prevents it from starting. By default, the
output describing this error is sent to <b>/dev/tty</b> but
it may redirected to <i>file</i>.</p>

<h2>STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY
<a name="STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
<b>pmproxy</b> is started automatically at boot time and
stopped when the system is being brought down. Under certain
circumstances it is necessary to start or stop
<b>pmproxy</b> manually. To do this one must become
superuser and type</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#
$PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to start
<b>pmproxy</b>, or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#
$PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to stop
<b>pmproxy</b>. Starting <b>pmproxy</b> when it is already
running is the same as stopping it and then starting it
again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
<b>pmproxy</b> listens for PCP client connections on TCP/IP
port number 44322 (registered at
<i>http://www.iana.org/</i>). Either the environment
variable <b>PMPROXY_PORT &minus;p</b> command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
<b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> or the <b>&minus;p</b> command line
option may be used to specify alternative port number(s)
when <b>pmproxy</b> is started; in each case, the
specification is a comma-separated list of one or more
numerical port numbers. Should both methods be used or
multiple <b>&minus;p</b> options appear on the command line,
<b>pmproxy</b> will listen on the union of the set of ports
specified via all <b>&minus;p</b> options and the
<b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> environment variable. If non-default
ports are used with <b>pmproxy</b> care should be taken to
ensure that <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> is also set in the
environment of any client application that will connect to
<b>pmproxy</b>, or that the extended host specification
syntax is used (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for details).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the PCP environment variables described in the <b>PCP
ENVIRONMENT</b> section below, there are several environment
variables that influence the interactions between a PCP
monitoring client, <b>pmcd</b> and <b>pmcd</b>(1). <b><br>
PMCD_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For the PCP monitoring client
this (or the default port number) is passed to
<b>pmproxy</b> and used to connect to <b>pmcd</b>(1). In the
environment of <b>pmproxy PMCD_PORT is not used.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMPROXY_HOST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For the PCP monitoring client
this is the hostname or IP address of the host where
<b>pmproxy</b> is running. In recent versions of PCP (since
version 3) this has been superseded by the extended hostname
syntax (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMPROXY_PORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For the PCP monitoring client
this is the port on which <b>pmproxy</b> will accept
connections. The default is 44322.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>,
<b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> and
<b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">(see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1)) For
the PCP monitoring client, setting these environment
variables will modify the timeouts used for interactions
between the client and <b>pmproxy</b> (independent of which
<b>pmcd</b>(1) is being used). For <b>pmproxy</b> these same
environment variables control the timeouts between
<b>pmproxy</b> and all <b>pmcd</b>(1) instances (independent
of which monitoring client is involved).</p>

<h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT
<a name="PCP ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Environment
variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf</b> contains
the local values for these variables. The <b>PCP_CONF</b>
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in <b>pcp.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PCPIntro</b>(1),
<b>pmcd</b>(1), <b>pmdbg</b>(1), <b>pcp.conf</b>(5) and
<b>pcp.env</b>(5).</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>pmproxy</b> is already running the message &quot;Error:
OpenRequestSocket bind: Address already in use&quot; will
appear. This may also appear if <b>pmproxy</b> was shutdown
with an outstanding request from a client. In this case, a
request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state and
until the system closes it down (after some timeout period)
it will not be possible to run <b>pmproxy</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the standard <b>PCP</b> debugging flags, see
<b>pmdbg</b>(1), <b>pmproxy</b> currently uses
<b>DBG_TRACE_CONTEXT</b> for tracing client connections and
disconnections</p>
