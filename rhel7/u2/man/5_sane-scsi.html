&minus; SCSI adapter tips for scanners</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page contains various operating-system specific tips and
tricks on how to get scanners with a SCSI interface
working.</p>

<h2>GENERAL INFO
<a name="GENERAL INFO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For scanners
with a SCSI interface, it may be necessary to edit the
appropriate backend configuration file before using SANE for
the first time. For most systems, the configuration file
should list the name of the generic SCSI device that the
scanner is connected to (e.g., under Linux, <b>/dev/sg4</b>
or <b>/dev/sge</b> is such a generic SCSI device). It is
customary to create a symlink from <b>/dev/scanner</b> to
the generic SCSI device that the scanner is connected to. In
this case, the configuration file simply lists the line
<b>/dev/scanner</b>. For a detailed description of each
backend&rsquo;s configuration file, please refer to the
relevant backend manual page (e.g.,
<b>sane&minus;epson</b>(5) for Epson scanners,
<b>sane&minus;hp</b>(5) for HP scanners, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For some
operating systems (e.g. Linux and OS/2), there is an
alternate way of specifying scanner devices. This alternate
way allows to identify scanners by the SCSI vendor and model
string and/or by the SCSI device address (consisting of bus
number, channel number, id, and logical unit number). The
syntax for specifying a scanner in this way is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">scsi <i>VENDOR
MODEL TYPE BUS CHANNEL ID LUN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>VENDOR</i> is the SCSI vendor string, <i>MODEL</i> is the
SCSI model string, <i>TYPE</i> is type SCSI device type
string, <i>BUS</i> is the SCSI bus number (named
&quot;host&quot; in /proc/scsi/scsi), <i>CHANNEL</i> is the
SCSI channel number, <i>ID</i> is the SCSI id, and
<i>LUN</i> is the logical unit number of the scanner device.
The first two fields are strings which must be enclosed in
double-quotes if they contain any whitespace. The remaining
four fields are non-negative integer numbers. The correct
values for these fields can be found by using operating
system specific tools, e.g. for Linux by looking at the
output of the command &quot;cat /proc/scsi/scsi&quot;. To
simplify configuration, a field&rsquo;s value can be
replaced with an asterisk symbol
(&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo;). An asterisk has the effect
that any value is allowed for that particular field. This
can have the effect that a single scsi-line matches multiple
devices. When this happens, each matching device will be
probed by the backend one by one and registered if the
backend thinks it is a compatible device. For example, the
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">scsi MUSTEK
MFS&minus;06000CX Scanner 0 00 03 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would attach
the Mustek SCSI scanner with the following /proc/scsi/scsi
entry:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Host: scsi0
Channel: 00 Id: 03 Lun: 00 <br>
Vendor: MUSTEK Model: MFS&minus;06000CX Rev: 4.04 <br>
Type: Scanner ANSI SCSI revision: 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually
it&rsquo;s sufficient to use vendor and model strings only
or even only the vendor string. The following example</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">scsi MUSTEK * *
* * * *</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would have the
effect that all SCSI devices in the system with a vendor
string of MUSTEK would be probed and recognized by the
backend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
remainder of a scsi-string consists of asterisks only, the
asterisks can be omitted. For example, the following line is
equivalent to the one specified previously:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">scsi MUSTEK</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
platforms (e.g., OpenStep), SANE device names take a special
form. This is explained below in the relevant
platform-specific section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using a
SCSI scanner, ensure that the access permission for the
generic SCSI device is set appropriately. We recommend to
add a group &quot;scanner&quot; to /etc/group which contains
all users that should have access to the scanner. The
permission of the device should then be set to allow group
read and write access. For example, if the scanner is at
generic SCSI device <b>/dev/sg0</b>, then the following two
commands would set the permission correctly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">$ chgrp scanner
/dev/sg0 <br>
$ chmod 660 /dev/sg0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When your
system uses the device filesystem (devfs), you have to edit
<b>/etc/devfs/perms.</b> There you should search the
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">REGISTER
^sg[^/]* PERMISSIONS root.root 0600</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and add a new
line (eg. for changing permissions of sg4):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">REGISTER ^sg4
PERMISSIONS root.scanner 0660</p>

<h2>FREEBSD INFO
<a name="FREEBSD INFO"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Auto-configuration
using the &quot;scsi *&quot; lines in the config files only
works if the user running the frontend has read/write access
to /dev/xpt0. Instead, you can also set a link
<i>/dev/scanner</i> to the appropriate /dev/uk device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adaptec AHA1542CF</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Reported to work fine under
FreeBSD 2.2.2R with the <b>aha</b> driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adaptec 2940</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Reported to work fine under
FreeBSD 2.2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adaptec 1522</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The scanner probes ok but any
attempt to access it <i>hangs</i> the entire system. It
looks like something is disabling interrupts and then not
re-enabling them, so it looks like a bug in the FreeBSD
<b>aic</b> driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adaptec 1505</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Works on FreeBSD 2.2.5R and 3.0
using the <b>aic</b> driver, provided that Plug-and-Play
support is disabled on the card. If there are no <i>uk</i>
devices, just do a &lsquo;&lsquo;sh MAKEDEV
uk0&rsquo;&rsquo; in the <b>/dev</b> directory. The scanner
should then be accessible as <b>/dev/uk0 if it was
probed</b> during boot.</p>

<h2>LINUX INFO
<a name="LINUX INFO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, make
sure your kernel has SCSI generic support enabled. In
&lsquo;&lsquo;make xconfig&rsquo;&rsquo;, this shows up
under &lsquo;&lsquo;SCSI support-&gt;SCSI generic
support&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To keep
scanning times to a minimum, it is strongly recommended to
use a large buffer size for the generic SCSI driver. From SG
driver version 2.0 on, the maximum buffer size can be
changed at program run time, and there is no restriction in
size. This driver version is part of the Linux kernels from
version 2.2.7 on. If the new SG driver is available some
backends (e.g. sane&minus;umax, sane&minus;mustek,
sane&minus;sharp) automatically request larger scsi buffers.
If a backend does not automatically request a larger scsi
buffer, set the environment variable
<b>SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE</b> to the desired buffer size in
bytes. It is not recommended to use more than 1 MB, because
for large values the probability increases that the SG
driver cannot allocate the necessary buffer(s). For ISA
cards, even 1 MB might be a too large value. For a detailed
discussion of memory issues of the SG driver, see
http://www.torque.net/sg.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For Linux
kernels before version 2.2.7 the size of the buffer is only
32KB. This works, but for many cheaper scanners this causes
scanning to be slower by about a factor of four than when
using a size of 127KB. Linux defines the size of this buffer
by macro <b>SG_BIG_BUFF</b> in header file
<i>/usr/include/scsi/sg.h</i>. Unless a system is seriously
short on memory, it is recommended to increase this value to
the maximum legal value of 128*1024-512=130560 bytes. After
changing this value, it is necessary to recompile both the
kernel (or the SCSI generic module) and the SCSI backends.
Keep in mind that this is only necessary with older Linux
kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A common issue
with SCSI scanners is what to do when you booted the system
while the scanner was turned off? In such a case, the
scanner won&rsquo;t be recognized by the kernel and SANE
won&rsquo;t be able to access it. Fortunately, Linux
provides a simple mechanism to probe a SCSI device on
demand. Suppose you have a scanner connected to SCSI bus 2
and the scanner has a SCSI id of 5. When the system is up
and running and the scanner is turned on, you can issue the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;scsi
add&minus;single&minus;device 2 0 5 0&quot; &gt;
/proc/scsi/scsi</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and the kernel
will probe and recognize your scanner (this needs to be done
as root). It&rsquo;s also possible to dynamically remove a
SCSI device by using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;remove&minus;single&minus;device&rsquo;&rsquo;
command. For details, please refer to to the
SCSI-2.4-HOWTO.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scanners are
known to work with the following SCSI adapters under Linux.
This list isn&rsquo;t complete, usually any SCSI adapter
supported by Linux should work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Acard/Advance SCSI adapters</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Some old versions of the kernel
driver (atp870u.c) cut the inquiry information. Therefore
the scanner couldn&rsquo;t be detected correctly. Use a
current kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Adaptec
AHA-1505/AHA-1542/AHA-2940</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Reported to work fine with
Linux since v2.0. If you encounter kernel freezes or other
unexpected behaviour get the latest Linux kernel (2.2.17
seems to work) or reduce SCSI buffer size to 32 kB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">ASUS SC200</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Reported to work fine with
Linux v2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">BusLogic BT958</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">To configure the BusLogic card,
you may need to follow these instructions (contributed by
Jeremy &lt;jeremy@xxedgexx.com&gt;): During boot, when your
BusLogic adapter is being initialized, press Ctrl-B to enter
your BusLogic adapter setup. Choose the address which your
BusLogic containing your scanner is located. Choose
&lsquo;&lsquo;SCSI Device Configuration&rsquo;&rsquo;.
Choose &lsquo;&lsquo;Scan SCSI Bus&rsquo;&rsquo;. Choose
whatever SCSI id that contains your scanner and then choose
&lsquo;&lsquo;View/Modify SCSI configuration&rsquo;&rsquo;.
Change &lsquo;&lsquo;Negotiation&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;async&rsquo;&rsquo; and change
&lsquo;&lsquo;Disconnect&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;. Press Esc, save, and Esc
again until you are asked to reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">NCR/Symbios 53c400/53c400a or
Domex DTC3181E/L/LE (DTCT436/436P) <br>
ISA SCSI card</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This card is supplied by Mustek
(and other vendors). It&rsquo;s supported since Linux 2.2.
The SCSI cards are supported by the module g_NCR5380.
It&rsquo;s necessary to tell the kernel the io port and type
of card. Example for a 53c400a: &lsquo;&lsquo;modprobe
g_NCR5380 ncr_addr=0x280 ncr_53c400a=1&rsquo;&rsquo;. Once
the kernel detects the card, it should work all right.
However, while it should work, do not expect good
performance out of this card---it has no interrupt line and
therefore while a scan is in progress, the system becomes
almost unusable. You may change the values of the USLEEP
macros in drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.c. Some documentation is in
this file and NCR5380.c.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">NCR/Symbios 810</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">For some scanners it may be
necessary to disable disconnect/reconnect. To achieve this
use the option ncr53c8xx=&quot;disc:n&quot;. Some people
reported that their scanner only worked with the 53c7,8xx
driver, not the ncr53c8xx. Try both if you have trouble.
<br>
For Linux kernels before 2.0.33 it may be necessary to
increase the SCSI timeout. The default timeout for the Linux
kernels before 2.0.33 is 10 seconds, which is way too low
when scanning large area. If you get messages of the form
&lsquo;&lsquo;restart (ncr dead ?)&rsquo;&rsquo; in your
/var/log/messages file or on the system console, it&rsquo;s
an indication that the timeout is too short. In this case,
find the line &lsquo;&lsquo;if
(np-&gt;latetime&gt;10)&rsquo;&rsquo; in file ncr53c8xx.c
(normally in directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi) and
change the constant 10 to, say, 60 (one minute). Then
rebuild the kernel/module and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tekram DC315</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The driver can be downloaded
from http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc395/. For some older
scanners it may be necessary to disable all the more
advanced features by using e.g. modprobe dc395x_trm
dc395x_trm=7,5,1,32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tekram DC390</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Version 1.11 of the Tekram
driver seems to work fine mostly, except that the scan does
not terminate properly (it causes a SCSI timeout after 10
minutes). The generic AM53C974 also seems to work fine and
does not suffer from the timeout problems.</p>

<h2>SOLARIS, OPENSTEP AND NEXTSTEP INFO
<a name="SOLARIS, OPENSTEP AND NEXTSTEP INFO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Solaris,
OpenStep and NeXTStep, the generic SCSI device name refers
to a SCSI bus, not to an individual device. For example,
<b>/dev/sg0</b> refers to the first SCSI bus. To tell SANE
which device to use, append the character
&rsquo;a&rsquo;+target-id to the special device name. For
example, the SCSI device connected to the first SCSI
controller and with target-id 0 would be called
<b>/dev/sg0a</b>, and the device with target-id 1 on that
same bus would be called <b>/dev/sg0b,</b> and so on.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for the generic SCSI I/O subsystem.
E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed
by the backend. A value of 255 also prints kernel messages
from the SCSI subsystem (where available). Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_SCSICMD_TIMEOUT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the timeout value for SCSI
commands in seconds. Overriding the default value of 120
seconds should only be necessary for very slow scanners.</p>
