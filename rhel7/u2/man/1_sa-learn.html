<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given a typical
selection of your incoming mail classified as spam or ham
(non-spam), this tool will feed each mail to SpamAssassin,
allowing it to &rsquo;learn&rsquo; what signs are likely to
mean spam, and which are likely to mean ham.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Simply run this
command once for each of your mail folders, and it will
&rsquo;&rsquo;learn&rsquo;&rsquo; from the mail therein.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
csh-style <i>globbing</i> in the mail folder names is
supported; in other words, listing a folder name as
<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> will scan every folder that matches.
See <tt>&quot;Mail::SpamAssassin::ArchiveIterator&quot;</tt>
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin
remembers which mail messages it has learnt already, and
will not re-learn those messages again, unless you use the
<b>&minus;&minus;forget</b> option. Messages learnt as spam
will have SpamAssassin markup removed, on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you make a
mistake and scan a mail as ham when it is spam, or vice
versa, simply rerun this command with the correct
classification, and the mistake will be corrected.
SpamAssassin will automatically &rsquo;forget&rsquo; the
previous indications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users of
<tt>&quot;spamd&quot;</tt> who wish to perform training
remotely, over a network, should investigate the
<tt>&quot;spamc &minus;L&quot;</tt> switch.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;ham</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Learn the input message(s) as
ham. If you have previously learnt any of the messages as
spam, SpamAssassin will forget them first, then re-learn
them as ham. Alternatively, if you have previously learnt
them as ham, it&rsquo;ll skip them this time around. If the
messages have already been filtered through SpamAssassin,
the learner will ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may
have made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;spam</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Learn the input message(s) as
spam. If you have previously learnt any of the messages as
ham, SpamAssassin will forget them first, then re-learn them
as spam. Alternatively, if you have previously learnt them
as spam, it&rsquo;ll skip them this time around. If the
messages have already been filtered through SpamAssassin,
the learner will ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may
have made.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;folders</b>=<i>filename</i>,
<b>&minus;f</b> <i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">sa-learn will read in the list
of folders from the specified file, one folder per line in
the file. If the folder is prefixed with
<tt>&quot;ham:type:&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;spam:type:&quot;</tt>, sa-learn will learn that
folder appropriately, otherwise the folders will be assumed
to be of the type specified by <b>&minus;&minus;ham</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;spam</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;type&quot;</tt>
above is optional, but is the same as the standard for
ArchiveIterator: mbox, mbx, dir, file, or detect (the
default if not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;mbox</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">sa-learn will read in the
file(s) containing the emails to be learned, and will
process them in mbox format (one or more emails per
file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;mbx</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">sa-learn will read in the
file(s) containing the emails to be learned, and will
process them in mbx format (one or more emails per
file).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;use&minus;ignores</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t learn the message
if a from address matches configuration file item
<tt>&quot;bayes_ignore_from&quot;</tt> or a to address
matches <tt>&quot;bayes_ignore_to&quot;</tt>. The option
might be used when learning from a large file of messages
from which the hammy spam messages or spammy ham messages
have not been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synchronize the journal and
databases. Upon successfully syncing the database with the
entries in the journal, the journal file is removed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;force&minus;expire</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Forces an expiry attempt,
regardless of whether it may be necessary or not. Note: This
doesn&rsquo;t mean any tokens will actually expire. Please
see the <small>EXPIRATION</small> section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note:
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;force&minus;expire&quot;</tt> also
causes the journal data to be synchronized into the Bayes
databases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;forget</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Forget a given message
previously learnt.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dbpath</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows a commandline override
of the <i>bayes_path</i> configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dump</b>
<i>option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Display the contents of the
Bayes database. Without an option or with the <i>all</i>
option, all magic tokens and data tokens will be displayed.
<i>magic</i> will only display magic tokens, and <i>data</i>
will only display the data tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Can also use
the <b>&minus;&minus;regexp</b> <i><small>RE</small></i>
option to specify which tokens to display based on a regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;clear</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Clear an existing Bayes
database by removing all traces of the database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>WARNING:</small>
This is destructive and should be used with care.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;backup</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Performs a dump of the Bayes
database in machine/human readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The dump will
include token and seen data. It is suitable for input back
into the &minus;&minus;restore command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;restore</b>=<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Performs a restore of the Bayes
database defined by <i>filename</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>WARNING:</small>
This is a destructive operation, previous Bayes data will be
wiped out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u</b>
<i>username</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;username</b>=<i>username</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If specified this username will
override the username taken from the runtime environment.
You can use this option to specify users in a virtual user
configuration when using <small>SQL</small> as the Bayes
backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
This option will not change to the given <i>username</i>, it
will only attempt to act on behalf of that user. Because of
this you will need to have proper permissions to be able to
change files owned by <i>username</i>. In the case of
<small>SQL</small> this generally is not a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b> <i>path</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;configpath</b>=<i>path</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;config&minus;file</b>=<i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the specified path for
locating the distributed configuration files. Ignore the
default directories (usually
<tt>&quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot;</tt> or
similar).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;siteconfigpath</b>=<i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the specified path for
locating site-specific configuration files. Ignore the
default directories (usually
<tt>&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot;</tt> or similar).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;cf=&rsquo;config
line&rsquo;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add additional lines of
configuration directly from the command-line, parsed after
the configuration files are read. Multiple
<b>&minus;&minus;cf</b> arguments can be used, and each will
be considered a separate line of configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b> <i>prefs</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;prefspath</b>=<i>prefs</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;prefs&minus;file</b>=<i>prefs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read user score preferences
from <i>prefs</i> (usually
<tt>&quot;$HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs&quot;</tt>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prints a progress bar (to
<small>STDERR</small> ) showing the current progress. In the
case where no valid terminal is found this option will
behave very much like the &minus;&minus;showdots option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b>
[<i>area,...</i>], <b>&minus;&minus;debug</b>
[<i>area,...</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Produce debugging output. If no
areas are listed, all debugging information is printed.
Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area
individually; <i>area</i> is the area of the code to
instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic output on
bayes, learn, and dns, use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        spamassassin &minus;D bayes,learn,dns</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information about which areas (also known as channels) are
available, please see the documentation at:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        C&lt;http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Higher priority
informational messages that are suitable for logging in
normal circumstances are available with an area of
&quot;info&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;sync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Skip the slow synchronization
step which normally takes place after changing database
entries. If you plan to learn from many folders in a batch,
or to learn many individual messages one-by-one, it is
faster to use this switch and run <tt>&quot;sa&minus;learn
&minus;&minus;sync&quot;</tt> once all the folders have been
scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Clarification:
The state of <i>&minus;&minus;no&minus;sync</i> overrides
the <i>bayes_learn_to_journal</i> configuration option. If
not specified, sa-learn will learn to the database directly.
If specified, sa-learn will learn to the journal file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note:
<i>&minus;&minus;sync</i> and
<i>&minus;&minus;no&minus;sync</i> can be specified on the
same commandline, which is slightly confusing. In this case,
the <i>&minus;&minus;no&minus;sync</i> option is ignored
since there is no learn operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;local</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not perform any network
accesses while learning details about the mail messages.
This will speed up the learning process, but may result in a
slightly lower accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is currently ignored, as current versions of SpamAssassin
will not perform network access while learning; but future
versions may.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;import</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you previously used
SpamAssassin&rsquo;s Bayesian learner without the
<tt>&quot;DB_File&quot;</tt> module installed, it will have
created files in other formats, such as
<tt>&quot;GDBM_File&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;SDBM_File&quot;</tt>. This switch allows you to
migrate that old data into the <tt>&quot;DB_File&quot;</tt>
format. It will overwrite any data currently in the
<tt>&quot;DB_File&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Can also be
used with the <b>&minus;&minus;dbpath</b> <i>path</i> option
to specify the location of the Bayes files to use.</p>

<h2>MIGRATION
<a name="MIGRATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are now
multiple backend storage modules available for storing
user&rsquo;s bayesian data. As such you might want to
migrate from one backend to another. Here is a simple
procedure for migrating from one backend to another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you have individual user databases you will have to perform
a similar procedure for each one of them. <br>
sa-learn &minus;&minus;sync</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This will sync any outstanding
journal entries</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sa-learn &minus;&minus;backup
&gt; backup.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This will save all your Bayes
data to a plain text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sa-learn
&minus;&minus;clear</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is optional, but good to
do to clear out the old database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Repeat!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">At this point, if you have
multiple databases, you should perform the procedure above
for each of them. (i.e. each user&rsquo;s database needs to
be backed up before continuing.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Switch backends</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Once you have backed up all
databases you can update your configuration for the new
database backend. This will involve at least the
bayes_store_module config option and may involve some
additional config options depending on what is required by
the module. (For example, you may need to configure an
<small>SQL</small> database.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sa-learn &minus;&minus;restore
backup.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Again, you need to do this for
every database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
migrating to <small>SQL</small> you can make use of the
&minus;u &lt;username&gt; option in sa-learn to populate
each user&rsquo;s database. Otherwise, you must run sa-learn
as the user who database you are restoring.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN FILTERING
<a name="INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN FILTERING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Thanks to
Michael Bell for this section!)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
lengthy description of how this works, go to
http://www.paulgraham.com/ and see &quot;A Plan for
Spam&quot;. It&rsquo;s reasonably readable, even if
statistics make me break out in hives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The short
semi-inaccurate version: Given training, a spam heuristics
engine can take the most &quot;spammy&quot; and
&quot;hammy&quot; words and apply probabilistic analysis.
Furthermore, once given a basis for the analysis, the engine
can continue to learn iteratively by applying both the
non-Bayesian and Bayesian rulesets together to create
evolving &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin
2.50 and later supports Bayesian spam analysis, in the form
of the <small>BAYES</small> rules. This is a new feature,
quite powerful, and is disabled until enough messages have
been learnt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pros of
Bayesian spam analysis: <br>
Can greatly reduce false positives and false negatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It learns from your mail, so it
is tailored to your unique e&minus;mail flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Once it starts learning, it can
continue to learn from SpamAssassin and <br>
improve over time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And the cons:
<br>
A decent number of messages are required before results are
useful for <br>
ham/spam determination. <br>
It&rsquo;s hard to explain why a message is or isn&rsquo;t
marked as spam.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">i.e.: a straightforward rule,
that matches, say, &quot; <small>VIAGRA&quot;</small> is
easy to understand. If it generates a false positive or
false negative, it is fairly easy to understand why.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With Bayesian
analysis, it&rsquo;s all probabilities &minus; &quot;because
the past says it is likely as this falls into a
probabilistic distribution common to past spam in your
systems&quot;. Tell that to your users! Tell that to the
client when he asks &quot;what can I do to change
this&quot;. (By the way, the answer in this case is
&quot;use whitelisting&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">It will take disk space and
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The databases it maintains take
quite a lot of resources to store and use.</p>

<h2>GETTING STARTED
<a name="GETTING STARTED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Still
interested? Ok, here&rsquo;s the guidelines for getting this
working.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First a
high-level overview: <br>
Build a significant sample of both ham and spam.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">I suggest several thousand of
each, placed in <small>SPAM</small> and <small>HAM</small>
directories or mailboxes. Yes, you <small>MUST</small>
hand-sort this &minus; otherwise the results won&rsquo;t be
much better than SpamAssassin on its own. Verify the
spamminess/haminess of <small>EVERY</small> message.
You&rsquo;re urged to avoid using a publicly available
corpus (sample) &minus; this must be taken from
<small>YOUR</small> mail server, if it is to be
statistically useful. Otherwise, the results may be pretty
skewed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use this tool to teach
SpamAssassin about these samples, like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%;">        sa&minus;learn &minus;&minus;spam /path/to/spam/folder
        sa&minus;learn &minus;&minus;ham /path/to/ham/folder
        ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Let
SpamAssassin proceed, learning stuff. When it finds ham and
spam it will add the &quot;interesting tokens&quot; to the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">If you need SpamAssassin to
forget about specific messages, use the <b><br>
&minus;&minus;forget</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can be applied to either
ham or spam that has run through the <b>sa-learn</b>
processes. It&rsquo;s a bit of a hammer, really, lowering
the weighting of the specific tokens in that message (only
if that message has been processed before).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Learning from single messages
uses a command like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%;">        sa&minus;learn &minus;&minus;ham &minus;&minus;no&minus;sync mailmessage</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is handy
for binding to a key in your mail user agent. It&rsquo;s
very fast, as all the time-consuming stuff is deferred until
you run with the <tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;sync&quot;</tt>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Autolearning is enabled by
default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you don&rsquo;t have a
corpus of mail saved to learn, you can let SpamAssassin
automatically learn the mail that you receive. If you are
autolearning from scratch, the amount of mail you receive
will determine how long until the BAYES_* rules are
activated.</p>

<h2>EFFECTIVE TRAINING
<a name="EFFECTIVE TRAINING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Learning
filters require training to be effective. If you don&rsquo;t
train them, they won&rsquo;t work. In addition, you need to
train them with new messages regularly to keep them
up-to-date, or their data will become stale and impact
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You need to
train with both spam <i>and</i> ham mails. One type of mail
alone will not have any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
your mail folders contain things like forwarded spam,
discussions of spam-catching rules, etc., this will cause
trouble. You should avoid scanning those messages if
possible. (An easy way to do this is to move them aside,
into a folder which is not scanned.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the messages
you are learning from have already been filtered through
SpamAssassin, the learner will compensate for this. In
effect, it learns what each message would look like if you
had run <tt>&quot;spamassassin &minus;d&quot;</tt> over it
in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another thing
to be aware of, is that typically you should aim to train
with at least 1000 messages of spam, and 1000 ham messages,
if possible. More is better, but anything over about 5000
messages does not improve accuracy significantly in our
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful that
you train from the same source -- for example, if you train
on old spam, but new ham mail, then the classifier will
think that a mail with an old date stamp is likely to be
spam.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also
worth noting that training with a very small quantity of
ham, will produce atrocious results. You should aim to train
with at least the same amount (or more if possible!) of ham
data than spam.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On an on-going
basis, it is best to keep training the filter to make sure
it has fresh data to work from. There are various ways to do
this: <br>
1. Supervised learning</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This means keeping a copy of
all or most of your mail, separated into spam and ham piles,
and periodically re-training using those. It produces the
best results, but requires more work from you, the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(An easy way to
do this, by the way, is to create a new folder for
&rsquo;deleted&rsquo; messages, and instead of deleting them
from other folders, simply move them in there instead. Then
keep all spam in a separate folder and never delete it. As
long as you remember to move misclassified mails into the
correct folder set, it is easy enough to keep up to
date.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">2. Unsupervised learning from
Bayesian classification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Another way to train is to
chain the results of the Bayesian classifier back into the
training, so it reinforces its own decisions. This is only
safe if you then retrain it based on any errors you
discover.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin
does not support this method, due to experimental results
which strongly indicate that it does not work well, and
since Bayes is only one part of the resulting score
presented to the user (while Bayes may have made the wrong
decision about a mail, it may have been overridden by
another system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">3. Unsupervised learning from
SpamAssassin rules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Also called
&rsquo;auto&minus;learning&rsquo; in SpamAssassin. Based on
statistical analysis of the SpamAssassin success rates, we
can automatically train the Bayesian database with a certain
degree of confidence that our training data is accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It should be
supplemented with some supervised training in addition, if
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
default, but can be turned off by setting the SpamAssassin
configuration parameter
<tt>&quot;bayes_auto_learn&quot;</tt> to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">4. Mistake-based training</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This means training on a small
number of mails, then only training on messages that
SpamAssassin classifies incorrectly. This works, but it
takes longer to get it right than a full training session
would.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sa-learn</b>
and the other parts of SpamAssassin&rsquo;s Bayesian
learner, use a set of persistent database files to store the
learnt tokens, as follows. <br>
bayes_toks</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The database of tokens,
containing the tokens learnt, their count of occurrences in
ham and spam, and the timestamp when the token was last seen
in a message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This database
also contains some &rsquo;magic&rsquo; tokens, as follows:
the version number of the database, the number of ham and
spam messages learnt, the number of tokens in the database,
and timestamps of: the last journal sync, the last expiry
run, the last expiry token reduction count, the last expiry
timestamp delta, the oldest token timestamp in the database,
and the newest token timestamp in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
database file, using <tt>&quot;DB_File&quot;</tt>. The
database &rsquo;version number&rsquo; is 0 for databases
from 2.5x, 1 for databases from certain 2.6x development
releases, 2 for 2.6x, and 3 for 3.0 and later releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bayes_seen</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A map of Message-Id and some
data from headers and body to what that message was learnt
as. This is used so that SpamAssassin can avoid re-learning
a message it has already seen, and so it can reverse the
training if you later decide that message was learnt
incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
database file, using <tt>&quot;DB_File&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bayes_journal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">While SpamAssassin is scanning
mails, it needs to track which tokens it uses in its
calculations. To avoid the contention of having each
SpamAssassin process attempting to gain write access to the
Bayes <small>DB,</small> the token timestamps are written to
a &rsquo;journal&rsquo; file which will later (either
automatically or via <tt>&quot;sa&minus;learn
&minus;&minus;sync&quot;</tt>) be used to synchronize the
Bayes <small>DB.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, through
the use of <tt>&quot;bayes_learn_to_journal&quot;</tt>, or
when using the
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;sync&quot;</tt> option with
sa-learn, the actual learning data will take be placed into
the journal for later synchronization. This is typically
useful for high-traffic sites to avoid the same contention
as stated above.</p>

<h2>EXPIRATION
<a name="EXPIRATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
SpamAssassin can auto-learn messages, the Bayes database
files could increase perpetually until they fill your disk.
To control this, SpamAssassin performs journal
synchronization and bayes expiration periodically when
certain criteria (listed below) are met.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin
can sync the journal and expire the <small>DB</small> tokens
either manually or opportunistically. A journal sync is due
if <i>&minus;&minus;sync</i> is passed to sa-learn (manual),
or if the following is true (opportunistic): <br>
&minus; bayes_journal_max_size does not equal 0 (means
don&rsquo;t sync) <br>
&minus; the journal file exists</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and either:
<br>
&minus; the journal file has a size greater than
bayes_journal_max_size</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or <br>
&minus; a journal sync has previously occurred, and at least
1 day has passed <br>
since that sync</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Expiry is due
if <i>&minus;&minus;force&minus;expire</i> is passed to
sa-learn (manual), or if all of the following are true
(opportunistic): <br>
&minus; the last expire was attempted at least 12hrs ago
<br>
&minus; bayes_auto_expire does not equal 0 <br>
&minus; the number of tokens in the <small>DB</small> is
&gt; 100,000 <br>
&minus; the number of tokens in the <small>DB</small> is
&gt; bayes_expiry_max_db_size <br>
&minus; there is at least a 12 hr difference between the
oldest and newest <br>
token atimes</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>EXPIRE
LOGIC</small></b> <br>
If either the manual or opportunistic method causes an
expire run to start, here is the logic that is used: <br>
&minus; figure out how many tokens to keep. take the larger
of either <br>
bayes_expiry_max_db_size * 75% or 100,000 tokens. therefore,
the goal <br>
reduction is number of tokens &minus; number of tokens to
keep. <br>
&minus; if the reduction number is &lt; 1000 tokens, abort
(not worth the <br>
effort). <br>
&minus; if an expire has been done before, guesstimate the
new atime delta <br>
based on the old atime delta. (new_atime_delta =
old_atime_delta * <br>
old_reduction_count / goal) <br>
&minus; if no expire has been done before, or the last
expire looks &quot;weird&quot;, <br>
do an estimation pass. The definition of &quot;weird&quot;
is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&minus; last expire over 30
days ago <br>
&minus; last atime delta was &lt; 12 hrs <br>
&minus; last reduction count was &lt; 1000 tokens <br>
&minus; estimated new atime delta is &lt; 12 hrs <br>
&minus; the difference between the last reduction count and
the goal <br>
reduction count is &gt; 50%</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ESTIMATION
PASS LOGIC</small></b> <br>
Go through each of the <small>DB</small> &rsquo;s tokens.
Starting at 12hrs, calculate whether or not the token would
be expired (based on the difference between the
token&rsquo;s atime and the db&rsquo;s newest token atime)
and keep the count. Work out from 12hrs exponentially by
powers of 2. ie: 12hrs * 1, 12hrs * 2, 12hrs * 4, 12hrs * 8,
and so on, up to 12hrs * 512 (6144hrs, or 256 days).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The larger the
delta, the smaller the number of tokens that will be
expired. Conversely, the number of tokens goes up as the
delta gets smaller. So starting at the largest atime delta,
figure out which delta will expire the most tokens without
going above the goal expiration count. Use this to choose
the atime delta to use, unless one of the following occurs:
<br>
&minus; the largest atime (smallest reduction count) would
expire too many <br>
tokens. this means the learned tokens are mostly old and
there needs <br>
to be new tokens learned before an expire can occur. <br>
&minus; all of the atime choices result in 0 tokens being
removed. this means <br>
the tokens are all newer than 12 hours and there needs to be
new tokens <br>
learned before an expire can occur. <br>
&minus; the number of tokens that would be removed is &lt;
1000. the benefit <br>
isn&rsquo;t worth the effort. more tokens need to be
learned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the expire
run gets past this point, it will continue to the end. A new
<small>DB</small> is created since the majority of
<small>DB</small> libraries don&rsquo;t shrink the
<small>DB</small> file when tokens are removed. So we do the
&quot;create new, migrate old to new, remove old, rename
new&quot; shuffle.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>EXPIRY
RELATED CONFIGURATION SETTINGS</small></b> <br>
&quot;bayes_auto_expire&quot; is used to specify whether or
not SpamAssassin <br>
ought to opportunistically attempt to expire the Bayes
database. The <br>
default is 1 (yes). <br>
&quot;bayes_expiry_max_db_size&quot; specifies both the
auto-expire token count <br>
point, as well as the resulting number of tokens after
expiry as <br>
described above. The default value is 150,000, which is
roughly <br>
equivalent to a 6Mb database file if you&rsquo;re using
DB_File. <br>
&quot;bayes_journal_max_size&quot; specifies how large the
Bayes journal will <br>
grow before it is opportunistically synced. The default
value is <br>
102400.</p>
