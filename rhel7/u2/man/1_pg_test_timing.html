<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_test_timing
is a tool to measure the timing overhead on your system and
confirm that the system time never moves backwards. Systems
that are slow to collect timing data can give less accurate
<b>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</b> results.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_test_timing
accepts the following command&minus;line options:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;d</b>
<i>duration</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;duration=</b><i>duration</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the test duration, in
seconds. Longer durations give slightly better accuracy, and
are more likely to discover problems with the system clock
moving backwards. The default test duration is 3
seconds.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Interpreting
results</b> <br>
Good results will show most (&gt;90%) individual timing
calls take less than one microsecond. Average per loop
overhead will be even lower, below 100 nanoseconds. This
example from an Intel i7&minus;860 system using a TSC clock
source shows excellent performance:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Testing timing
overhead for 3 seconds. <br>
Per loop time including overhead: 35.96 nsec <br>
Histogram of timing durations: <br>
&lt; usec: count percent <br>
16: 2 0.00000% <br>
8: 13 0.00002% <br>
4: 126 0.00015% <br>
2: 2999652 3.59518% <br>
1: 80435604 96.40465%</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
different units are used for the per loop time than the
histogram. The loop can have resolution within a few
nanoseconds (nsec), while the individual timing calls can
only resolve down to one microsecond (usec).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Measuring
executor timing overhead</b> <br>
When the query executor is running a statement using
<b>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</b>, individual operations are timed as
well as showing a summary. The overhead of your system can
be checked by counting rows with the psql program:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TABLE t
AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,100000); <br>
\timing <br>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t; <br>
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
i7&minus;860 system measured runs the count query in 9.8 ms
while the <b>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</b> version takes 16.6 ms, each
processing just over 100,000 rows. That 6.8 ms difference
means the timing overhead per row is 68 ns, about twice what
pg_test_timing estimated it would be. Even that relatively
small amount of overhead is making the fully timed count
statement take almost 70% longer. On more substantial
queries, the timing overhead would be less problematic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Changing
time sources</b> <br>
On some newer Linux systems, it's possible to change the
clock source used to collect timing data at any time. A
second example shows the slowdown possible from switching to
the slower acpi_pm time source, on the same system used for
the fast results above:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># cat
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
<br>
tsc hpet acpi_pm <br>
# echo acpi_pm &gt;
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
<br>
# pg_test_timing <br>
Per loop time including overhead: 722.92 nsec <br>
Histogram of timing durations: <br>
&lt; usec: count percent <br>
16: 3 0.00007% <br>
8: 563 0.01357% <br>
4: 3241 0.07810% <br>
2: 2990371 72.05956% <br>
1: 1155682 27.84870%</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
configuration, the sample <b>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</b> above takes
115.9 ms. That's 1061 nsec of timing overhead, again a small
multiple of what's measured directly by this utility. That
much timing overhead means the actual query itself is only
taking a tiny fraction of the accounted for time, most of it
is being consumed in overhead instead. In this
configuration, any <b>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</b> totals involving
many timed operations would be inflated significantly by
timing overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD also
allows changing the time source on the fly, and it logs
information about the timer selected during boot:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">dmesg | grep
&quot;Timecounter&quot; <br>
sysctl kern.timecounter.hardware=TSC</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other systems
may only allow setting the time source on boot. On older
Linux systems the &quot;clock&quot; kernel setting is the
only way to make this sort of change. And even on some more
recent ones, the only option you'll see for a clock source
is &quot;jiffies&quot;. Jiffies are the older Linux software
clock implementation, which can have good resolution when
it's backed by fast enough timing hardware, as in this
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ cat
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
<br>
jiffies <br>
$ dmesg | grep time.c <br>

$ pg_test_timing <br>

16: 1 0.00000% <br>
8: 22 0.00007% <br>
4: 3010 0.00981% <br>
2: 2993204 9.75277% <br>
1: 27694571 90.23734%</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Clock
hardware and timing accuracy</b> <br>
Collecting accurate timing information is normally done on
computers using hardware clocks with various levels of
accuracy. With some hardware the operating systems can pass
the system clock time almost directly to programs. A system
clock can also be derived from a chip that simply provides
timing interrupts, periodic ticks at some known time
interval. In either case, operating system kernels provide a
clock source that hides these details. But the accuracy of
that clock source and how quickly it can return results
varies based on the underlying hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inaccurate time
keeping can result in system instability. Test any change to
the clock source very carefully. Operating system defaults
are sometimes made to favor reliability over best accuracy.
And if you are using a virtual machine, look into the
recommended time sources compatible with it. Virtual
hardware faces additional difficulties when emulating
timers, and there are often per operating system settings
suggested by vendors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Time Stamp
Counter (TSC) clock source is the most accurate one
available on current generation CPUs. It's the preferred way
to track the system time when it's supported by the
operating system and the TSC clock is reliable. There are
several ways that TSC can fail to provide an accurate timing
source, making it unreliable. Older systems can have a TSC
clock that varies based on the CPU temperature, making it
unusable for timing. Trying to use TSC on some older
multicore CPUs can give a reported time that's inconsistent
among multiple cores. This can result in the time going
backwards, a problem this program checks for. And even the
newest systems can fail to provide accurate TSC timing with
very aggressive power saving configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Newer operating
systems may check for the known TSC problems and switch to a
slower, more stable clock source when they are seen. If your
system supports TSC time but doesn't default to that, it may
be disabled for a good reason. And some operating systems
may not detect all the possible problems correctly, or will
allow using TSC even in situations where it's known to be
inaccurate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The High
Precision Event Timer (HPET) is the preferred timer on
systems where it's available and TSC is not accurate. The
timer chip itself is programmable to allow up to 100
nanosecond resolution, but you may not see that much
accuracy in your system clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) provides a Power
Management (PM) Timer, which Linux refers to as the acpi_pm.
The clock derived from acpi_pm will at best provide 300
nanosecond resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Timers used on
older PC hardware including the 8254 Programmable Interval
Timer (PIT), the real&minus;time clock (RTC), the Advanced
Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) timer, and the
Cyclone timer. These timers aim for millisecond
resolution.</p>
