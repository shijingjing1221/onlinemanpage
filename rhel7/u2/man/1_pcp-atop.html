<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
<b>pcp-atop</b> is an interactive monitor to view various
aspects of load on a system. It shows the occupation of the
most critical hardware resources (from a performance point
of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk and
network. <br>
It also shows which processes are responsible for the
indicated load with respect to cpu and memory load on
process level. Disk load is shown per process if
&quot;storage accounting&quot; is active in the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every
<i>interval</i> (default: 10 seconds) information is shown
about the resource occupation on system level (cpu, memory,
disks and network layers), followed by a list of processes
which have been active during the last interval (note that
all processes that were unchanged during the last interval
are not shown, unless the key &rsquo;a&rsquo; has been
pressed). If the list of active processes does not entirely
fit on the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted
in order of activity). <br>
The intervals are repeated till the number of <i>samples</i>
(specified as command argument) is reached, or till the key
&rsquo;q&rsquo; is pressed in interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When invoked
via the <b>pcp</b>(1) command, the
<b>&minus;h</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;host</b>,
<b>&minus;a</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;archive</b>,
<b>&minus;O</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;origin</b>,
<b>&minus;s</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;samples</b>,
<b>&minus;t</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;interval</b>,
<b>&minus;Z</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;timezone</b> and several
other options become indirectly available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>pcp-atop</b> is started, it checks whether the standard
output channel is connected to a screen, or to a file/pipe.
In the first case it produces screen control codes (via the
ncurses library) and behaves interactively; in the second
case it produces flat ASCII-output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In interactive
mode, the output of <b>pcp-atop</b> scales dynamically to
the current dimensions of the screen/window. <br>
If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added
or removed automatically. For this purpose, every column has
a particular weight. The columns with the highest weights
that fit within the current width will be shown. <br>
If the window is resized vertically, lines of the
process/thread list will be added or removed
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore in
interactive mode the output of <b>pcp-atop</b> can be
controlled by pressing particular keys. However it is also
possible to specify such key as <b>flag</b> on the command
line. In that case <b>pcp-atop</b> switches to the indicated
mode on beforehand; this mode can be modified again
interactively. Specifying such key as flag is especially
useful when running <b>pcp-atop</b> with output to a pipe or
file (non-interactively). These flags are the same as the
keys that can be pressed in interactive mode (see section
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS). <br>
Additional flags are available to support storage of
<b>pcp-atop</b> data in PCP archive format (see section PCP
DATA STORAGE).</p>

<h2>COLORS
<a name="COLORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
resource consumption on system level, <b>pcp-atop</b> uses
colors to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has
been (almost) reached. A critical occupation percentage
means that is likely that this load causes a noticeable
negative performance influence for applications using this
resource. The critical percentage depends on the type of
resource: e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a
busy percentage of 80% might be more noticeable for
applications/user than a CPU with a busy percentage of 90%.
<br>
Currently <b>pcp-atop</b> uses the following default values
to calculate a weighted percentage per resource: &nbsp;
<b><br>
Processor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A busy percentage of 90% or
higher is considered &lsquo;critical&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Disk</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A busy percentage of 70% or
higher is considered &lsquo;critical&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Network</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A busy percentage of 90% or
higher for the load of an interface is considered
&lsquo;critical&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Memory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">An occupation percentage of 90%
is considered &lsquo;critical&rsquo;. Notice that this
occupation percentage is the accumulated memory consumption
of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the memory
for the page cache (&lsquo;cache&rsquo; and
&lsquo;buff&rsquo; in the MEM-line) and the reclaimable part
of the slab (&lsquo;slrec&lsquo;) is not implied! <br>
If the number of pages swapped out (&lsquo;swout&rsquo; in
the PAG-line) is larger than 10 per second, the memory
resource is considered &lsquo;critical&rsquo;. A value of at
least 1 per second is considered &lsquo;almost
critical&rsquo;. <br>
If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit
(&lsquo;vmcom&rsquo; and &lsquo;vmlim&rsquo; in the
SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the
system. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Swap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">An occupation percentage of 80%
is considered &lsquo;critical&rsquo; because swap space
might be completely exhausted in the near future; it is not
critical from a performance point-of-view.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These default
values can be modified in the configuration file (see
separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a resource
exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning
values in the screen line are colored red by default. <br>
When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical
percentage (so it is almost critical), the concerning values
in the screen line are colored cyan by default. This
&lsquo;almost critical percentage&rsquo; (one value for all
resources) can be modified in the configuration file (see
separate man-page of pcp-atoprc). <br>
The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the
configuration file as well (see separate man-page of
pcp-atoprc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the key
&rsquo;x&rsquo; (or flag &minus;x), the use of colors can be
suppressed.</p>

<h2>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
<a name="INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When running
<b>pcp-atop</b> interactively (no output redirection), keys
can be pressed to control the output. In general, lower case
keys can be used to show other information for the active
processes and upper case keys can be used to influence the
sort order of the active process/thread list.</p>

<h2>PCP DATA STORAGE
<a name="PCP DATA STORAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
store system and process level statistics for long-term
analysis (e.g. to check the system load and the active
processes running yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00 PM),
<b>pcp-atop</b> can store the system and process level
statistics in the PCP archive format, as an archive folio
(see <b>mkaf</b>(1)). <br>
By default only processes which have been active during the
interval are stored in the raw file. When the flag <b>-a</b>
is specified, all processes will be stored. <br>
The interval (default: 10 seconds) and number of samples
(default: infinite) can be passed as last arguments. Instead
of the number of samples, the flag <b>-S</b> can be used to
indicate that <b>pcp-atop</b> should finish anyhow before
midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A PCP archive
folio can be read and visualized again with the flag
<b>-r</b> followed by the filename. <br>
The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by
using the key &rsquo;t&rsquo; to show the next sample, the
key &rsquo;T&rsquo; to show the previous sample, the key
&rsquo;b&rsquo; to branch to a particular time or the key
&rsquo;r&rsquo; to rewind to the begin of the file. <br>
When output is redirected to a file or pipe, <b>pcp-atop</b>
prints all samples in plain ASCII. The default line length
is 80 characters in that case; with the flag <b>-L</b>
followed by an alternate line length, more (or less) columns
will be shown. <br>
With the flag <b>-b</b> (begin time) and/or <b>-e</b> (end
time) followed by a time argument of the form HH:MM, a
certain time period within the raw file can be selected.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
<a name="OUTPUT DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
sample shows the system level activity since boot (the
elapsed time in the header shows the time since boot). Note
that particular counters could have reached their maximum
value (several times) and started by zero again, so do not
rely on these figures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For every
sample <b>pcp-atop</b> first shows the lines related to
system level activity. If a particular system resource has
not been used during the interval, the entire line related
to this resource is suppressed. So the number of system
level lines may vary for each sample. <br>
After that a list is shown of processes which have been
active during the last interval. This list is by default
sorted on cpu consumption, but this order can be changed by
the keys which are previously described.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If values have
to be shown by <b>pcp-atop</b> which do not fit in the
column width, another format is used. If e.g. a
cpu-consumption of 233216 milliseconds should be shown in a
column width of 4 positions, it is shown as
&lsquo;233s&rsquo; (in seconds). For large memory figures,
another unit is chosen if the value does not fit (Mb instead
of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, ...). For other
values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789
shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).</p>

active network interface one line is shown, sorted on the
interface activity. Such line shows the name of the
interface and its busy percentage in the first column. The
busy percentage for half duplex is determined by comparing
the interface speed with the number of bits transmitted and
received per second; for full duplex the interface speed is
compared with the highest of either the transmitted or the
received bits. When the interface speed can not be
determined (e.g. for the loopback interface),
&lsquo;---&rsquo; is shown instead of the percentage. <br>

<p style="margin-left:25%;">Every process shares resident
memory with other processes. E.g. when a particular program
is started several times, the code pages (text) are only
loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations. Also
the code of shared libraries is shared by all processes
using that shared library, as well as shared memory and
memory-mapped files. For the PSIZE calculation of a process,
the resident memory of a process that is shared with other
processes is divided by the number of sharers. This means,
that every process is accounted for a proportional part of
that memory. Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes
in the system gives a reliable impression of the total
resident memory consumed by all processes. <br>
Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate
the PSIZE is a relatively time-consuming task, the
&rsquo;R&rsquo; key (or &rsquo;&minus;R&rsquo; flag) should
be active. Gathering these values also requires superuser
privileges (otherwise &rsquo;?K&rsquo; is shown in the
