<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VACUUM &minus;
garbage&minus;collect and optionally analyze a database</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VACUUM [ ( {
FULL | FREEZE | VERBOSE | ANALYZE } [, ...] ) ] [
<i>table_name</i> [ (<i>column_name</i> [, ...] ) ] ] <br>

<br>
VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] ANALYZE [

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VACUUM</b>
reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. In normal
PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted
by an update are not physically removed from their table;
they remain present until a <b>VACUUM</b> is done. Therefore
it's necessary to do <b>VACUUM</b> periodically, especially
on frequently&minus;updated tables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With no
parameter, <b>VACUUM</b> processes every table in the
current database that the current user has permission to
vacuum. With a parameter, <b>VACUUM</b> processes only that
table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VACUUM
ANALYZE</b> performs a <b>VACUUM</b> and then an
<b>ANALYZE</b> for each selected table. This is a handy
combination form for routine maintenance scripts. See
<b>ANALYZE</b>(7) for more details about its processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Plain
<b>VACUUM</b> (without FULL) simply reclaims space and makes
it available for re&minus;use. This form of the command can
operate in parallel with normal reading and writing of the
table, as an exclusive lock is not obtained. However, extra
space is not returned to the operating system (in most
cases); it's just kept available for re&minus;use within the
same table. <b>VACUUM FULL</b> rewrites the entire contents
of the table into a new disk file with no extra space,
allowing unused space to be returned to the operating
system. This form is much slower and requires an exclusive
lock on each table while it is being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the option
list is surrounded by parentheses, the options can be
written in any order. Without parentheses, options must be
specified in exactly the order shown above. The
parenthesized syntax was added in PostgreSQL 9.0; the
unparenthesized syntax is deprecated.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FULL</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Selects &ldquo;full&rdquo;
vacuum, which can reclaim more space, but takes much longer
and exclusively locks the table. This method also requires
extra disk space, since it writes a new copy of the table
and doesn't release the old copy until the operation is
complete. Usually this should only be used when a
significant amount of space needs to be reclaimed from
within the table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FREEZE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Selects aggressive
&ldquo;freezing&rdquo; of tuples. Specifying FREEZE is
equivalent to performing <b>VACUUM</b> with the
vacuum_freeze_min_age parameter set to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VERBOSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prints a detailed vacuum
activity report for each table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ANALYZE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Updates statistics used by the
planner to determine the most efficient way to execute a
query.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of a specific table to vacuum.
Defaults to all tables in the current database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>column_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of a specific column
to analyze. Defaults to all columns. If a column list is
specified, ANALYZE is implied.</p>

<h2>OUTPUTS
<a name="OUTPUTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When VERBOSE is
specified, <b>VACUUM</b> emits progress messages to indicate
which table is currently being processed. Various statistics
about the tables are printed as well.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To vacuum a
table, one must ordinarily be the table's owner or a
superuser. However, database owners are allowed to vacuum
all tables in their databases, except shared catalogs. (The
restriction for shared catalogs means that a true
database&minus;wide <b>VACUUM</b> can only be performed by a
superuser.) <b>VACUUM</b> will skip over any tables that the
calling user does not have permission to vacuum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VACUUM</b>
cannot be executed inside a transaction block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For tables with
GIN indexes, <b>VACUUM</b> (in any form) also completes any
pending index insertions, by moving pending index entries to
the appropriate places in the main GIN index structure. See
Section 55.3.1, &ldquo;GIN Fast Update Technique&rdquo;, in
the documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recommend
that active production databases be vacuumed frequently (at
least nightly), in order to remove dead rows. After adding
or deleting a large number of rows, it might be a good idea
to issue a <b>VACUUM ANALYZE</b> command for the affected
table. This will update the system catalogs with the results
of all recent changes, and allow the PostgreSQL query
planner to make better choices in planning queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>FULL</b>
option is not recommended for routine use, but might be
useful in special cases. An example is when you have deleted
or updated most of the rows in a table and would like the
table to physically shrink to occupy less disk space and
allow faster table scans. <b>VACUUM FULL</b> will usually
shrink the table more than a plain <b>VACUUM</b> would.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VACUUM</b>
causes a substantial increase in I/O traffic, which might
cause poor performance for other active sessions. Therefore,
it is sometimes advisable to use the cost&minus;based vacuum
delay feature. See Section 18.4.4, &ldquo;Cost-based Vacuum
Delay&rdquo;, in the documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PostgreSQL
includes an &ldquo;autovacuum&rdquo; facility which can
automate routine vacuum maintenance. For more information
about automatic and manual vacuuming, see Section 23.1,
&ldquo;Routine Vacuuming&rdquo;, in the documentation.</p>
