&minus; Restore an IPA master</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ipa&minus;restore
[<i>OPTION</i>]... BACKUP</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only the name
of the backup needs to be passed in, not the full path.
Backups are stored in a subdirectory in /var/lib/ipa/backup.
If a backup is in another location then the full path must
be provided. <br>
The naming convention for full backups is
ipa&minus;full&minus;YEAR&minus;MM&minus;DD&minus;HH&minus;MM&minus;SS
<br>
in the GMT time zone. <br>
The naming convention for data backups is
ipa&minus;data&minus;YEAR&minus;MM&minus;DD&minus;HH&minus;MM&minus;SS
<br>
In the GMT time zone. <br>
The type of backup is automatically detected. A data restore
can be <br>
done from either type. <b><br>
WARNING</b>: A full restore will restore files like
/etc/passwd, <br>
/etc/group, /etc/resolv.conf as well. Any file that IPA may
have <br>
touched is backed up and restored. <br>
An encrypted backup is also automatically detected and the
root keyring <br>
is used by default. The &minus;&minus;keyring option can be
used to define the full <br>
path to the private and public keys. <br>
Within the subdirectory is file, header, that describes the
back up <br>
including the type, system, date of backup, the version of
IPA, the <br>
version of the backup and the services on the master. <br>
A backup can not be restored on another host. <br>
A backup can not be restored in a different version of IPA.
<br>
Restoring from backup sets the server as the new data
master. All other <br>
masters will need to be re&minus;initialized. The first step
in restoring a <br>
backup is to disable replication on all the other masters.
This is to <br>
prevent the changelog from overwriting the data in the
backup. <br>
Use the ipa&minus;replica&minus;manage and
ipa&minus;csreplica&minus;manage commands to <br>
re&minus;initialize other masters.
ipa&minus;csreplica&minus;manage only needs to be <br>
executed on masters that have a CA installed.</p>

<h2>REPLICATION
<a name="REPLICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The restoration
on other masters needs to be done carefully, to match the
replication topology, working outward from the restored
master. For example, if your topology is A &lt;&minus;&gt; B
&lt;&minus;&gt; C and you restored master A you would
restore B first, then C. <br>
Replication is disabled on all masters that are available
when a <br>
restoration is done. If a master is down at the time of the
restoration <br>
you will need to proceed with extreme caution. If this
master is <br>
brought back up after the restoration is complete it may
send out <br>
replication updates that apply the very changes you were
trying to back <br>
out. The only safe answer is to reinstall the master. This
would <br>
involve deleting all replication agreements to the master.
This could <br>
have a cascading effect if the master is a hub to other
masters. They <br>
would need to be connected to other masters before removing
the downed <br>
master. <br>
If the restore point is from a period prior to a replication
agreement <br>
then the master will need to be re&minus;installed. For
example, you have <br>
masters A and B and you create a backup. You then add master
C from B. <br>
Then you restore from the backup. The restored data is going
to lose <br>
the replication agreement to C. The master on C will have a
replication <br>
agreement pointing to B, but B won&rsquo;t have the reverse
agreement. Master <br>
C won&rsquo;t be registered as an IPA master. It may be
possible to manually <br>
correct these and re&minus;connect C to B but it would be
very prone to <br>
error. <br>
If re&minus;initializing on an IPA master version prior to
3.2 then the <br>
replication agreements will need to be manually
re&minus;enabled otherwise <br>
the re&minus;initialization will never complete. To manually
enable an <br>
agreement use ldapsearch to find the agreement name in
cn=mapping <br>
tree,cn=config. The value of nsds5ReplicaEnabled needs to be
on, and <br>
enabled on both sides. Remember that CA replication is done
through a <br>
separate agreement and will need to be updated separately.
<br>
If you have older masters you should consider
re&minus;creating them rather <br>
than trying to re&minus;initialize them.</p>
