<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mdmon</b>
<i>[--all] [--takeover] [--foreground] CONTAINER</i></p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The 2.6.27
kernel brings the ability to support external metadata
arrays. External metadata implies that user space handles
all updates to the metadata. The kernel&rsquo;s
responsibility is to notify user space when a &quot;metadata
event&quot; occurs, like disk failures and clean-to-dirty
transitions. The kernel, in important cases, waits for user
space to take action on these notifications.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Metadata
updates:</b> <br>
To service metadata update requests a daemon, <i>mdmon</i>,
is introduced. <i>Mdmon</i> is tasked with polling the sysfs
namespace looking for changes in <b>array_state</b>,
<b>sync_action</b>, and per disk <b>state</b> attributes.
When a change is detected it calls a per metadata type
handler to make modifications to the metadata. The following
actions are taken:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>array_state &minus;
inactive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Clear the dirty bit for the
volume and let the array be stopped</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>array_state &minus; write
pending</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Set the dirty bit for the array
and then set <b>array_state</b> to <b>active</b>. Writes are
blocked until userspace writes <b>active.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>array_state &minus;
active-idle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The safe mode timer has expired
so set array state to clean to block writes to the array</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>array_state &minus;
clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Clear the dirty bit for the
volume</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>array_state &minus;
read-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is the initial state that
all arrays start at. <i>mdmon</i> takes one of the three
actions:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1/</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Transition the array to read-auto keeping the dirty bit
clear if the metadata handler determines that the array does
not need resyncing or other modification</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2/</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Transition the array to active if the metadata handler
determines a resync or some other manipulation is
necessary</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3/</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Leave the array read&minus;only if the volume is marked
to not be monitored; for example, the metadata version has
been set to &quot;external:&minus;dev/md127&quot; instead of
&quot;external:/dev/md127&quot;</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>sync_action &minus;
resync&minus;to&minus;idle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Notify the metadata handler
that a resync may have completed. If a resync process is
idled before it completes this event allows the metadata
handler to checkpoint resync.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>sync_action &minus;
recover&minus;to&minus;idle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">A spare may have completed
rebuilding so tell the metadata handler about the state of
each disk. This is the metadata handler&rsquo;s opportunity
to clear any &quot;out-of-sync&quot; bits and clear the
volume&rsquo;s degraded status. If a recovery process is
idled before it completes this event allows the metadata
handler to checkpoint recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&lt;disk&gt;/state &minus;
faulty</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">A disk failure kicks off a
series of events. First, notify the metadata handler that a
disk has failed, and then notify the kernel that it can
unblock writes that were dependent on this disk. After
unblocking the kernel this disk is set to be removed+ from
the member array. Finally the disk is marked failed in all
other member arrays in the container.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">+ Note This
behavior differs slightly from native MD arrays where
removal is reserved for a <b>mdadm --remove</b> event. In
the external metadata case the container holds the final
reference on a block device and a <b>mdadm --remove
&lt;container&gt; &lt;victim&gt;</b> call is still
required.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Containers:</b>
<br>
External metadata formats, like DDF, differ from the native
MD metadata formats in that they define a set of disks and a
series of sub-arrays within those disks. MD metadata in
comparison defines a 1:1 relationship between a set of block
devices and a RAID array. For example to create 2 arrays at
different RAID levels on a single set of disks, MD metadata
requires the disks be partitioned and then each array can be
created with a subset of those partitions. The supported
external formats perform this disk carving internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Container
devices simply hold references to all member disks and allow
tools like <i>mdmon</i> to determine which active arrays
belong to which container. Some array management commands
like disk removal and disk add are now only valid at the
container level. Attempts to perform these actions on member
arrays are blocked with error messages like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;mdadm:
Cannot remove disks from a &acute;member&acute; array,
perform this operation on the parent container&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Containers are
identified in /proc/mdstat with a metadata version string
&quot;external:&lt;metadata name&gt;&quot;. Member devices
are identified by &quot;external:/&lt;container
device&gt;/&lt;member index&gt;&quot;, or
&quot;external:-&lt;container device&gt;/&lt;member
index&gt;&quot; if the array is to remain readonly.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CONTAINER</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>container</b> device to
monitor. It can be a full path like /dev/md/container, or a
simple md device name like md127.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;foreground</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Normally, <i>mdmon</i> will
fork and continue in the background. Adding this option will
skip that step and run <i>mdmon</i> in the foreground.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;takeover</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This instructs <i>mdmon</i> to
replace any active <i>mdmon</i> which is currently
monitoring the array. This is primarily used late in the
boot process to replace any <i>mdmon</i> which was started
from an <b>initramfs</b> before the root filesystem was
mounted. This avoids holding a reference on that
<b>initramfs</b> indefinitely and ensures that the
<i>pid</i> and <i>sock</i> files used to communicate with
<i>mdmon</i> are in a standard place.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>&minus;&minus;all</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This tells mdmon to find any active containers and start
monitoring each of them if appropriate. This is normally
used with <b>&minus;&minus;takeover</b> late in the boot
sequence. A separate <i>mdmon</i> process is started for
each container as the <b>&minus;&minus;all</b> argument is
over-written with the name of the container. To allow for
containers with names longer than 5 characters, this
argument can be arbitrarily extended, e.g. to
<b>&minus;&minus;all-active-arrays</b>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<i><br>
mdmon</i> is automatically started by <i>mdadm</i> when
needed and so does not need to be considered when working
with RAID arrays. The only times it is run other than by
<i>mdadm</i> is when the boot scripts need to restart it
after mounting the new root filesystem.</p>

<h2>START UP AND SHUTDOWN
<a name="START UP AND SHUTDOWN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As <i>mdmon</i>
needs to be running whenever any filesystem on the monitored
device is mounted there are special considerations when the
root filesystem is mounted from an <i>mdmon</i> monitored
device. Note that in general <i>mdmon</i> is needed even if
the filesystem is mounted read-only as some filesystems can
still write to the device in those circumstances, for
example to replay a journal after an unclean shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the array
is assembled by the <b>initramfs</b> code, mdadm will
automatically start <i>mdmon</i> as required. This means
that <i>mdmon</i> must be installed on the <b>initramfs</b>
and there must be a writable filesystem (typically tmpfs) in
which <b>mdmon</b> can create a <b>.pid</b> and <b>.sock</b>
file. The particular filesystem to use is given to mdmon at
compile time and defaults to <b>/run/mdadm</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This filesystem
must persist through to shutdown time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the final
root filesystem has be instantiated (usually with
<b>pivot_root</b>) <i>mdmon</i> should be run with
<i>&minus;&minus;all &minus;&minus;takeover</i> so that the
<i>mdmon</i> running from the <b>initramfs</b> can be
replaced with one running in the main root, and so the
memory used by the initramfs can be released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At shutdown
time, <i>mdmon</i> should not be killed along with other
processes. Also as it holds a file (socket actually) open in
<b>/dev</b> (by default) it will not be possible to unmount
<b>/dev</b> if it is a separate filesystem.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mdmon
&minus;&minus;all-active-arrays &minus;&minus;takeover</b>
<br>
Any <i>mdmon</i> which is currently running is killed and a
new instance is started. This should be run during in the
boot sequence if an initramfs was used, so that any mdmon
running from the initramfs will not hold the initramfs
active.</p>
