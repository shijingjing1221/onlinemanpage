<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual is
an attempt to assist beginners in understanding the concepts
of RRDtool. It sheds a light on differences between RRDtool
and other databases. With help of an example, it explains
the structure of RRDtool database. This is followed by an
overview of the &quot;graph&quot; feature of RRDtool. At the
end, it has sample scripts that illustrate the
usage/wrapping of RRDtool within Shell or Perl scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What makes
RRDtool so special?</b> <br>
RRDtool is <small>GNU</small> licensed software developed by
Tobias Oetiker, a system manager at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology. Though it is a database, there are
distinct differences between RRDtool databases and other
databases as listed below:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>RRDtool stores data; that makes it a back-end tool. The
RRDtool command set allows the creation of graphs; that
makes it a front-end tool as well. Other databases just
store data and can not create graphs.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In case of linear databases, new data gets appended at
the bottom of the database table. Thus its size keeps on
increasing, whereas the size of an RRDtool database is
determined at creation time. Imagine an RRDtool database as
the perimeter of a circle. Data is added along the
perimeter. When new data reaches the starting point, it
overwrites existing data. This way, the size of an RRDtool
database always remains constant. The name &quot;Round
Robin&quot; stems from this behavior.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Other databases store the values as supplied. RRDtool
can be configured to calculate the rate of change from the
previous to the current value and store this information
instead.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Other databases get updated when values are supplied.
The RRDtool database is structured in such a way that it
needs data at predefined time intervals. If it does not get
a new value during the interval, it stores an
<small>UNKNOWN</small> value for that interval. So, when
using the RRDtool database, it is imperative to use scripts
that run at regular intervals to ensure a constant data flow
to update the RRDtool database.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RRDtool is
designed to store time series of data. With every data
update, an associated time stamp is stored. Time is always
expressed in seconds passed since epoch
(01&minus;01&minus;1970). RRDtool can be installed on Unix
as well as Windows. It comes with a command set to carry out
various operations on <small>RRD</small> databases. This
command set can be accessed from the command line, as well
as from Shell or Perl scripts. The scripts act as wrappers
for accessing data stored in RRDtool databases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Understanding
by an example</b> <br>
The structure of an <small>RRD</small> database is different
than other linear databases. Other databases define tables
with columns, and many other parameters. These definitions
sometimes are very complex, especially in large databases.
RRDtool databases are primarily used for monitoring purposes
and hence are very simple in structure. The parameters that
need to be defined are variables that hold values and
archives of those values. Being time sensitive, a couple of
time related parameters are also defined. Because of its
structure, the definition of an RRDtool database also
includes a provision to specify specific actions to take in
the absence of update values. Data Source (
<small>DS</small> ), heartbeat, Date Source Type (
<small>DST</small> ), Round Robin Archive (
<small>RRA</small> ), and Consolidation Function (
<small>CF</small> ) are some of the terminologies related to
RRDtool databases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
of a database and the terminology associated with it can be
best explained with an example.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> rrdtool create target.rrd \
         &minus;&minus;start 1023654125 \
         &minus;&minus;step 300 \
         DS:mem:GAUGE:600:0:671744 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:24 \
         RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:31</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates a database named <i>target.rrd</i>. Start time
(1&rsquo;023&rsquo;654&rsquo;125) is specified in total
number of seconds since epoch (time in seconds since
01&minus;01&minus;1970). While updating the database, the
update time is also specified. This update time
<small>MUST</small> be large (later) then start time and
<small>MUST</small> be in seconds since epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The step of 300
seconds indicates that database expects new values every 300
seconds. The wrapper script should be scheduled to run every
<b>step</b> seconds so that it updates the database every
<b>step</b> seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>DS</small>
(Data Source) is the actual variable which relates to the
parameter on the device that is monitored. Its syntax is</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> DS:variable_name:DST:heartbeat:min:max</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>DS</small></b>
is a key word. <tt>&quot;variable_name&quot;</tt> is a name
under which the parameter is saved in the database. There
can be as many DSs in a database as needed. After every step
interval, a new value of <small>DS</small> is supplied to
update the database. This value is also called Primary Data
Point <b>( <small>PDP</small> )</b>. In our example
mentioned above, a new <small>PDP</small> is generated every
300 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note, that if
you do <small>NOT</small> supply new data points exactly
every 300 seconds, this is not a problem, RRDtool will
interpolate the data accordingly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>DST</small></b>
(Data Source Type) defines the type of the <small>DS</small>
. It can be <small>COUNTER</small> , <small>DERIVE</small> ,
<small>ABSOLUTE</small> , <small>GAUGE</small> . A
<small>DS</small> declared as <small>COUNTER</small> will
save the rate of change of the value over a step period.
This assumes that the value is always increasing (the
difference between the current and the previous value is
greater than 0). Traffic counters on a router are an ideal
candidate for using <small>COUNTER</small> as
<small>DST</small> . <small>DERIVE</small> is the same as
<small>COUNTER</small> , but it allows negative values as
well. If you want to see the rate of <i>change</i> in free
disk space on your server, then you might want to use the
<small>DERIVE</small> data type. <small>ABSOLUTE</small>
also saves the rate of change, but it assumes that the
previous value is set to 0. The difference between the
current and the previous value is always equal to the
current value. Thus it just stores the current value divided
by the step interval (300 seconds in our example).
<small>GAUGE</small> does not save the rate of change. It
saves the actual value itself. There are no divisions or
calculations. Memory consumption in a server is a typical
example of gauge. The difference between the different types
DSTs can be explained better with the following example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> Values       = 300, 600, 900, 1200
 Step         = 300 seconds
 COUNTER DS   =    1,  1,   1,    1
 DERIVE DS    =    1,  1,   1,    1
 ABSOLUTE DS  =    1,  2,   3,    4
 GAUGE DS     = 300, 600, 900, 1200</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next
parameter is <b>heartbeat</b>. In our example, heartbeat is
600 seconds. If the database does not get a new
<small>PDP</small> within 300 seconds, it will wait for
another 300 seconds (total 600 seconds). If it doesn&rsquo;t
receive any <small>PDP</small> within 600 seconds, it will
save an <small>UNKNOWN</small> value into the database. This
<small>UNKNOWN</small> value is a special feature of RRDtool
&minus; it is much better than to assume a missing value was
0 (zero) or any other number which might also be a valid
data value. For example, the traffic flow counter on a
router keeps increasing. Lets say, a value is missed for an
interval and 0 is stored instead of <small>UNKNOWN</small> .
Now when the next value becomes available, it will calculate
the difference between the current value and the previous
value (0) which is not correct. So, inserting the value
<small>UNKNOWN</small> makes much more sense here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next two
parameters are the minimum and maximum value, respectively.
If the variable to be stored has predictable maximum and
minimum values, this should be specified here. Any update
value falling out of this range will be stored as
<small>UNKNOWN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next line
declares a round robin archive ( <small>RRA</small> ). The
syntax for declaring an <small>RRA</small> is</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> RRA:CF:xff:step:rows</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>RRA</small>
is the keyword to declare RRAs. The consolidation function (
<small>CF</small> ) can be <small>AVERAGE</small> ,
<small>MINIMUM</small> , <small>MAXIMUM</small> , and
<small>LAST</small> . The concept of the consolidated data
point ( <small>CDP</small> ) comes into the picture here. A
<small>CDP</small> is CFed (averaged, maximum/minimum value
or last value) from <i>step</i> number of PDPs. This
<small>RRA</small> will hold <i>rows</i> CDPs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lets have a
look at the example above. For the first <small>RRA</small>
, 12 (steps) PDPs ( <small>DS</small> variables) are
AVERAGEed ( <small>CF</small> ) to form one
<small>CDP</small> . 24 (rows) of theses CDPs are archived.
Each <small>PDP</small> occurs at 300 seconds. 12 PDPs
represent 12 times 300 seconds which is 1 hour. It means 1
<small>CDP</small> (which is equal to 12 PDPs) represents
data worth 1 hour. 24 such CDPs represent 1 day (1 hour
times 24 CDPs). This means, this <small>RRA</small> is an
archive for one day. After 24 CDPs, <small>CDP</small>
number 25 will replace the 1st <small>CDP</small> . The
second <small>RRA</small> saves 31 CDPs; each
<small>CPD</small> represents an <small>AVERAGE</small>
value for a day (288 PDPs, each covering 300 seconds = 24
hours). Therefore this <small>RRA</small> is an archive for
one month. A single database can have many RRAs. If there
are multiple DSs, each individual <small>RRA</small> will
save data for all the DSs in the database. For example, if a
database has 3 DSs and daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
RRAs are declared, then each <small>RRA</small> will hold
data from all 3 data sources.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Graphical
Magic</b> <br>
Another important feature of RRDtool is its ability to
create graphs. The &quot;graph&quot; command uses the
&quot;fetch&quot; command internally to retrieve values from
the database. With the retrieved values it draws graphs as
defined by the parameters supplied on the command line. A
single graph can show different <small>DS</small> (Data
Sources) from a database. It is also possible to show the
values from more than one database in a single graph. Often,
it is necessary to perform some math on the values retrieved
from the database before plotting them. For example, in
<small>SNMP</small> replies, memory consumption values are
usually specified in KBytes and traffic flow on interfaces
is specified in Bytes. Graphs for these values will be more
meaningful if values are represented in MBytes and mbps. The
RRDtool graph command allows to define such conversions.
Apart from mathematical calculations, it is also possible to
perform logical operations such as greater than, less than,
and if/then/else. If a database contains more than one
<small>RRA</small> archive, then a question may arise
&minus; how does RRDtool decide which <small>RRA</small>
archive to use for retrieving the values? RRDtool looks at
several things when making its choice. First it makes sure
that the <small>RRA</small> covers as much of the graphing
time frame as possible. Second it looks at the resolution of
the <small>RRA</small> compared to the resolution of the
graph. It tries to find one which has the same or higher
better resolution. With the &quot;&minus;r&quot; option you
can force RRDtool to assume a different resolution than the
one calculated from the pixel width of the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Values of
different variables can be presented in 5 different shapes
in a graph &minus; <small>AREA</small> ,
<small>LINE1</small> , <small>LINE2</small> ,
<small>LINE3</small> , and <small>STACK</small> .
<small>AREA</small> is represented by a solid colored area
with values as the boundary of this area.
<small>LINE1/2/3</small> (increasing width) are just plain
lines representing the values. <small>STACK</small> is also
an area but it is &quot;stack&quot;ed on top
<small>AREA</small> or <small>LINE1/2/3</small> . Another
important thing to note is that variables are plotted in the
order they are defined in the graph command. Therefore care
must be taken to define <small>STACK</small> only after
defining <small>AREA/LINE</small> . It is also possible to
put formatted comments within the graph. Detailed
instructions can be found in the graph manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Wrapping
RRDtool within Shell/Perl script</b> <br>
After understanding RRDtool it is now a time to actually use
RRDtool in scripts. Tasks involved in network management are
data collection, data storage, and data retrieval. In the
following example, the previously created target.rrd
database is used. Data collection and data storage is done
using Shell scripts. Data retrieval and report generation is
done using Perl scripts. These scripts are shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Shell script
(collects data, updates database)</i></p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> #!/bin/sh

 snmpwalk &minus;c public 192.168.1.250 hrSWRunPerfMem &gt; snmp_reply
     total_mem=`awk 'BEGIN {tot_mem=0}
                           { if ($NF == &quot;KBytes&quot;)
                             {tot_mem=tot_mem+$(NF&minus;1)}
                           }
                     END {print tot_mem}' snmp_reply`
     # I can use N as a replacement for the current time
     rrdtool update target.rrd N:$total_mem
     # sleep until the next 300 seconds are full
