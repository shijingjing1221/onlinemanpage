<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These library
functions are part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system()</b>
is a lot like the standard C library <b>system()</b>
subroutine. It runs a shell and has that shell execute a
shell command that you specify. But <b>pm_system()</b> gives
you more control over the Standard Input and Standard Output
of that shell command than <b>system()</b>. <b>system()</b>
passes to the shell command as Standard Input and Output
whatever is the Standard Input and Output of the process
that calls <b>system()</b>. But with <b>pm_system()</b>, you
specify as arguments subroutines to execute to generate the
shell command&rsquo;s Standard Input stream and to process
the shell command&rsquo;s Standard Output stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your Standard
Input feeder subroutine can generate the stream in limitless
ways. <b>pm_system()</b> gives it a file descriptor of a
pipe to which to write the stream it generates.
<b>pm_system()</b> hooks up the other end of that pipe to
the shell command&rsquo;s Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Likewise, your
Standard Output accepter subroutine can do anything it wants
with the stream it gets. <b>pm_system()</b> gives it a file
descriptor of a pipe from which to read the stream.
<b>pm_system()</b> hooks up the other end of that pipe to
the shell command&rsquo;s Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>stdinFeeder</i> is a function pointer that identifies
your Standard Input feeder subroutine. <b>pm_system()</b>
runs it in a child process and waits for that process to
terminate (and accepts its completion status) before
returning. <i>feederParm</i> is the argument that
<b>pm_system()</b> passes to the subroutine; it is opaque to
<b>pm_system()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you pass
<i>stdinFeeder</i> = NULL, <b>pm_system()</b> simply passes
your current Standard Input stream to the shell command (as
<b>system()</b> would do), and does not create a child
process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>stdoutAccepter</i> is a function pointer that identifies
your Standard Output accepter subroutine. <b>pm_system()</b>
calls it in the current process. <i>accepterParm</i> is an
argument analogous to <i>feederParm</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you pass
<i>stdoutAccepter</i> = NULL, <b>pm_system()</b> simply
passes your current Standard Output stream to the shell
command (as <b>system()</b> would do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>shellCommand</i> is a null-terminated string containing
the shell command that the shell is to execute. It can be
any command that means something to the shell and can take a
pipe for Standard Input and Output. Example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ppmbrighten -v 100 | pamdepth 255 | pamscale .5</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system()</b>
creates a child process to run the shell and waits for that
process to terminate (and accepts its completion status)
before returning.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system_lp()
<br>
pm_system_lp()</b> is like <b>pm_system()</b> except that
instead of running a shell, which in turn typically runs
another program, you run a program of your choice
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Argument
<i>progName</i> identifies the program to run, the same way
as with <b>execlp()</b> or a shell command: if it contains a
slash (/), it is the full name of the file that contains the
program. If not, it is a name to be looked up in the
system&rsquo;s program search path (determined by the PATH
environment variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You identify
the arguments to the program the same way as for
<b>execlp()</b>: with the variable arguments at the end of
the <b>pm_system_lp()</b> argument list. Each is a
NUL-terminated string. The last argument <i>must</i> be NULL
to tell <b>pm_system_lp()</b> where the arguments end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
first argument (&rsquo;arg0&rsquo;) to a program is
conventionally the first word of the command used to run the
program, as if it were being run due to a shell command. In
other words, typically the name of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    pm_system_lp(&rsquo;pnmtojpeg&rsquo;, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                 &rsquo;pnmtojpeg&rsquo;, &rsquo;mypicture.jpg&rsquo;, &rsquo;-quality=50&rsquo;, NULL);</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system_lp()</b>
is much safer than <b>pm_system()</b> when your program
computes the arguments or gets them from a user. If you
build a shell command using such arguments, unless
you&rsquo;re really careful, you may end up building a shell
command that does something very different from what you
intended, because the argument could contain characters that
mean something to the shell such as &rsquo;|&rsquo;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system_lp()</b>
can also be considerably faster that <b>pm_system()</b>,
since it skips the whole running of the shell.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pm_system_vp()
<br>
pm_system_vp()</b> is like <b>pm_system_lp()</b> except that
instead of supplying the program arguments as variable
arguments, you supply them as an array, as with
<b>execvp()</b>. A NULL element in the array identifies the
end of the arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>
<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    const char * argArray[3];

    argArray[0] = &rsquo;pnmtojpeg&rsquo;;
    argArray[1] = &rsquo;-quality=50&rsquo;;
    argArray[2] = NULL;


    pm_system_vp(&rsquo;pnmtojpeg&rsquo;, argArray, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);</pre>


<h2>Applications
<a name="Applications"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The point of
<b>pm_system()</b> and friends is to allow you to write a C
program that uses other programs internally, as a shell
script would. This is particularly desirable with Netpbm,
because Netpbm consists of a lot of programs that perform
basic graphic manipulations and you&rsquo;d like to be able
to build a program that does a more sophisticated graphic
manipulation by calling the more basic Netpbm programs.
These building block programs typically take input from
Standard Input and write output to Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The obvious
alternative is to use a higher level language -- Bourne
Shell or Perl, for example. But often you want your program
to do manipulations of your graphical data that are easier
and more efficient in C. Or you want to use the Netpbm
subroutine library in your program. The Netpbm subroutine
library is a C-linkage library; the subroutines in it are
not usable from a Bourne Shell or Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typical use
of <b>pm_system()</b> is to place the contents of some
graphical image file in memory, run a Netpbm program against
it, and have what would ordinarily go into an output file in
memory too, for further processing. To do that, you can use
the memory buffer Standard Input feeder and Standard Output
accepter described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your program
uses the Netpbm subroutine library to read, write, and
manipulate images, you may have an image in an array of PAM
tuples. If you want to manipulate that image with a Netpbm
program (perhaps remap the colors using <b>pnmremap</b>),
you can use the pamtuple Standard Input feeder and Standard
Output acceptor described below.</p>

<h2>Broken Pipe Behavior
<a name="Broken Pipe Behavior"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you set up
a shell command to take input from a pipe, as you do with
<b>pm_system()</b>, you need to understand how pipes work
with respect to the programs at either end of the pipe
agreeing to how much data is to be transferred. Here are
some notes on that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is normal to
read a pipe before the process on the other end has written
the data you hope to read, and it is normal to write to a
pipe before the process on the other end has tried to read
your data. Writes to a pipe can be buffered until the
reading end requests the data. A process reading or writing
a pipe can block until the other end is ready. Or a read or
write can complete with an indication that the other end is
not ready at the moment and therefore no data, or less data
than was requested, was transferred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pipe is
normally controlled by the writing end. When you read from a
pipe, you keep reading until the program on the other end of
the pipe closes it, and then you get an end-of-file
indication. You then normally close the reading end of the
pipe, since it is no longer useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you close
the reading end of a pipe before getting the end-of-file
indication and the writer subsequently tries to write to the
pipe, that is an error condition for the writer. In a
typical default Unix environment, that error causes the
writer to receive a SIGPIPE signal and that signal causes
the writer process to terminate abnormally. But if,
alternatively, the writer has ordered that SIGPIPE be
blocked, ignored, or handled, the signal does not cause the
death of the writer. Instead, the write operation simply
completes with an error indication.</p>

<h2>Standard Feeders And Acceptors
<a name="Standard Feeders And Acceptors"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can supply
anything you like as a Standard Input feeder or Standard
Output acceptor, but the Netpbm subroutine library comes
with a few that perform commonly needed functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Memory
Buffer</b> <br>
These routines are for when you just want to treat an area
of memory as a file. If the shell command would ordinarily
read a 513 byte regular file from its Standard Input, you
want it to take 513 bytes from a certain address in your
process&rsquo; memory. Whatever bytes the shell command
wants to write to its output file you want it to store at
another address in your process&rsquo; memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Standard
Input feeder for this is called <b>pm_feed_from_memory</b>.
The Standard Output accepter is
<b>pm_accept_to_memory</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For both of
these, the argument is the address of a <b>struct
bufferDesc</b>, which is defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">struct
bufferDesc { <br>
unsigned int size; <br>
unsigned char * buffer; <br>
unsigned int * bytesTransferredP; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>size</i> is
the size of the memory buffer and <i>buffer</i> is its
location in memory (address). The Standard Input feeder will
attempt to feed the entire buffer to the shell
command&rsquo;s Standard Input; the Standard Output accepter
will not accept any more data from the shell command&rsquo;s
Standard Output than will fit in the buffer. Both return the
actual amount of data read or written, in bytes, at the
location identified by <i>bytesTransferredP</i>. Unless
<b>bytesTransferredP</b> is NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because a
process typically terminates abnormally when it is not able
to write everything to a pipe that it wanted to,
<i>bytesTransferredP</i> is not usually useful in the
Standard Input feeder case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pamtuple</b>
<br>
These routines are for when you have images in memory in the
data structures used by the PAM family of subroutines in the
Netpbm library -- i.e. struct PAM and an array of struct
tuple. With these routines, you can run a Netpbm program
against such an image just as you would against the same
image in a regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Standard
Input feeder for this is called
<b>pm_feed_from_pamtuples</b>. The Standard Output accepter
is <b>pm_accept_to_pamtuples</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For both of
these, the argument is the address of a <b>struct
pamtuples</b>, which is defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">struct
pamtuples { <br>
struct pam * pamP; <br>
tuple *** tuplesP; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
Standard Input feeder, you supply a struct pam, valid up
through the <i>tuple_type</i> member (except it
doesn&rsquo;t matter what the <i>file</i> member is) and
array of tuples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
Standard Output Accepter, you supply only space in memory
for the struct pam and the address of the tuple array. The
routine fills in the struct pam up through the
<i>tuple_type</i> member (except leaves the <i>file</i>
member undefined) and allocates space for the tuple array
with malloc(). You are responsible for freeing that
memory.</p>
