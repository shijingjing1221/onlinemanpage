<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>AHHHHHHH</small>
!!!! <small>NOT TESTING</small> ! Anything but testing! Beat
me, whip me, send me to Detroit, but don&rsquo;t make me
write tests!</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>*sob*</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Besides, I
don&rsquo;t know how to write the damned things.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Is this you? Is
writing tests right up there with writing documentation and
having your fingernails pulled out? Did you open up a test
and read</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ######## We start with some black magic</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and decide
that&rsquo;s quite enough for you?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s ok.
That&rsquo;s all gone now. We&rsquo;ve done all the black
magic for you. And here are the tricks...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Nuts and
bolts of testing.</b> <br>
Here&rsquo;s the most basic test program.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    print &quot;1..1\n&quot;;
    print 1 + 1 == 2 ? &quot;ok 1\n&quot; : &quot;not ok 1\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">since 1 + 1 is
2, it prints:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..1
    ok 1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What this says
is: <tt>1..1</tt> &quot;I&rsquo;m going to run one
test.&quot; [1] <tt>&quot;ok 1&quot;</tt> &quot;The first
test passed&quot;. And that&rsquo;s about all magic there is
to testing. Your basic unit of testing is the <i>ok</i>. For
each thing you test, an <tt>&quot;ok&quot;</tt> is printed.
Simple. <b>Test::Harness</b> interprets your test results to
determine if you succeeded or failed (more on that
later).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writing all
these print statements rapidly gets tedious. Fortunately,
there&rsquo;s <b>Test::Simple</b>. It has one function,
<tt>&quot;ok()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 1;
    ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and that does
the same thing as the code above. <tt>&quot;ok()&quot;</tt>
is the backbone of Perl testing, and we&rsquo;ll be using it
instead of roll-your-own from here on. If
<tt>&quot;ok()&quot;</tt> gets a true value, the test
passes. False, it fails.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;
    ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );
    ok( 2 + 2 == 5 );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">from that
comes</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..2
    ok 1
    not ok 2
    #     Failed test (test.pl at line 5)
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 2.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1..2
&quot;I&rsquo;m going to run two tests.&quot; This number is
used to ensure your test program ran all the way through and
didn&rsquo;t die or skip some tests. <tt>&quot;ok
1&quot;</tt> &quot;The first test passed.&quot;
<tt>&quot;not ok 2&quot;</tt> &quot;The second test
failed&quot;. Test::Simple helpfully prints out some extra
commentary about your tests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not
scary. Come, hold my hand. We&rsquo;re going to give an
example of testing a module. For our example, we&rsquo;ll be
testing a date library, <b>Date::ICal</b>. It&rsquo;s on
<small>CPAN,</small> so download a copy and follow along.
[2]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where to
start?</b> <br>
This is the hardest part of testing, where do you start?
People often get overwhelmed at the apparent enormity of the
task of testing a whole module. Best place to start is at
the beginning. Date::ICal is an object-oriented module, and
that means you start by making an object. So we test
<tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;
    use Date::ICal;
    my $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new;         # create an object
    ok( defined $ical );                # check that we got something
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;isa('Date::ICal') );     # and it's the right class</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">run that and
you should get:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..2
    ok 1
    ok 2</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">congratulations,
you&rsquo;ve written your first useful test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Names</b>
<br>
That output isn&rsquo;t terribly descriptive, is it? When
you have two tests you can figure out which one is #2, but
what if you have 102?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each test can
be given a little descriptive name as the second argument to
<tt>&quot;ok()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;
    ok( defined $ical,              'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;isa('Date::ICal'),   &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So now
you&rsquo;d see...</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..2
    ok 1 &minus; new() returned something
    ok 2 &minus;   and it's the right class</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Test the
manual</b> <br>
Simplest way to build up a decent testing suite is to just
test what the manual says it does. [3] Let&rsquo;s pull
something out of the &quot; <small>SYNOPSIS&quot;</small> in
Date::ICal and test that all its bits work.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 8;
    use Date::ICal;
    $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( year =&gt; 1964, month =&gt; 10, day =&gt; 16,
                             hour =&gt; 16, min =&gt; 12, sec =&gt; 47,
                             tz =&gt; '0530' );
    ok( defined $ical,            'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;isa('Date::ICal'), &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;sec   == 47,       '  sec()'   );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;min   == 12,       '  min()'   );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;hour  == 16,       '  hour()'  );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;day   == 17,       '  day()'   );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;month == 10,       '  month()' );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;year  == 1964,     '  year()'  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">run that and
you get:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..8
    ok 1 &minus; new() returned something
    ok 2 &minus;   and it's the right class
    ok 3 &minus;   sec()
    ok 4 &minus;   min()
    ok 5 &minus;   hour()
    not ok 6 &minus;   day()
    #     Failed test (&minus; at line 16)
    ok 7 &minus;   month()
    ok 8 &minus;   year()
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whoops, a
failure! [4] Test::Simple helpfully lets us know on what
line the failure occurred, but not much else. We were
supposed to get 17, but we didn&rsquo;t. What did we get??
Dunno. We&rsquo;ll have to re-run the test in the debugger
or throw in some print statements to find out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead,
we&rsquo;ll switch from <b>Test::Simple</b> to
<b>Test::More</b>. <b>Test::More</b> does everything
<b>Test::Simple</b> does, and more! In fact, Test::More does
things <i>exactly</i> the way Test::Simple does. You can
literally swap Test::Simple out and put Test::More in its
place. That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::More does
more than Test::Simple. The most important difference at
this point is it provides more informative ways to say
&quot;ok&quot;. Although you can write almost any test with
a generic <tt>&quot;ok()&quot;</tt>, it can&rsquo;t tell you
what went wrong. Instead, we&rsquo;ll use the
<tt>&quot;is()&quot;</tt> function, which lets us declare
that something is supposed to be the same as something
else:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::More tests =&gt; 8;
    use Date::ICal;
    $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( year =&gt; 1964, month =&gt; 10, day =&gt; 16,
                             hour =&gt; 16, min =&gt; 12, sec =&gt; 47,
                             tz =&gt; '0530' );
    ok( defined $ical,            'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical&minus;&gt;isa('Date::ICal'), &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;sec,     47,       '  sec()'   );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;min,     12,       '  min()'   );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;hour,    16,       '  hour()'  );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;day,     17,       '  day()'   );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;month,   10,       '  month()' );
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;year,    1964,     '  year()'  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Is
<tt>&quot;$ical&minus;&gt;sec&quot;</tt> 47?&quot; &quot;Is
<tt>&quot;$ical&minus;&gt;min&quot;</tt> 12?&quot; With
<tt>&quot;is()&quot;</tt> in place, you get some more
information</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..8
    ok 1 &minus; new() returned something
    ok 2 &minus;   and it's the right class
    ok 3 &minus;   sec()
    ok 4 &minus;   min()
    ok 5 &minus;   hour()
    not ok 6 &minus;   day()
    #     Failed test (&minus; at line 16)
    #          got: '16'
    #     expected: '17'
    ok 7 &minus;   month()
    ok 8 &minus;   year()
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">letting us know
that <tt>&quot;$ical&minus;&gt;day&quot;</tt> returned 16,
but we expected 17. A quick check shows that the code is
working fine, we made a mistake when writing up the tests.
Just change it to:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    is( $ical&minus;&gt;day,     16,       '  day()'   );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and everything
works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So any time
you&rsquo;re doing a &quot;this equals that&quot; sort of
test, use <tt>&quot;is()&quot;</tt>. It even works on
arrays. The test is always in scalar context, so you can
test how many elements are in a list this way. [5]</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    is( @foo, 5, 'foo has 5 elements' );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sometimes
the tests are wrong</b> <br>
Which brings us to a very important lesson. Code has bugs.
Tests are code. Ergo, tests have bugs. A failing test could
mean a bug in the code, but don&rsquo;t discount the
possibility that the test is wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the flip
side, don&rsquo;t be tempted to prematurely declare a test
incorrect just because you&rsquo;re having trouble finding
the bug. Invalidating a test isn&rsquo;t something to be
taken lightly, and don&rsquo;t use it as a cop out to avoid
work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Testing lots
of values</b> <br>
We&rsquo;re going to be wanting to test a lot of dates here,
trying to trick the code with lots of different edge cases.
Does it work before 1970? After 2038? Before 1904? Do years
after 10,000 give it trouble? Does it get leap years right?
We could keep repeating the code above, or we could set up a
little try/expect loop.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More tests =&gt; 32;
    use Date::ICal;
    my %ICal_Dates = (
            # An ICal string     And the year, month, day
            #                    hour, minute and second we expect.
            '19971024T120000' =&gt;    # from the docs.
                                [ 1997, 10, 24, 12,  0,  0 ],
            '20390123T232832' =&gt;    # after the Unix epoch
                                [ 2039,  1, 23, 23, 28, 32 ],
            '19671225T000000' =&gt;    # before the Unix epoch
                                [ 1967, 12, 25,  0,  0,  0 ],
            '18990505T232323' =&gt;    # before the MacOS epoch
                                [ 1899,  5,  5, 23, 23, 23 ],
    );
    while( my($ical_str, $expect) = each %ICal_Dates ) {
        my $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( ical =&gt; $ical_str );
        ok( defined $ical,            &quot;new(ical =&gt; '$ical_str')&quot; );
        ok( $ical&minus;&gt;isa('Date::ICal'), &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;year,    $expect&minus;&gt;[0],     '  year()'  );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;month,   $expect&minus;&gt;[1],     '  month()' );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;day,     $expect&minus;&gt;[2],     '  day()'   );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;hour,    $expect&minus;&gt;[3],     '  hour()'  );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;min,     $expect&minus;&gt;[4],     '  min()'   );
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;sec,     $expect&minus;&gt;[5],     '  sec()'   );
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So now we can
test bunches of dates by just adding them to
<tt>%ICal_Dates</tt>. Now that it&rsquo;s less work to test
with more dates, you&rsquo;ll be inclined to just throw more
in as you think of them. Only problem is, every time we add
to that we have to keep adjusting the <tt>&quot;use
Test::More tests =&gt; ##&quot;</tt> line. That can rapidly
get annoying. There&rsquo;s two ways to make this work
better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, we can
calculate the plan dynamically using the
<tt>&quot;plan()&quot;</tt> function.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More;
    use Date::ICal;
    my %ICal_Dates = (
        ...same as before...
    );
    # For each key in the hash we're running 8 tests.
    plan tests =&gt; keys(%ICal_Dates) * 8;
    ...and then your tests...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or to be even
more flexible, we use <tt>&quot;no_plan&quot;</tt>. This
means we&rsquo;re just running some tests, don&rsquo;t know
how many. [6]</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More 'no_plan';   # instead of tests =&gt; 32</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">now we can just
add tests and not have to do all sorts of math to figure out
how many we&rsquo;re running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Informative
names</b> <br>
Take a look at this line here</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ok( defined $ical,            &quot;new(ical =&gt; '$ical_str')&quot; );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">we&rsquo;ve
added more detail about what we&rsquo;re testing and the
ICal string itself we&rsquo;re trying out to the name. So
you get results like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ok 25 &minus; new(ical =&gt; '19971024T120000')
    ok 26 &minus;   and it's the right class
    ok 27 &minus;   year()
    ok 28 &minus;   month()
    ok 29 &minus;   day()
    ok 30 &minus;   hour()
    ok 31 &minus;   min()
    ok 32 &minus;   sec()</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if something in
there fails, you&rsquo;ll know which one it was and that
will make tracking down the problem easier. So try to put a
bit of debugging information into the test names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Describe what
the tests test, to make debugging a failed test easier for
you or for the next person who runs your test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Skipping
tests</b> <br>
Poking around in the existing Date::ICal tests, I found this
in <i>t/01sanity.t</i> [7]</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use Test::More tests =&gt; 7;
    use Date::ICal;
    # Make sure epoch time is being handled sanely.
    my $t1 = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( epoch =&gt; 0 );
    is( $t1&minus;&gt;epoch, 0,          &quot;Epoch time of 0&quot; );
    # XXX This will only work on unix systems.
    is( $t1&minus;&gt;ical, '19700101Z', &quot;  epoch to ical&quot; );
    is( $t1&minus;&gt;year,  1970,       &quot;  year()&quot;  );
    is( $t1&minus;&gt;month, 1,          &quot;  month()&quot; );
    is( $t1&minus;&gt;day,   1,          &quot;  day()&quot;   );
    # like the tests above, but starting with ical instead of epoch
    my $t2 = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( ical =&gt; '19700101Z' );
    is( $t2&minus;&gt;ical, '19700101Z', &quot;Start of epoch in ICal notation&quot; );
    is( $t2&minus;&gt;epoch, 0,          &quot;  and back to ICal&quot; );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The beginning
of the epoch is different on most non-Unix operating systems
[8]. Even though Perl smooths out the differences for the
most part, certain ports do it differently. MacPerl is one
off the top of my head. [9] So rather than just putting a
comment in the test, we can explicitly say it&rsquo;s never
going to work and skip the test.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More tests =&gt; 7;

        is( $t1&minus;&gt;year,  1970,       &quot;  year()&quot;  );
        is( $t1&minus;&gt;month, 1,          &quot;  month()&quot; );

        my $t2 = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new( ical =&gt; '19700101Z' );
        is( $t2&minus;&gt;ical, '19700101Z', &quot;Start of epoch in ICal notation&quot; );

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A little bit of
magic happens here. When running on anything but MacOS, all
the tests run normally. But when on MacOS,
<tt>&quot;skip()&quot;</tt> causes the entire contents of
the <small>SKIP</small> block to be jumped over. It&rsquo;s
never run. Instead, it prints special output that tells
Test::Harness that the tests have been skipped.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..7
    ok 1 &minus; Epoch time of 0
    ok 2 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS
    ok 3 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS
    ok 4 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS
    ok 5 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS
    ok 6 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS
    ok 7 # skip epoch to ICal not working on MacOS</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means your
tests won&rsquo;t fail on MacOS. This means less emails from
MacPerl users telling you about failing tests that you know
will never work. You&rsquo;ve got to be careful with skip
tests. These are for tests which don&rsquo;t work and
<i>never will</i>. It is not for skipping genuine bugs
(we&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tests are
wholly and completely skipped. [10] This will work.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    SKIP: {
        skip(&quot;I don't wanna die!&quot;);
        die, die, die, die, die;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Todo
tests</b> <br>
Thumbing through the Date::ICal man page, I came across
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   ical
       $ical_string = $ical&minus;&gt;ical;
   Retrieves, or sets, the date on the object, using any
   valid ICal date/time string.</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Retrieves
or sets&quot;. Hmmm, didn&rsquo;t see a test for using
<tt>&quot;ical()&quot;</tt> to set the date in the
Date::ICal test suite. So I&rsquo;ll write one.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;
    use Date::ICal;
    my $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new;
    $ical&minus;&gt;ical('20201231Z');
    is( $ical&minus;&gt;ical, '20201231Z',   'Setting via ical()' );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">run that and I
get</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..1
    not ok 1 &minus; Setting via ical()
    #     Failed test (&minus; at line 6)
    #          got: '20010814T233649Z'
    #     expected: '20201231Z'
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 1.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whoops! Looks
like it&rsquo;s unimplemented. Let&rsquo;s assume we
don&rsquo;t have the time to fix this. [11] Normally,
you&rsquo;d just comment out the test and put a note in a
todo list somewhere. Instead, we&rsquo;re going to
explicitly state &quot;this test will fail&quot; by wrapping
it in a <tt>&quot;TODO&quot;</tt> block.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;
    TODO: {
        local $TODO = 'ical($ical) not yet implemented';
        my $ical = Date::ICal&minus;&gt;new;
        $ical&minus;&gt;ical('20201231Z');
        is( $ical&minus;&gt;ical, '20201231Z',   'Setting via ical()' );
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now when you
run, it&rsquo;s a little different:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1..1
    not ok 1 &minus; Setting via ical() # TODO ical($ical) not yet implemented
    #          got: '20010822T201551Z'
    #     expected: '20201231Z'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::More
doesn&rsquo;t say &quot;Looks like you failed 1 tests of
1&quot;. That &rsquo;# <small>TODO</small> &rsquo; tells
Test::Harness &quot;this is supposed to fail&quot; and it
treats a failure as a successful test. So you can write
tests even before you&rsquo;ve fixed the underlying
code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<small>TODO</small> test passes, Test::Harness will report
it &quot; <small>UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED&quot;.</small> When
that happens, you simply remove the <small>TODO</small>
block with <tt>&quot;local $TODO&quot;</tt> and turn it into
a real test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Testing with
taint mode.</b> <br>
Taint mode is a funny thing. It&rsquo;s the globalest of all
global features. Once you turn it on, it affects <i>all</i>
code in your program and <i>all</i> modules used (and all
the modules they use). If a single piece of code isn&rsquo;t
taint clean, the whole thing explodes. With that in mind,
it&rsquo;s very important to ensure your module works under
taint mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s very
simple to have your tests run under taint mode. Just throw a
<tt>&quot;&minus;T&quot;</tt> into the
<tt>&quot;#!&quot;</tt> line. Test::Harness will read the
switches in <tt>&quot;#!&quot;</tt> and use them to run your
tests.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;Tw
    ...test normally here...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So when you say
<tt>&quot;make test&quot;</tt> it will be run with taint
mode and warnings on.</p>
