<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS
hybrid filesystems.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
is capable of generating the <b>System Use Sharing Protocol
records (SUSP)</b> specified by the <b>Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol</b>. This is used to further describe
the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix host, and
provides information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX
permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If Joliet or
HFS hybrid command line options are specified,
<b>genisoimage</b> will create the additional filesystem
metadata needed for Joliet or HFS. Otherwise
<b>genisoimage</b> will generate a pure ISO9660
filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
can generate a <i>true</i> (or <i>shared</i>) HFS hybrid
filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when accessed
from other machines. HFS stands for <i>Hierarchical File
System</i> and is the native filesystem used on Macintosh
computers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an
alternative, <b>genisoimage</b> can generate the <i>Apple
Extensions to ISO9660</i> for each file. These extensions
provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder
flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the <b>HFS
MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS</b> section below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a
binary image which will correspond to an ISO9660 and/or HFS
filesystem when written to a block device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each file
written to the ISO9660 filesystem must have a filename in
the 8.3 format (up to 8 characters, period, up to 3
characters, all uppercase), even if Rock Ridge is in use.
This filename is used on systems that are not able to make
use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each
filename in each directory must be different from the other
filenames in the same directory. <b>genisoimage</b>
generally tries to form correct names by forcing the Unix
filename to uppercase and truncating as required, but often
this yields unsatisfactory results when the truncated names
are not all unique. <b>genisoimage</b> assigns weightings to
each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the same
are found, the name with the lower priority is renamed to
include a 3-digit number (guaranteed to be unique). For
example, the two files <i>foo.bar</i> and <i>foo.bar.~1~</i>
could be rendered as <i>FOO.BAR;1</i> and
<i>FOO000.BAR;1</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
various HFS options, <b>genisoimage</b> will attempt to
recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix file
formats and will copy the data and resource forks as well as
any relevant Finder information. See the <b>HFS MACINTOSH
FILE FORMATS</b> section below for more about formats
<b>genisoimage</b> supports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>genisoimage</b> is not designed to communicate with the
writer directly. Most writers have proprietary command sets
which vary from one manufacturer to another, and you need a
specialized tool to actually burn the disc. <b>wodim</b> is
one such tool. The latest version of <b>wodim</b> is
available from <i>http://www.cdrkit.org/</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pathspec</b>
is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the
ISO9660 filesystem. Multiple paths can be specified, and
<b>genisoimage</b> will merge the files found in all of the
specified path components to form the filesystem image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
<b>&minus;graft&minus;points</b> has been specified, it is
possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories
onto the cdrom image with names different than what they
have in the source filesystem. This is easiest to illustrate
with a couple of examples. Let&rsquo;s start by assuming
that a local file <i>../old.lis</i> exists, and you wish to
include it in the cdrom image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">foo/bar/=../old.lis</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will include
<i>old.lis</i> in the cdrom image at
<i>/foo/bar/old.lis</i>, while</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will include
<i>old.lis</i> in the cdrom image at <i>/foo/bar/xxx</i>.
The same sort of syntax can be used with directories as
well. <b>genisoimage</b> will create any directories
required such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image
&mdash; the directories do not need to appear in one of the
paths. By default, any directories that are created on the
fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be
owned by the person running <b>genisoimage</b>. If you wish
other permissions or owners of the intermediate directories,
see <b>&minus;uid</b>, <b>&minus;gid</b>,
<b>&minus;dir&minus;mode</b>, <b>&minus;file&minus;mode</b>
and <b>&minus;new&minus;dir&minus;mode</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
will also run on Windows machines when compiled with
Cygnus&rsquo; cygwin (available from
<i>http://www.cygwin.com/</i>). Therefore most references in
this man page to <i>Unix</i> can be replaced with
<i>Win32</i>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several options
can be specified as defaults in a <i>.genisoimagerc</i>
configuration file, as well as on the command line. If a
parameter is specified in both places, the setting from the
command line is used. For details on the format and possible
locations of this file, see <b>genisoimagerc</b>(5). <b><br>
&minus;abstract</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the abstract
filename. There is space for 37 characters. Equivalent to
<b>ABST</b> in the <i>.genisoimagerc</i> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A</b>
<i>application_id</i> <b><br>
&minus;appid</b> <i>application_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a text string that
will be written into the volume header. This should describe
the application that will be on the disc. There is space for
128 characters. Equivalent to <b>APPI</b> in the
<i>.genisoimagerc</i> file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;limited&minus;size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When processing files larger
than 2GiB which cannot be easily represented in ISO9660, add
them with a shrunk visible file size to ISO9660 and with the
correct visible file size to the UDF system. The result is
an inconsistent filesystem and users need to make sure that
they really use UDF rather than ISO9660 driver to read a
such disk. Implies enabling <b>&minus;udf.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;leading&minus;dots</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>&minus;ldots</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Allow ISO9660 filenames to begin with a period. Usually,
a leading dot is replaced with an underscore in order to
maintain MS-DOS compatibility.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This violates the ISO9660
standard, but it happens to work on many systems. Use with
caution.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;lowercase</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options allows lowercase
characters to appear in ISO9660 filenames. <br>
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work
on some systems. Use with caution.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;multidot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options allows more than
one dot to appear in ISO9660 filenames. A leading dot is not
affected by this option, it may be allowed separately using
<b>&minus;allow&minus;leading&minus;dots</b>. <br>
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;biblio</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the bibliographic
filename. There is space for 37 characters. Equivalent to
<b>BIBL</b> in the <i>.genisoimagerc</i> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;cache&minus;inodes
<br>
&minus;no&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable caching inode
and device numbers to find hard links to files. If
<b>genisoimage</b> finds a hard link (a file with multiple
names), the file will also be hard-linked on the CD, so the
file contents only appear once. This helps to save space.
<b>&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b> is default on Unix-like
operating systems, but
<b>&minus;no&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b> is default on some
other systems such as Cygwin, because it is not safe to
assume that inode numbers are unique on those systems. (Some
versions of Cygwin create fake inode numbers using a weak
hashing algorithm, which may produce duplicates.) If two
files have the same inode number but are not hard links to
the same file, <b>genisoimage &minus;cache&minus;inodes</b>
will not behave correctly.
<b>&minus;no&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b> is safe in all
situations, but in that case <b>genisoimage</b> cannot
detect hard links, so the resulting CD image may be larger
than necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;alpha&minus;boot</b>
<i>alpha_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an Alpha/SRM
bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to <b>genisoimage</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hppa&minus;bootloader</b>
<i>hppa_bootloader_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an HPPA bootable
CD. The pathname must be relative to the source path
specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. Other options are required,
at the very least a kernel filename and a boot command line.
See the <b>HPPA NOTES</b> section below for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hppa&minus;cmdline</b>
<i>hppa_boot_command_line</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the command line to
be passed to the HPPA boot loader when making a bootable CD.
Separate the parameters with spaces or commas. More options
must be passed to <b>genisoimage,</b> at the very least a
kernel filename and the boot loader filename. See the
<b>HPPA NOTES</b> section below for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hppa&minus;kernel&minus;32</b>
<i>hppa_kernel_32</i> <b><br>
&minus;hppa&minus;kernel&minus;64</b>
<i>hppa_kernel_64</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the 32-bit and/or 64-bit kernel images to be used when
making an HPPA bootable CD. The pathnames must be relative
to the source path specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. Other
options are required, at the very least the boot loader
filename and the boot command line. See the <b>HPPA
NOTES</b> section below for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hppa&minus;ramdisk</b>
<i>hppa_ramdisk_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the ramdisk image to be used when making an HPPA bootable
CD. The pathname must be relative to the source path
specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. This parameter is optional.
Other options are required, at the very least a kernel
filename and the boot command line. See the <b>HPPA
NOTES</b> section below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;mips&minus;boot</b>
<i>mips_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an SGI/big-endian
MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the
source path specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. This option may
be specified several times, to store up to 15 boot
images.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;mipsel&minus;boot</b>
<i>mipsel_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an
DEC/little-endian MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be
relative to the source path specified to
<b>genisoimage</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;B</b>
<i>img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e</i>
<b><br>
&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b>
<i>img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a comma-separated
list of boot images that are needed to make a bootable CD
for SPARC systems. Partition 0 is used for the ISO9660
image, the first image file is mapped to partition 1. The
comma-separated list may have up to 7 fields, including
empty fields. This option is required to make a bootable CD
for Sun SPARC systems. If <b>&minus;B</b> or
<b>&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b> has been specified, the first
sector of the resulting image will contain a Sun disk label.
This disk label specifies slice 0 for the ISO9660 image and
slices 1 to 7 for the boot images that have been specified
with this option. Byte offsets 512 to 8191 within each of
the additional boot images must contain a primary boot that
works for the appropriate SPARC architecture. The rest of
each of the images usually contains a UFS filesystem used
for the primary kernel boot stage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The implemented
boot method is the one found with SunOS 4.x and SunOS 5.x.
However, it does not depend on SunOS internals but only on
properties of the Open Boot prom, so it should be usable for
any OS for SPARC systems. For more information also see the
<b>NOTES</b> section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the special
filename <b>...</b> is used, the actual and all following
boot partitions are mapped to the previous partition. If
<b>genisoimage</b> is called with <b>&minus;G</b>
<i>image</i> <b>&minus;B</b> <i>...</i> all boot partitions
are mapped to the partition that contains the ISO9660
filesystem image and the generic boot image that is located
in the first 16 sectors of the disc is used for all
architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;G</b>
<i>generic_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the generic boot image to be used when making a generic
bootable CD. The boot image will be placed on the first 16
sectors of the CD, before the ISO9660 primary volume
descriptor. If this option is used together with
<b>&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b>, the Sun disk label will
overlay the first 512 bytes of the generic boot image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b</b>
<i>eltorito_boot_image</i> <b><br>
&minus;eltorito&minus;boot</b>
<i>eltorito_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an El Torito
bootable CD for x86 PCs. The pathname must be relative to
the source path specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. This option
is required to make an El Torito bootable CD. The boot image
must be exactly 1200 kB, 1440 kB or 2880 kB, and
<b>genisoimage</b> will use this size when creating the
output ISO9660 filesystem. The PC BIOS will use the image to
emulate a floppy disk, so the first 512-byte sector should
contain PC boot code. This will work, for example, if the
boot image is a LILO-based boot floppy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the boot
image is not an image of a floppy, you need to add either
<b>&minus;hard&minus;disk&minus;boot</b> or
<b>&minus;no&minus;emul&minus;boot</b>. If the system should
not boot off the emulated disk, use
<b>&minus;no&minus;boot</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;sort</b> has not been specified, the boot images
are sorted with low priority (+2) to the beginning of the
medium. If you don&rsquo;t like this, you need to specify a
sort weight of 0 for the boot images.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;eltorito&minus;alt&minus;boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Start with a new set of El
Torito boot parameters. Up to 63 El Torito boot entries may
be stored on a single CD.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hard&minus;disk&minus;boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that the boot image
used to create El Torito bootable CDs is a hard disk image.
The image must begin with a master boot record that contains
a single partition.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;no&minus;emul&minus;boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that the boot image
used to create El Torito bootable CDs is a &quot;no
emulation&quot; image. The system will load and execute this
image without performing any disk emulation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;no&minus;boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that the created El
Torito CD should be marked as not bootable. The system will
provide an emulated drive for the image, but will boot off a
standard boot device.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;boot&minus;load&minus;seg</b>
<i>segment_address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the load segment
address of the boot image for no-emulation El Torito
CDs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;boot&minus;load&minus;size</b>
<i>load_sectors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the number of
&quot;virtual&quot; (512-byte) sectors to load in
no-emulation mode. The default is to load the entire boot
file. Some BIOSes may have problems if this is not a
multiple of 4.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;boot&minus;info&minus;table</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that a 56-byte table
with information of the CD-ROM layout will be patched in at
offset 8 in the boot file. If this option is given, the boot
file is <i>modified in the source filesystem</i>, so make a
copy of this file if it cannot be easily regenerated! See
the <b>EL TORITO BOOT INFO TABLE</b> section for a
description of this table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b>
<i>last_sess_start,next_sess_start</i> <b><br>
&minus;cdrecord&minus;params</b>
<i>last_sess_start,next_sess_start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is needed to create
a CD Extra or the image of a second session or a
higher-level session for a multisession disc.
<b>&minus;C</b> takes two numbers separated by a comma. The
first is the first sector in the last session of the disc
that should be appended to. The second number is the
starting sector number of the new session. The correct
numbers may be retrieved by calling <b>wodim &minus;msinfo
...</b> If <b>&minus;C</b> is used in conjunction with
<b>&minus;M</b>, <b>genisoimage</b> will create a filesystem
image that is intended to be a continuation of the previous
session. If <b>&minus;C</b> is used without <b>&minus;M</b>,
<b>genisoimage</b> will create a filesystem image that is
intended to be used for a second session on a CD Extra. This
is a multisession CD that holds audio data in the first
session and an ISO9660 filesystem in the second session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>
<i>boot_catalog</i> <b><br>
&minus;eltorito&minus;catalog</b> <i>boot_catalog</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot catalog, which is required for an El Torito
bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to <b>genisoimage</b>. This file will be
inserted into the output tree and not created in the source
filesystem, so be sure the specified filename does not
conflict with an existing file, or it will be excluded.
Usually a name like <i>boot.catalog</i> is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;sort</b> has not been specified, the boot catalog
sorted with low priority (+1) to the beginning of the
medium. If you don&rsquo;t like this, you need to specify a
sort weight of 0 for the boot catalog.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;check&minus;oldnames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Check all filenames imported
from the old session for compliance with the ISO9660 file
naming rules. Without this option, only names longer than 31
characters are checked, as these files are a serious
violation of the ISO9660 standard.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;check&minus;session</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Check all old sessions for
compliance with actual <b>genisoimage</b> ISO9660 file
naming rules. This is a high-level option that combines
<b>&minus;M</b> <i>file</i> <b>&minus;C 0,0
&minus;check&minus;oldnames</b>. For the parameter
<i>file</i>, see the description of <b>&minus;M</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;checksum_algorithm_iso</b>
<i>alg1,alg2,...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the checksum types
desired for the output image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;checksum_algorithm_template</b>
<i>alg1,alg2,...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the checksum types
desired for the output jigdo template.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;copyright</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies copyright
information, typically a filename on the disc. There is
space for 37 characters. Equivalent to <b>COPY</b> in the
<i>.genisoimagerc</i> file.</p>

It seems to be impossible to completely hide the
<i>RR_MOVED</i> directory from the Rock Ridge tree. This
option only makes the visible tree less confusing for people
who don&rsquo;t know what this directory is for. If you need
to have no <i>RR_MOVED</i> directory at all, you should use
<b>&minus;D</b>. Note that if <b>&minus;D</b> has been

space reserved for file version numbers. <br>
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work

the client. If any search bit is set for a directory, set
all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client. All write bits are cleared,
because the filesystem will be mounted read-only in any
case. If any of the special mode bits are set, clear them,
because file locks are not useful on a read-only filesystem,
and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or gid 0. When
used on Win32, the execute bit is set on <i>all</i> files.
This is a result of the lack of file permissions on Win32
and the Cygwin POSIX emulation layer. See also
<b>&minus;uid</b>, <b>&minus;gid</b>,

and <b>&minus;new&minus;dir&minus;mode</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;relaxed&minus;filenames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows ISO9660 filenames to
include all 7-bit ASCII characters except lowercase letters.
<br>
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;root</b>
<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Moves all files and directories
into <i>dir</i> in the image. This is essentially the same
as using <b>&minus;graft&minus;points</b> and adding
<i>dir</i> in front of every pathspec, but is easier to use.
<i>dir</i> may actually be several levels deep. It is
created with the same permissions as other graft points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;old-root</b>
<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is necessary when
writing a multisession image and the previous (or even
older) session was written with <b>-root</b> <i>dir</i>.
Using a directory name not found in the previous session
causes <b>genisoimage</b> to abort with an error. Without
this option, <b>genisoimage</b> would not be able to find
unmodified files and would be forced to write their data
into the image once more. <b>&minus;root</b> and
<b>&minus;old-root</b> are meant to be used together to do
incremental backups. The initial session would e.g. use:
<b>genisoimage &minus;root backup_1</b> <i>dirs</i>. The
next incremental backup with <b>genisoimage &minus;root
backup_2 &minus;old-root backup_1</b> <i>dirs</i> would take
another snapshot of these directories. The first snapshot
would be found in <b>backup_1</b>, the second one in
<b>backup_2</b>, but only modified or new files need to be
written into the second session. Without these options, new
files would be added and old ones would be preserved. But
old ones would be overwritten if the file was modified.
Recovering the files by copying the whole directory back
from CD would also restore files that were deleted
intentionally. Accessing several older versions of a file
requires support by the operating system to choose which
sessions are to be mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b> <i>sector
type</i> <b><br>
&minus;sectype</b> <i>sector type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set output sector type to e.g.
data/xa1/raw. <br>
.TP <b>&minus;sort</b> <i>sort_file</i> Sort file locations
on the media. Sorting is controlled by a file that contains
pairs of filenames and sorting offset weighting. If the
weighting is higher, the file will be located closer to the
beginning of the media, if the weighting is lower, the file
will be located closer to the end of the media. There must
be only one space or tabs character between the filename and
the weight and the weight must be the last characters on a
line. The filename is taken to include all the characters up
to, but not including the last space or tab character on a
line. This is to allow for space characters to be in, or at
the end of a filename. This option does <b>not</b> sort the
order of the filenames that appear in the ISO9660 directory.
It sorts the order in which the file data is written to the
CD image, which is useful in order to optimize the data
layout on a CD. See <b>README.sort</b> for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;split&minus;output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Split the output image into
several files of approximately 1 GB each. This helps to
create DVD-sized ISO9660 images on operating systems without
large file support. <b>wodim</b> will concatenate more than
one file into a single track if writing to a DVD. To make
<b>&minus;split&minus;output</b> work, <b>&minus;o</b>
<i>filename</i> must be specified. The resulting output
images will be named: <i>filename_00</i>,
<i>filename_01</i>, <i>filename_02</i>....</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;stream&minus;media&minus;size</b>
<i>#</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select streaming operation and
set the media size to # sectors. This allows you to pipe the
output of the <b>tar</b>(1) program into <b>genisoimage</b>
and to create an ISO9660 filesystem without the need of an
intermediate tar archive file. If this option has been
specified, <b>genisoimage</b> reads from <i>stdin</i> and
creates a file with the name <i>STREAM.IMG</i>. The maximum
size of the file (with padding) is 200 sectors less than the
specified media size. If <b>&minus;no&minus;pad</b> has been
specified, the file size is 50 sectors less than the
specified media size. If the file is smaller,
<b>genisoimage</b> will write padding. This may take
awhile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option
<b>&minus;stream&minus;media&minus;size</b> creates simple
ISO9660 filesystems only and may not used together with
multisession or hybrid filesystem options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;sunx86&minus;boot</b>
<i>UFS_img,,,AUX1_img</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a comma-separated

CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
partition 1 is used for the ISO9660 image and that partition
2 is the whole disk, so partition 1 and 2 may not be used by
external partition data. The first image file is mapped to
partition 0. There may be empty fields in the
comma-separated list, and list entries for partition 1 and 2
must be empty. The maximum number of supported partitions is
8 (although the Solaris x86 partition table could support up
to 16 partitions), so it is impossible to specify more than
6 partition images. This option is required to make a
bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;sunx86&minus;boot</b> has been specified, the
first sector of the resulting image will contain a PC fdisk
label with a Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition that starts
at offset 512 and spans the whole CD. In addition, for the
Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition, there is a SVr4 disk
label at offset 1024 in the first sector of the CD. This
disk label specifies slice 0 for the first (usually UFS
type) filesystem image that is used to boot the PC and slice
1 for the ISO9660 image. Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3
... slice 7 may be used for additional filesystem images
that have been specified with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A Solaris x86
boot CD uses a 1024 byte sized primary boot that uses the
<b>El-Torito no-emulation</b> boot mode and a secondary

<h2>CHARACTER SETS
<a name="CHARACTER SETS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
processes filenames in a POSIX-compliant way as strings of
8-bit characters. To represent all codings for all
languages, 8-bit characters are not sufficient. Unicode or
ISO-10646 define character codings that need at least 21
bits to represent all known languages. They may be
represented with <i>UTF-32</i>, <i>UTF-16</i> or
<i>UTF-8</i> coding. UTF-32 uses a plain 32-bit coding but
seems to be uncommon. UTF-16 is used by Microsoft with Win32
with the disadvantage that 16-bit characters are not
compliant with the POSIX filesystem interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Modern Unix
operating systems may use UTF-8 coding for filenames. Each
32-bit character is represented by one or more 8-bit
characters. If a character is coded in <i>ISO-8859-1</i>
(used in Central Europe and North America) is maps 1:1 to a
UTF-32 or UTF-16 coded Unicode character. If a character is
coded in <i>7-Bit ASCII</i> (used in USA and other countries
with limited character set) is maps 1:1 to a UTF-32, UTF-16
or UTF-8 coded Unicode character. Character codes that
cannot be represented as a single byte in UTF-8 (if the
value is &gt; 0x7F) use escape sequences that map to more
than one 8-bit character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all
operating systems used UTF-8, <b>genisoimage</b> would not
need to recode characters in filenames. Unfortunately, Apple
uses completely nonstandard codings and Microsoft uses a
Unicode coding that is not compatible with the POSIX
filename interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For all
non-UTF-8-coded operating systems, the actual character that
each byte represents depends on the <i>character set</i> or
<i>codepage</i> (the name used by Microsoft) used by the
local operating system &mdash; the characters in a character
set will reflect the region or natural language set by the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually
character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters, codes
0x20-0x7f are the 7-bit ASCII characters and (on PCs and
Macs) 0x80-0xff are used for other characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As there are a
lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use, only a small
subset are represented in a character set. Therefore the
same character code may represent a different character in
different character sets. So a filename generated, say in
central Europe, may not display the same character when
viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make matters
more complicated, different operating systems use different
character sets for the region or language. For example, the
character code for &lsquo;&eacute;&rsquo; (small e with
acute accent) may be character code 0x82 on a PC, code 0x8e
on a Macintosh, code 0xe9 on a Unix system in western
Europe, and code 0x000e9 in Unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As long as not
all operating systems and applications use the same
character set as the basis for filenames, it may be
necessary to specify which character set your filenames use
in and which character set the filenames should appear on
the CD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are four
options to specify the character sets you want to use:
<b><br>
&minus;input&minus;charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the local character set
you are using on your host machine. Any character set
conversions that take place will use this character set as
the starting point. The default input character sets are
<i>cp437</i> on MS-DOS-based systems and <i>iso8859-1</i> on
all other systems. If <b>&minus;J</b> is given, the Unicode
equivalents of the input character set will be used in the
Joliet directory. <b>&minus;jcharset</b> is the same as
<b>&minus;input&minus;charset &minus;J</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;output&minus;charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the character set that
will be used with for the Rock Ridge names on the CD.
Defaults to the input character set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;input&minus;hfs&minus;charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the HFS character set
used for HFS filenames decoded from any of the various
Apple/Unix file formats. Only useful when used with
<b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b>. See the <b>HFS MACINTOSH
FILENAMES</b> for more information. Defaults to
<i>cp10000</i> (Mac Roman).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;output&minus;hfs&minus;charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the HFS character set
used to create HFS filenames from the input character set in
use. In most cases this will be from the character set given
with <b>&minus;input&minus;charset</b>. Defaults to the
input HFS character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of character sets built in to <b>genisoimage</b>. To
get a listing, use <b>&minus;input&minus;charset help</b>.
This list doesn&rsquo;t include the charset derived from the
current locale, if <b>genisoimage</b> is built with
<i>iconv</i> support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
character sets can be read from file for any of the
character set options by giving a filename as the argument
to the options. The given file will only be read if its name
does not match one of the built-in character sets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the character set files is the same as the mapping files
available from
<i>http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS</i>. This format
is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Column #1 is
the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX) <br>
Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX) <br>
The rest of the line is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any blank line,
line without two (or more) columns in the above format or
comments lines (starting with the # character) are ignored
without any warnings. Any missing input code is mapped to
Unicode character 0x0000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that,
while UTF-8 is supported, other Unicode encodings such as
UCS-2/UTF-16 and UCS-4/UTF-32 are not, as POSIX operating
systems cannot handle them natively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A 1:1 character
set mapping can be defined by using the keyword
<i>default</i> as the argument to any of the character set
options. This is the behaviour of old versions of
<b>mkisofs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ISO9660
filenames generated from the input filenames are not
converted from the input character set. The ISO9660
character set is a very limited subset of the ASCII
characters, so any conversion would be pointless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any character
that <b>genisoimage</b> cannot convert will be replaced with
a &lsquo;_&rsquo; character.</p>

<h2>HFS CREATOR/TYPE
<a name="HFS CREATOR/TYPE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Macintosh
file has two properties associated with it which define
which application created the file, the <i>CREATOR</i> and
what data the file contains, the <i>TYPE</i>. Both are
(exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this allows a Macintosh
user to double-click on a file and launch the correct
application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file
can be found by using something like ResEdit (or similar) on
a Macintosh.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The CREATOR and
TYPE information is stored in all the various Apple/Unix
encoded files. For other files it is possible to base the
CREATOR and TYPE on the filename&rsquo;s extension using a
<i>mapping</i> file (with <b>&minus;map</b>) and/or using
the <i>magic number</i> (usually a <i>signature</i> in the
first few bytes) of a file (with <b>&minus;magic</b>). If
both these options are given, their order on the command
line is significant. If <b>&minus;map</b> is given first, a
filename extension match is attempted before a magic number
match. However, if <b>&minus;magic</b> is given first, a
magic number match is attempted before a filename extension
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a mapping or
magic file is not used, or no match is found, the default
CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can be set by using
entries in the <i>.genisoimagerc</i> file or using
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;creator</b> and/or
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;type</b>, otherwise the default CREATOR
and TYPE are <i>Unix</i> and <i>TEXT</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the <i>mapping</i> file is the same <i>afpfile</i> format as
used by <b>aufs</b>. This file has five columns for the
<i>extension</i>, <i>file translation</i>, <i>CREATOR</i>,
<i>TYPE</i> and <i>Comment</i>. Lines starting with the
&lsquo;#&rsquo; character are comment lines and are ignored.
An example file would be like:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-60641.png" alt="Image grohtml-60641.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The first
column <i>EXTN</i> defines the Unix filename extension to be
mapped. The default mapping for any filename extension that
doesn&rsquo;t match is defined with the &lsquo;*&rsquo;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>Xlate</i> column defines the type of text translation
between the Unix and Macintosh file it is ignored by
<b>genisoimage</b>, but is kept to be compatible with
<b>aufs</b>(1). Although <b>genisoimage</b> does not alter
the contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE set as
<i>TEXT</i>, it <i>may</i> be read incorrectly on a
Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the default TYPE
may be <i>????</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>CREATOR</i> and <i>TYPE</i> keywords must be 4 characters
long and enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The comment
field is enclosed in double quotes &mdash; it is ignored by
<b>genisoimage</b>, but is kept to be compatible with
<b>aufs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the <i>magic</i> file is almost identical to the
<b>magic</b>(5) file used by the <b>file</b>(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This file has
four tab-separated columns for the <i>byte offset</i>,
<i>type</i>, <i>test</i> and <i>message</i>. Lines starting
with the &lsquo;#&rsquo; character are comment lines and are
ignored. An example file would be like:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-60642.png" alt="Image grohtml-60642.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the file is described in <b>magic</b>(5). The only
difference here is that for each entry in the magic file,
the <i>message</i> for the initial offset must be be 4
characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the
TYPE &mdash; white space is optional between them. Any other
characters on this line are ignored. Continuation lines
(starting with a &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;) are also ignored, i.e.,
only the initial offset lines are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>&minus;magic</b> may significantly increase processing
time as each file has to opened and read to find its magic
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In summary, for
all files, the default CREATOR is <i>Unix</i> and the
default TYPE is <i>TEXT</i>. These can be changed by using
entries in the <i>.genisoimagerc</i> file or by using
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;creator</b> and/or
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;type</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the a file
is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and the format
has been selected), the CREATOR and TYPE are taken from the
values stored in the Apple/Unix file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other files can
have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their filename
extension (with <b>&minus;map</b>), or their magic number
(with <b>&minus;magic</b>). If the default match is used in
the <i>mapping</i> file, these values override the default
CREATOR and TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A full
CREATOR/TYPE database can be found at
<i>http://www.angelfire.com/il/szekely/</i>.</p>

<h2>HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
<a name="HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Macintosh files
have two parts called the <i>Data</i> and <i>Resource
fork</i>. Either may be empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can
only cope with files having one part (or fork). To add to
this, Macintosh files have a number of attributes associated
with them &mdash; probably the most important are the TYPE
and CREATOR. Again, Unix has no concept of these types of
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">E.g., a
Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is stored
in the Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in the
Resource fork. It is usually the information in the data
fork that is useful across platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore to
store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem, a way has to be
found to cope with the two forks and the extra attributes
(which are referred to as the <i>Finder info</i>).
Unfortunately, it seems that every software package that
stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a completely
different storage method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Apple/Unix
formats that <b>genisoimage</b> (partially) supports are:
<br>
CAP AUFS format</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory <i>.resource</i> with same
filename as data fork. Finder info in subdirectory
<i>.finderinfo</i> with same filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">AppleDouble/Netatalk</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork stored in a file with same name prefixed with
&lsquo;%&rsquo;. Finder info also stored in same
&lsquo;%&rsquo; file. Netatalk uses the same format, but the
resource fork/Finder info stored in subdirectory
<i>.AppleDouble</i> with same filename as data fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">AppleSingle</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data structures similar to
above, except both forks and Finder info are stored in one
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Helios EtherShare</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork and Finder info together in subdirectory
<i>.rsrc</i> with same filename as data fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">IPT UShare</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like the EtherShare format, but
the Finder info is stored slightly differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MacBinary</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Both forks and Finder info
stored in one file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Apple PC Exchange</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by Macintoshes to store
Apple files on DOS (FAT) disks. Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory <i>resource.frk</i> (or
<i>RESOURCE.FRK</i>). Finder info as one record in file
<i>finder.dat</i> (or <i>FINDER.DAT</i>). Separate
<i>finder.dat</i> for each data fork directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note:
<b>genisoimage</b> needs to know the native FAT cluster size
of the disk that the PC Exchange files are on (or have been
copied from). This size is given by
<b>&minus;cluster&minus;size</b>. The cluster or allocation
size can be found by using the DOS utility
<b>chkdsk</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">May not work
with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS
8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be
mounted as type <i>msdos</i> (not <i>vfat</i>) when using
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SGI/XINET</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by SGI machines when they
mount HFS disks. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork
in subdirectory <i>.HSResource</i> with same filename.
Finder info as one record in file <i>.HSancillary</i>.
Separate <i>.HSancillary</i> for each data fork
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thursby Software Systems
DAVE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows Macintoshes to store
Apple files on SMB servers. Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory <i>resource.frk</i>. Uses the
AppleDouble format to store resource fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Services for Macintosh</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Format of files stored by NT
Servers on NTFS filesystems. Data fork is stored as
<i>filename</i>. Resource fork stored as a NTFS stream
called <i>filename:AFP_Resource</i>. The Finder info is
stored as a NTFS stream called <i>filename:Afp_AfpInfo</i>.
NTFS streams are normally invisible to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Warning:
<b>genisoimage</b> only partially supports the SFM format.
If an HFS file or folder stored on the NT server contains an
illegal NT character in its name, NT converts these
characters to <i>Private Use Unicode</i> characters. The
characters are: &quot; * / &lt; &gt; ? \ | and a space or
period if it is the last character of the filename,
character codes 0x01 to 0x1f (control characters) and
Apple&rsquo;s apple logo.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
these private Unicode characters are not readable by the
<b>genisoimage</b> NT executable. Therefore any file or
directory name containing these characters will be ignored
&mdash; including the contents of any such directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Mac OS X AppleDouble</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When HFS/HFS+ files are copied
or saved by Mac OS X on to a non-HFS filesystem (e.g. UFS,
NFS etc.), the files are stored in AppleDouble format. Data
fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with &lsquo;._&rsquo;. Finder info also
stored in same &lsquo;._&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Mac OS X HFS (Alpha)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Not really an Apple/Unix
encoding, but actual HFS/HFS+ files on a Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X
system. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in
a pseudo file with the same name with the suffix
<i>/rsrc</i>. The Finder info is only available via a Mac OS
X library call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">See also
<i>README.macosx</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Only works when
used on Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a file is
found with a zero length resource fork and empty finderinfo,
it is assumed not to have any Apple/Unix encoding &mdash;
therefore a TYPE and CREATOR can be set using other
methods.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and possibly
other flags from the finder info. Additionally, if it
exists, the Macintosh filename is set from the finder info,
otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix filename
&mdash; see the <b>HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES</b> section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<b>&minus;apple</b>, the TYPE and CREATOR are stored in the
optional System Use or <i>SUSP</i> field in the ISO9660
Directory Record &mdash; in much the same way as the Rock
Ridge attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple
extensions are added at the beginning of the existing Rock
Ridge attributes (i.e., to get the Apple extensions you get
the Rock Ridge extensions as well).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Apple
extensions require the resource fork to be stored as an
ISO9660 <i>associated</i> file. This is just like any normal
file stored in the ISO9660 filesystem except that the
associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit 2).
This file has the same name as the data fork (the file seen
by non-Apple machines). Associated files are normally
ignored by other OSs</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<b>&minus;hfs</b>, the TYPE and CREATOR plus other finder
info, are stored in a separate HFS directory, not visible on
the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory references the same
data and resource fork files described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
it is better to use <b>&minus;hfs</b> instead of
<b>&minus;apple</b>, as the latter imposes the limited
ISO9660 characters allowed in filenames. However, the Apple
extensions do give the advantage that the files are packed
on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible to fit
more files on a CD.</p>

<h2>HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES
<a name="HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where possible,
the HFS filename that is stored with an Apple/Unix file is
used for the HFS part of the CD. However, not all the
Apple/Unix encodings store the HFS filename with the
finderinfo. In these cases, the Unix filename is used
&mdash; with escaped special characters. Special characters
include &lsquo;/&rsquo; and characters with codes over
127.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AUFS escapes
these characters by using &lsquo;:&rsquo; followed by the
character code as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
have a similar scheme, but uses &lsquo;%&rsquo; instead of a
&lsquo;:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>genisoimage</b> cannot find an HFS filename, it uses the
Unix name, with any <i>%xx</i> or <i>:xx</i> characters
(<i>xx</i> are two hex digits) converted to a single
character code. If <i>xx</i> are not hex digits
([0-9a-fA-F]), they are left alone &mdash; although any
remaining &lsquo;:&rsquo; is converted to &lsquo;%&rsquo;,
as &lsquo;:&rsquo; is the HFS directory separator. Care must
be taken, as an ordinary Unix file with <i>%xx</i> or
<i>:xx</i> will also be converted. e.g.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-60643.png" alt="Image grohtml-60643.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although HFS
filenames appear to support uppercase and lowercase letters,
the filesystem is case-insensitive, i.e., the filenames
<i>aBc</i> and <i>AbC</i> are the same. If a file is found
in a directory with the same HFS name, <b>genisoimage</b>
will attempt to make a unique name by adding &lsquo;_&rsquo;
characters to one of the filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an HFS
filename exists for a file, <b>genisoimage</b> can use this
name as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and Rock
Ridge filenames using <b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b>. Normal
Unix files without an HFS name will still use their Unix
name. e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a MacBinary
(or PC Exchange) file is stored as <i>someimage.gif.bin</i>
on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS file called
<i>someimage.gif</i>, this is the name that would appear on
the HFS part of the CD. However, as <b>genisoimage</b> uses
the Unix name as the starting point for the other names, the
ISO9660 name generated will probably be <i>SOMEIMAG.BIN</i>
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be <i>someimage.gif.bin</i>.
This option will use the HFS filename as the starting point
and the ISO9660 name will probably be <i>SOMEIMAG.GIF</i>
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be <i>someimage.gif</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b>
will not currently work with <b>&minus;T</b> &mdash; the
Unix name will be used in the <i>TRANS.TBL</i> file, not the
Macintosh name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The character
set used to convert any HFS filename to a Joliet/Rock Ridge
filename defaults to <i>cp10000</i> (Mac Roman). The
character set used can be specified using
<b>&minus;input&minus;hfs&minus;charset</b>. Other built-in
HFS character sets are: <i>cp10006</i> (MacGreek),
<i>cp10007</i> (MacCyrillic), <i>cp10029</i> (MacLatin2),
<i>cp10079</i> (MacIcelandandic) and <i>cp10081</i>
(MacTurkish).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: the
character codes used by HFS filenames taken from the various
Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as they are assumed
to be in the correct Apple character set. Only the
Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from the HFS filenames will
be converted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The existing
<b>genisoimage</b> code will filter out any illegal
characters for the ISO9660 and Joliet filenames, but as
<b>genisoimage</b> expects to be dealing directly with Unix
names, it leaves the Rock Ridge names as is. But as
&lsquo;/&rsquo; is a legal HFS filename character,
<b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b> converts &lsquo;/&rsquo; to a
&lsquo;_&rsquo; in Rock Ridge filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the Apple
extensions are used, only the ISO9660 filenames will appear
on the Macintosh. However, as the Macintosh ISO9660 drivers
can use <i>Level 2</i> filenames, you can use options like
<b>&minus;allow&minus;multidot</b> without problems on a
Macintosh &mdash; still take care over the names, for
example <i>this.file.name</i> will be converted to
<i>THIS.FILE</i> i.e. only have one &lsquo;.&rsquo;, also
filename <i>abcdefgh</i> will be seen as <i>ABCDEFGH</i> but
<i>abcdefghi</i> will be seen as <i>ABCDEFGHI.</i> i.e. with
a &lsquo;.&rsquo; at the end &mdash; don&rsquo;t know if
this is a Macintosh problem or a
<b>genisoimage</b>/<b>mkhybrid</b> problem. All filenames
will be in uppercase when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course,
DOS/Win3.X machines will not be able to see Level 2
filenames...</p>

<h2>HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS
<a name="HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To give a HFS
CD a custom icon, make sure the root (top level) folder
includes a standard Macintosh volume icon file. To give a
volume a custom icon on a Macintosh, an icon has to be
pasted over the volume&rsquo;s icon in the &quot;Get
Info&quot; box of the volume. This creates an invisible file
called <i>Icon\r</i> (&lsquo;\r&rsquo; is the carriage
return character) in the root folder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A custom folder
icon is very similar &mdash; an invisible file called
<i>Icon\r</i> exists in the folder itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Probably the
easiest way to create a custom icon that <b>genisoimage</b>
can use is to format a blank HFS floppy disk on a Mac and
paste an icon to its &quot;Get Info&quot; box. If using
Linux with the HFS module installed, mount the floppy:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">mount &minus;t
hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The floppy will
be mounted as a CAP filesystem by default. Then run
<b>genisoimage</b> using something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">genisoimage
&minus;&minus;cap &minus;o output source_dir /mnt/floppy</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are not
using Linux, you can use <b>hfsutils</b> to copy the icon
file from the floppy. However, care has to be taken, as the
icon file contains a control character. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">hmount /dev/fd0
<br>
hdir &minus;a <br>
hcopy &minus;m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
&lsquo;^V^M&rsquo; is control-V followed by control-M. Then
run <b>genisoimage</b> by using something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">genisoimage
&minus;&minus;macbin &minus;o output source_dir icon_dir</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The procedure
for creating/using custom folder icons is very similar
&mdash; paste an icon to folder&rsquo;s &quot;Get Info&quot;
box and transfer the resulting <i>Icon\r</i> file to the
relevant directory in the <b>genisoimage</b> source
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may want to
hide the icon files from the ISO9660 and Joliet trees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To give a
custom icon to a Joliet CD, follow the instructions found at
<i>http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq03.html#S3-21-1</i>.</p>

<h2>HFS BOOT DRIVER
<a name="HFS BOOT DRIVER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It <i>may</i>
be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a
Macintosh.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A bootable HFS
CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a
bootable HFS partition and the necessary System, Finder,
etc. files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A driver can be
obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the
<b>apple_driver</b> utility. This file can then be used with
<b>&minus;boot&minus;hfs&minus;file</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The HFS
partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a
suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM or
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a partition
to be bootable, it must have its <i>boot block</i> set. The
boot block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a
non-bootable partition the boot block is full of zeros.
Normally, when a System file is copied to partition on a
Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of
required settings &mdash; unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know
the full spec for the boot block, so I&rsquo;m guessing that
the following will work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore, the
utility <b>apple_driver</b> also extracts the boot block
from the first HFS partition it finds on the given CD-ROM
and this is used for the HFS partition created by
<b>genisoimage</b>.</p>

<h2>HPPA NOTES
<a name="HPPA NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make a
bootable CD for HPPA, at the very least a boot loader file
(<b>&minus;hppa&minus;bootloader</b>), a kernel image file
(32-bit, 64-bit, or both, depending on hardware) and a boot
command line (<b>&minus;hppa&minus;cmdline</b>) must be
specified. Some systems can boot either a 32- or a 64-bit
kernel, and the firmware will choose one if both are
present. Optionally, a ramdisk can be used for the root
filesystem using <b>&minus;hppa&minus;cmdline</b>.</p>

<h2>JIGDO NOTES
<a name="JIGDO NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jigdo is a tool
to help in the distribution of large files like CD and DVD
images; see <i>http://atterer.org/jigdo/</i> for more
details. Debian CDs and DVD ISO images are published on the
web in jigdo format to allow end users to download them more
efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create jigdo
and template files alongside the ISO image from
<b>genisoimage</b>, you must first generate a list of the
files that will be used, in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">MD5sum File
size Path <br>
32 chars 12 chars to end of line</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The MD5sum must
be written in standard hexadecimal notation, the file size
must list the size of the file in bytes, and the path must
list the absolute path to the file. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">00006dcd58ff0756c36d2efae21be376
14736 /mirror/debian/file1 <br>
000635c69b254a1be8badcec3a8d05c1 211822 /mirror/debian/file2
<br>
00083436a3899a09633fc1026ef1e66e 22762
/mirror/debian/file3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you have
this file, call <b>genisoimage</b> with all of your normal
command-line parameters. Specify the output filenames for
the jigdo and template files using
<b>&minus;jigdo&minus;jigdo</b> and
<b>&minus;jigdo&minus;template</b>, and pass in the location
of your MD5 list with <b>&minus;md5&minus;list</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
files that you do NOT want to be added into the jigdo file
(e.g. if they are likely to change often), specify them
using &minus;jigdo&minus;exclude. If you want to verify some
of the files as they are written into the image, specify
them using &minus;jigdo&minus;force&minus;md5. If any files
don&rsquo;t match, <b>genisoimage</b> will then abort. Both
of these options take regular expressions as input. It is
possible to restrict the set of files that will be used
further based on size &mdash; use the
&minus;jigdo&minus;min&minus;file&minus;size option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
jigdo code needs to know how to map the files it is given
onto a mirror-style configuration. Specify how to map paths
using <b>&minus;jigdo&minus;map</b>. Using
<i>Debian=/mirror/debian</i> will cause all paths starting
with <i>/mirror/debian</i> to be mapped to
<i>Debian:&lt;file&gt;</i> in the output jigdo file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
may safely be installed suid root. This may be needed to
allow <b>genisoimage</b> to read the previous session when
creating a multisession image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>genisoimage</b> is creating a filesystem image with Rock
Ridge attributes and the directory nesting level of the

<b>genisoimage</b> will do deep directory relocation. This
results in a directory called <b>RR_MOVED</b> in the root
directory of the CD. You cannot avoid this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many boot code
options for different platforms are mutualy exclusive
because the boot blocks cannot coexist, ie. different

<h2>HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS
<a name="HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I have had to
make several assumptions on how I expect the modified libhfs
routines to work, however there may be situations that
either I haven&rsquo;t thought of, or come across when these
assumptions fail. Therefore I can&rsquo;t guarantee that
<b>genisoimage</b> will work as expected (although I
haven&rsquo;t had a major problem yet). Most of the HFS
features work fine, but some are not fully tested. These are
marked as <i>Alpha</i> above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although HFS
filenames appear to support uppercase and lowercase letters,
the filesystem is case-insensitive, i.e., the filenames
<i>aBc</i> and <i>AbC</i> are the same. If a file is found
in a directory with the same HFS name, <b>genisoimage</b>
will attempt to make a unique name by adding &lsquo;_&rsquo;
characters to one of the filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HFS
file/directory names that share the first 31 characters have
&lsquo;_N&rsquo; (a decimal number) substituted for the last
few characters to generate unique names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Care must be
taken when &quot;grafting&quot; Apple/Unix files or
directories (see above for the method and syntax involved).
It is not possible to use a new name for an Apple/Unix
encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix encoded file
called <i>oldname</i> is to added to the CD, you cannot use
the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">genisoimage
&minus;o output.raw &minus;hfs &minus;graft&minus;points
newname=oldname cd_dir</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
will be unable to decode <i>oldname</i>. However, you can
graft Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you
do not attempt to give them new names as above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When creating
an HFS volume with the multisession options, <b>&minus;M</b>
and <b>&minus;C</b>, only files in the last session will be
in the HFS volume. i.e. <b>genisoimage</b> cannot <i>add</i>
existing files from previous sessions to the HFS volume.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if
each session is created with <b>&minus;part</b>, each
session will appear as separate volumes when mounted on a
Mac. In this case, it is worth using <b>&minus;V</b> or
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;volid</b> to give each session a unique
volume name, otherwise each &quot;volume&quot; will appear
on the Desktop with the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbolic links
(as with all other non-regular files) are not added to the
HFS directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hybrid volumes
may be larger than pure ISO9660 volumes containing the same
data. In some cases (e.g. DVD sized volumes) the difference
can be significant. As an HFS volume gets bigger, so does
the allocation block size (the smallest amount of space a
file can occupy). For a 650MB CD, the allocation block is
10kB, for a 4.7GB DVD it will be about 70kB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The maximum
number of files in an HFS volume is about 65500 &mdash;
although the real limit will be somewhat less than this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resulting
hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix machine by using the
hfsutils routines. However, no changes can be made to the
volume as it is set as <b>locked.</b> The option
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;unlock</b> will create an output image
that is unlocked &mdash; however no changes should be made
to the contents of the volume (unless you really know what
you are doing) as it&rsquo;s not a &quot;real&quot; HFS
volume.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b>
will not currently work with <b>&minus;T</b> &mdash; the
Unix name will be used in the <i>TRANS.TBL</i> file, not the
Macintosh name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
<b>genisoimage</b> does not alter the contents of a file, if
a binary file has its TYPE set as <i>TEXT</i>, it <i>may</i>
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better
choice for the default TYPE may be <i>????</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;mac&minus;boot&minus;file</b>
may not work at all...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">May not work
with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS
8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be
mounted as type <b>msdos</b> (not <b>vfat</b>) when using
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SFM format
is only partially supported &mdash; see <b>HFS MACINTOSH
FILE FORMATS</b> section above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to use <b>&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b> or
<b>&minus;generic&minus;boot</b> with
<b>&minus;boot&minus;hfs&minus;file</b> or
<b>&minus;prep&minus;boot</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
should be able to create HFS hybrid images over 4Gb,
although this has not been fully tested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>genisoimage</b>
is derived from <b>mkisofs</b> from the <b>cdrtools
2.01.01a08</b> package from May 2006 (with few updates
extracted from cdrtools 2.01.01a24 from March 2007) from .IR
http://cdrecord.berlios.de/ , but is now part of the
<b>cdrkit</b> suite, maintained by Joerg Jaspert, Eduard
Bloch, Steve McIntyre, Peter Samuelson, Christian Fromme,
Ben Hutchings, and other contributors. The maintainers can

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Eric Youngdale
wrote the first versions (1993&ndash;1998) of
<b>mkisofs</b>. J&ouml;rg Schilling wrote the SCSI transport
library and its interface, and has maintained <b>mkisofs</b>
since 1999. James Pearson wrote the HFS hybrid code, using
<i>libhfs</i> by Robert Leslie. Pearson, Schilling, Jungshik
Shin and Jaakko Heinonen contributed to the character set
conversion code. The <b>cdrkit</b> maintainers have
maintained <b>genisoimage</b> since 2006.</p>
