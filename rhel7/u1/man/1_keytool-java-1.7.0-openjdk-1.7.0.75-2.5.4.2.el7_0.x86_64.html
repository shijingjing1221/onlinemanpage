Key and Certificate Management Tool</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manages a

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
[ commands ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The keytool
command interface has changed in Java SE 6. See the Changes
Section for a detailed description. Note that previously
defined commands are still supported.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
is a key and certificate management utility. It allows users
to administer their own public/private key pairs and
associated certificates for use in self&minus;authentication
(where the user authenticates himself/herself to other
users/services) or data integrity and authentication
services, using digital signatures. It also allows users to
cache the public keys (in the form of certificates) of their
communicating peers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>certificate</i> is a digitally signed statement from one
entity (person, company, etc.), saying that the public key
(and some other information) of some other entity has a
particular value. (See Certificates.) When data is digitally
signed, the signature can be verified to check the data
integrity and authenticity. <i>Integrity</i> means that the
data has not been modified or tampered with, and
<i>authenticity</i> means the data indeed comes from whoever
claims to have created and signed it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
also enables users to administer secret keys used in
symmetric encryption/decryption (e.g. DES).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
stores the keys and certificates in a <i>keystore</i>.</p>

<h2>COMMAND AND OPTION NOTES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The various
commands and their options are listed and described below.

<p>Braces surrounding an option generally signify that a
default value will be used if the option is not specified on
the command line. Braces are also used around the
<i>&minus;v</i>, <i>&minus;rfc</i>, and <i>&minus;J</i>

<p>Brackets surrounding an option signify that the user is
prompted for the value(s) if the option is not specified on
the command line. (For a <i>&minus;keypass</i> option, if
you do not specify the option on the command line,
<b>keytool</b> will first attempt to use the keystore
password to recover the private/secret key, and if this

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#AppA
for a full list of <i>&minus;keyalg</i> and
<i>&minus;sigalg</i> you can choose from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Common
Options</b> <br>
The <i>&minus;v</i> option can appear for all commands
except <i>&minus;help</i>. If it appears, it signifies
&quot;verbose&quot; mode; more information will be provided
in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
<i>&minus;Jjavaoption</i> option that may appear for any
command. If it appears, the specified <i>javaoption</i>
string is passed through directly to the Java interpreter.
This option should not contain any spaces. It is useful for
adjusting the execution environment or memory usage. For a
list of possible interpreter options, type <i>java
&minus;h</i> or <i>java &minus;X</i> at the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
may appear for all commands operating on a keystore:</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">&minus;storetype storetype</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">This qualifier
specifies the type of keystore to be instantiated. <br>
&minus;keystore keystore</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The keystore
location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">If the JKS
storetype is used and a keystore file does not yet exist,
then certain <b>keytool</b> commands may result in a new
keystore file being created. For example, if <i>keytool
&minus;genkeypair</i> is invoked and the
<i>&minus;keystore</i> option is not specified, the default
keystore file named <i>.keystore</i> in the user&rsquo;s
home directory will be created if it does not already exist.
Similarly, if the <i>&minus;keystore ks_file</i> option is
specified but <i>ks_file</i> does not exist, then it will be
created</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
input stream from the <i>&minus;keystore</i> option is
passed to the <i>KeyStore.load</i> method. If <i>NONE</i> is
specified as the URL, then a null stream is passed to the
<i>KeyStore.load</i> method. <i>NONE</i> should be specified
if the <i>KeyStore</i> is not file&minus;based (for example,
if it resides on a hardware token device). <br>
&minus;storepass[:env|:file] argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The password
which is used to protect the integrity of the keystore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">If the modifier
<i>env</i> or <i>file</i> is not specified, then the
password has the value <i>argument</i>, which must be at
least 6 characters long. Otherwise, the password is
retrieved as follows:</p>

<p><i>file</i>: Retrieve the password from the file named
<i>argument</i></p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>:
All other options that require passwords, such as
<i>&minus;keypass</i>, <i>&minus;srckeypass</i>,
<i>&minus;destkeypass &minus;srcstorepass</i>, and
<i>&minus;deststorepass</i>, accept the <i>env</i> and
<i>file</i> modifiers. (Remember to separate the password
option and the modifier with a colon, (<i>:</i>).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The password
must be provided to all commands that access the keystore
contents. For such commands, if a <i>&minus;storepass</i>
option is not provided at the command line, the user is
prompted for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">When retrieving
information from the keystore, the password is optional; if
no password is given, the integrity of the retrieved
information cannot be checked and a warning is displayed.
<br>
&minus;providerName provider_name</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Used to
identify a cryptographic service provider&rsquo;s name when
listed in the security properties file. <br>
&minus;providerClass provider_class_name</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Used to specify
the name of cryptographic service provider&rsquo;s master
class file when the service provider is not listed in the
security properties file. <br>
&minus;providerArg provider_arg</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Used in
conjunction with <i>&minus;providerClass</i>. Represents an
optional string input argument for the constructor of
<i>provider_class_name</i>. <br>
&minus;protected</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Either
<i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. This value should be specified
as <i>true</i> if a password must be given via a protected
authentication path such as a dedicated PIN reader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Note: Since
there are two keystores involved in
<i>&minus;importkeystore</i> command, two options, namely,
<i>&minus;srcprotected</i> and <i>&minus;destprotected</i>
are provided for the source keystore and the destination
keystore respectively. <br>
&minus;ext {name{:critical}{=value}}</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Denotes an
X.509 certificate extension. The option can be used in
&minus;genkeypair and &minus;gencert to embed extensions
into the certificate generated, or in <i>&minus;certreq</i>
to show what extensions are requested in the certificate
request. The option can appear multiple times. name can be a
supported extension name (see below) or an arbitrary OID
number. value, if provided, denotes the parameter for the
extension; if omitted, denotes the default value (if
defined) of the extension or the extension requires no
parameter. The <i>:critical</i> modifier, if provided, means
the extension&rsquo;s isCritical attribute is true;
otherwise, false. You may use <i>:c</i> in place of
<i>:critical</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently
keytool supports these named extensions
(case&minus;insensitive):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For name as
OID, value is the HEX dumped DER encoding of the extnValue
for the extension excluding the OCTET STRING type and length
bytes. Any extra character other than standard HEX numbers
(0&minus;9, a&minus;f, A&minus;F) are ignored in the HEX
string. Therefore, both <i>&quot;01:02:03:04&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;01020304&quot;</i> are accepted as identical
values. If there is no value, the extension has an empty
value field then.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A special name
<i>&rsquo;honored&rsquo;</i>, used in <i>&minus;gencert</i>
only, denotes how the extensions included in the certificate
request should be honored. The value for this name is a
comma separated list of <i>&quot;all&quot;</i> (all
requested extensions are honored),
<i>&quot;name{:[critical|non&minus;critical]}&quot;</i> (the
named extension is honored, but using a different isCritical
attribute) and <i>&quot;&minus;name&quot;</i> (used with
all, denotes an exception). Requested extensions are not
honored by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If, besides the
&minus;ext honored option, another named or OID &minus;ext
option is provided, this extension will be added to those
already honored. However, if this name (or OID) also appears
in the honored value, its value and criticality overrides
the one in the request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
subjectKeyIdentifier extension is always created. For non
self&minus;signed certificates, the authorityKeyIdentifier
is always created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b>
Users should be aware that some combinations of extensions
(and other certificate fields) may not conform to the
Internet standard. See Warning Regarding Certificate
Conformance for details.</p>

(&quot;+&quot;) means shifting forward, and the minus sign
(&quot;&minus;&quot;) means shifting backward. The time to
be shifted is <i>nnn</i> units of years, months, days,
hours, minutes, or seconds (denoted by a single character of
&quot;y&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;H&quot;,
&quot;M&quot;, or &quot;S&quot; respectively). The exact
value of the issue time is calculated using the
<i>java.util.GregorianCalendar.add(int field, int
amount)</i> method on each sub value, from left to right.
For example, by specifying <i>&quot;&minus;startdate
&minus;1y+1m&minus;1d&quot;</i>, the issue time will be:
<b><br>
Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(); <br>
c.add(Calendar.YEAR, &minus;1); <br>
c.add(Calendar.MONTH, 1); <br>
c.add(Calendar.DATE, &minus;1); <br>
return c.getTime()</b></p>

form, the user sets the exact issue time in two parts,
year/month/day and hour:minute:second (using the local time
zone). The user may provide only one part, which means the
other part is the same as the current date (or time). User
must provide the exact number of digits as shown in the
format definition (padding with 0 if shorter). When both the
date and time are provided, there is one (and only one)
space character between the two parts. The hour should
always be provided in 24 hour format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
creates the keystore named &quot;mykeystore&quot; in the
&quot;working&quot; directory (assuming it doesn&rsquo;t
already exist), and assigns it the password specified by
<i>&lt;new password for keystore&gt;</i>. It generates a
public/private key pair for the entity whose
&quot;distinguished name&quot; has a common name of
&quot;Mark Jones&quot;, organizational unit of
&quot;Java&quot;, organization of &quot;Oracle&quot; and
two&minus;letter country code of &quot;US&quot;. It uses the
default &quot;DSA&quot; key generation algorithm to create
the keys, both 1024 bits long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It creates a
self&minus;signed certificate (using the default
&quot;SHA1withDSA&quot; signature algorithm) that includes
the public key and the distinguished name information. This
certificate will be valid for 180 days, and is associated
with the private key in a keystore entry referred to by the
alias &quot;business&quot;. The private key is assigned the
password specified by <i>&lt;new password for private
key&gt;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
could be significantly shorter if option defaults were
accepted. As a matter of fact, no options are required;
defaults are used for unspecified options that have default
values, and you are prompted for any required values. Thus,
you could simply have the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;genkeypair</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case, a
keystore entry with alias &quot;mykey&quot; is created, with
a newly&minus;generated key pair and a certificate that is
valid for 90 days. This entry is placed in the keystore
named &quot;.keystore&quot; in your home directory. (The
keystore is created if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist.) You
will be prompted for the distinguished name information, the
keystore password, and the private key password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rest of the
examples assume you executed the <i>&minus;genkeypair</i>
command without options specified, and that you responded to
the prompts with values equal to those given in the first
<i>&minus;genkeypair</i> command, above (for example, a
distinguished name of &quot;cn=Mark Jones, ou=Java,
o=Oracle, c=US&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requesting a
Signed Certificate from a Certification Authority</b> <br>
So far all we&rsquo;ve got is a self&minus;signed
certificate. A certificate is more likely to be trusted by
others if it is signed by a Certification Authority (CA). To
get such a signature, you first generate a Certificate
Signing Request (CSR), via the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;certreq &minus;file MarkJ.csr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
CSR (for the entity identified by the default alias
&quot;mykey&quot;) and puts the request in the file named
&quot;MarkJ.csr&quot;. Submit this file to a CA, such as
VeriSign, Inc. The CA will authenticate you, the requestor
(usually off&minus;line), and then will return a
certificate, signed by them, authenticating your public key.
(In some cases, they will actually return a chain of
certificates, each one authenticating the public key of the
signer of the previous certificate in the chain.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Importing a
Certificate for the CA</b> <br>
You need to replace your self&minus;signed certificate with
a certificate chain, where each certificate in the chain
authenticates the public key of the signer of the previous
certificate in the chain, up to a &quot;root&quot; CA.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you
import the certificate reply from a CA, you need one or more
&quot;trusted certificates&quot; in your keystore or in the
<i>cacerts</i> keystore file (which is described in
importcert command):</p>

<td width="15%"></td>

<p>If the certificate reply is a single certificate, you
need a certificate for the issuing CA (the one that signed
it), and if that certificate is not self&minus;signed, you
need a certificate for its signer, and so on, up to a
self&minus;signed &quot;root&quot; CA certificate.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file ships with several
VeriSign root CA certificates, so you probably won&rsquo;t
need to import a VeriSign certificate as a trusted
certificate in your keystore. But if you request a signed
certificate from a different CA, and a certificate
authenticating that CA&rsquo;s public key hasn&rsquo;t been
added to &quot;cacerts&quot;, you will need to import a
certificate from the CA as a &quot;trusted
certificate&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A certificate
from a CA is usually either self&minus;signed, or signed by
another CA (in which case you also need a certificate
authenticating that CA&rsquo;s public key). Suppose company
ABC, Inc., is a CA, and you obtain a file named
&quot;ABCCA.cer&quot; that is purportedly a
self&minus;signed certificate from ABC, authenticating that
CA&rsquo;s public key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be very careful
to ensure the certificate is valid prior to importing it as
a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate! View it first (using the
<b>keytool</b> <i>&minus;printcert</i> command, or the
<b>keytool</b> <i>&minus;importcert</i> command without the
<i>&minus;noprompt</i> option), and make sure that the
displayed certificate fingerprint(s) match the expected
ones. You can call the person who sent the certificate, and
compare the fingerprint(s) that you see with the ones that
they show (or that a secure public key repository shows).
Only if the fingerprints are equal is it guaranteed that the
certificate has not been replaced in transit with somebody
else&rsquo;s (for example, an attacker&rsquo;s) certificate.
If such an attack took place, and you did not check the
certificate before you imported it, you would end up
trusting anything the attacker has signed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you trust
that the certificate is valid, then you can add it to your
keystore via the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;importcert &minus;alias abc &minus;file
ABCCA.cer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
&quot;trusted certificate&quot; entry in the keystore, with
the data from the file &quot;ABCCA.cer&quot;, and assigns
the alias &quot;abc&quot; to the entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Importing
the Certificate Reply from the CA</b> <br>
Once you&rsquo;ve imported a certificate authenticating the
public key of the CA you submitted your certificate signing
request to (or there is already such a certificate in the
&quot;cacerts&quot; file), you can import the certificate
reply and thereby replace your self&minus;signed certificate
with a certificate chain. This chain is the one returned by
the CA in response to your request (if the CA reply is a
chain), or one constructed (if the CA reply is a single
certificate) using the certificate reply and trusted
certificates that are already available in the keystore
where you import the reply or in the &quot;cacerts&quot;
keystore file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
suppose you sent your certificate signing request to
VeriSign. You can then import the reply via the following,
which assumes the returned certificate is named
&quot;VSMarkJ.cer&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;importcert &minus;trustcacerts &minus;file
VSMarkJ.cer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exporting a
Certificate Authenticating Your Public Key</b> <br>
Suppose you have used the jarsigner(1) tool to sign a Java
ARchive (JAR) file. Clients that want to use the file will
want to authenticate your signature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One way they
can do this is by first importing your public key
certificate into their keystore as a &quot;trusted&quot;
entry. You can export the certificate and supply it to your
clients. As an example, you can copy your certificate to a
file named <i>MJ.cer</i> via the following, assuming the
entry is aliased by &quot;mykey&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;exportcert &minus;alias mykey &minus;file
MJ.cer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given that
certificate, and the signed JAR file, a client can use the
<b>jarsigner</b> tool to authenticate your signature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Importing
Keystore</b> <br>
The command &quot;importkeystore&quot; is used to import an
entire keystore into another keystore, which means all
entries from the source keystore, including keys and
certificates, are all imported to the destination keystore
within a single command. You can use this command to import
entries from a different type of keystore. During the
import, all new entries in the destination keystore will
have the same alias names and protection passwords (for
secret keys and private keys). If <b>keytool</b> has
difficulties recover the private keys or secret keys from
the source keystore, it will prompt you for a password. If
it detects alias duplication, it will ask you for a new one,
you can specify a new alias or simply allow <b>keytool</b>
to overwrite the existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
import entries from a normal JKS type keystore key.jks into
a PKCS #11 type hardware based keystore, you can use the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;importkeystore <br>
&minus;srckeystore key.jks &minus;destkeystore NONE <br>
&minus;srcstoretype JKS &minus;deststoretype PKCS11 <br>
&minus;srcstorepass</b> <b><i>&lt;source keystore
password&gt;</i></b> <b>&minus;deststorepass</b>
<b><i>&lt;destination keystore password&gt;</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
importkeystore command can also be used to import a single
entry from a source keystore to a destination keystore. In
this case, besides the options you see in the above example,
you need to specify the alias you want to import. With the
srcalias option given, you can also specify the destination
alias name in the command line, as well as protection
password for a secret/private key and the destination
protection password you want. The following command
demonstrates this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool
&minus;importkeystore <br>
&minus;srckeystore key.jks &minus;destkeystore NONE <br>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">An alias is
specified when you add an entity to the keystore using the
&minus;genseckey command to generate a secret key,
&minus;genkeypair command to generate a key pair (public and
private key) or the &minus;importcert command to add a
certificate or certificate chain to the list of trusted

this same alias to refer to the entity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">For example,

Implementation</b></p> </td>
<td width="46%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>KeyStore</i> class provided in the <i>java.security</i>
package supplies well&minus;defined interfaces to access and
modify the information in a keystore. It is possible for
there to be multiple different concrete implementations,
where each implementation is that for a particular
<i>type</i> of keystore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, two
command&minus;line tools (<b>keytool</b> and
<b>jarsigner</b>) and a GUI&minus;based tool named <b>Policy
Tool</b> make use of keystore implementations. Since
<i>KeyStore</i> is publicly available, users can write
additional security applications that use it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
built&minus;in default implementation, provided by Oracle.
It implements the keystore as a file, utilizing a
proprietary keystore type (format) named &quot;JKS&quot;. It
protects each private key with its individual password, and
also protects the integrity of the entire keystore with a
(possibly different) password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Keystore
implementations are provider&minus;based. More specifically,
the application interfaces supplied by <i>KeyStore</i> are
implemented in terms of a &quot;Service Provider
Interface&quot; (SPI). That is, there is a corresponding
abstract <i>KeystoreSpi</i> class, also in the
<i>java.security</i> package, which defines the Service
Provider Interface methods that &quot;providers&quot; must
implement. (The term &quot;provider&quot; refers to a
package or a set of packages that supply a concrete
implementation of a subset of services that can be accessed
by the Java Security API.) Thus, to provide a keystore
implementation, clients must implement a
&quot;provider&quot; and supply a KeystoreSpi subclass
implementation, as described in <i>How to Implement a
Provider for the Java Cryptography Architecture</i> @ <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/HowToImplAProvider.html.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
can choose different <i>types</i> of keystore
implementations from different providers, using the
&quot;getInstance&quot; factory method supplied in the
<i>KeyStore</i> class. A keystore type defines the storage
and data format of the keystore information, and the
algorithms used to protect private/secret keys in the
keystore and the integrity of the keystore itself. Keystore
implementations of different types are not compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
works on any file&minus;based keystore implementation. (It
treats the keystore location that is passed to it at the
command line as a filename and converts it to a
FileInputStream, from which it loads the keystore
information.) The <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>policytool</b>
tools, on the other hand, can read a keystore from any
location that can be specified using a URL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b>, you can specify a
keystore type at the command line, via the
<i>&minus;storetype</i> option. For <b>Policy Tool</b>, you
can specify a keystore type via the &quot;Keystore&quot;
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t explicitly specify a keystore type, the tools
choose a keystore implementation based simply on the value
of the <i>keystore.type</i> property specified in the
security properties file. The security properties file is
called <i>java.security</i>, and it resides in the security
properties directory, <i>java.home</i>/lib/security, where
<i>java.home</i> is the runtime environment&rsquo;s
directory (the <i>jre</i> directory in the SDK or the
top&minus;level directory of the Java 2 Runtime
Environment).</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Each tool gets
the <i>keystore.type</i> value and then examines all the
currently&minus;installed providers until it finds one that
implements keystores of that type. It then uses the keystore
implementation from that provider.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>KeyStore</i> class defines a static method named
<i>getDefaultType</i> that lets applications and applets
retrieve the value of the <i>keystore.type</i> property. The
following line of code creates an instance of the default
keystore type (as specified in the <i>keystore.type</i>
property): <b><br>
KeyStore keyStore =
KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The default
keystore type is &quot;jks&quot; (the proprietary type of
the keystore implementation provided by Oracle). This is
specified by the following line in the security properties
file: <b><br>
keystore.type=jks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">To have the
tools utilize a keystore implementation other than the
default, you can change that line to specify a different
keystore type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have a provider package that supplies a keystore
implementation for a keystore type called
&quot;pkcs12&quot;, change the line to <b><br>
keystore.type=pkcs12</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Note: case
doesn&rsquo;t matter in keystore type designations. For
example, &quot;JKS&quot; would be considered the same as
&quot;jks&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Certificate</b>
<br>
A <b>certificate</b> (also known as a <b>public&minus;key
certificate</b>) is a digitally signed statement from one

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">These are
numbers associated with a particular entity, and are
intended to be known to everyone who needs to have trusted
interactions with that entity. Public keys are used to
verify signatures. <br>
Digitally Signed</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">If some data is
<i>digitally signed</i> it has been stored with the
&quot;identity&quot; of an entity, and a signature that
proves that entity knows about the data. The data is

private key. <br>
Identity</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">A known way of
addressing an entity. In some systems the identity is the
public key, in others it can be anything from a Unix UID to
an Email address to an X.509 Distinguished Name. <br>
Signature</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">A signature is
computed over some data using the private key of an entity
(the <i>signer</i>, which in the case of a certificate is
also known as the <i>issuer</i>). <br>
Private Keys</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">These are
numbers, each of which is supposed to be known only to the
particular entity whose private key it is (that is,
it&rsquo;s supposed to be kept secret). Private and public
keys exist in pairs in all public key cryptography systems
(also referred to as &quot;public key crypto systems&quot;).
In a typical public key crypto system, such as DSA, a
private key corresponds to exactly one public key. Private
keys are used to compute signatures. <br>
Entity</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">An entity is a
person, organization, program, computer, business, bank, or
something else you are trusting to some degree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Basically,
public key cryptography requires access to users&rsquo;
public keys. In a large&minus;scale networked environment it
is impossible to guarantee that prior relationships between
communicating entities have been established or that a
trusted repository exists with all used public keys.
Certificates were invented as a solution to this public key
distribution problem. Now a <i>Certification Authority</i>
(CA) can act as a trusted third party. CAs are entities (for
example, businesses) that are trusted to sign (issue)
certificates for other entities. It is assumed that CAs will
only create valid and reliable certificates, as they are
bound by legal agreements. There are many public
Certification Authorities, such as <i>VeriSign</i> @ <br>
http://www.verisign.com/, <i>Thawte</i> @ <br>
http://www.thawte.com/, <i>Entrust</i> @ <br>
http://www.entrust.com/, and so on. You can also run your
own Certification Authority using products such as Microsoft
Certificate Server or the Entrust CA product for your
organization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>keytool</b>, it is possible to display, import, and

</table>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The X.509
standard defines what information can go into a certificate,
and describes how to write it down (the data format). All
the data in a certificate is encoded using two related
standards called ASN.1/DER. <i>Abstract Syntax Notation
1</i> describes data. The <i>Definite Encoding Rules</i>
describe a single way to store and transfer that data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">All X.509
certificates have the following data, in addition to the
signature:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%;">Version</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">This identifies
which version of the X.509 standard applies to this
certificate, which affects what information can be specified
in it. Thus far, three versions are defined. <b>keytool</b>
can import and export v1, v2, and v3 certificates. It
generates v3 certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em"><i>X.509
Version 1</i> has been available since 1988, is widely
deployed, and is the most generic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em"><i>X.509
Version 2</i> introduced the concept of subject and issuer
unique identifiers to handle the possibility of reuse of
subject and/or issuer names over time. Most certificate
profile documents strongly recommend that names not be
reused, and that certificates should not make use of unique
identifiers. Version 2 certificates are not widely used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em"><i>X.509
Version 3</i> is the most recent (1996) and supports the
notion of extensions, whereby anyone can define an extension
and include it in the certificate. Some common extensions in
use today are: <i>KeyUsage</i> (limits the use of the keys
to particular purposes such as
&quot;signing&minus;only&quot;) and <i>AlternativeNames</i>
(allows other identities to also be associated with this
public key, e.g. DNS names, Email addresses, IP addresses).
Extensions can be marked <i>critical</i> to indicate that
the extension should be checked and enforced/used. For
example, if a certificate has the KeyUsage extension marked
critical and set to &quot;keyCertSign&quot; then if this
certificate is presented during SSL communication, it should
be rejected, as the certificate extension indicates that the
associated private key should only be used for signing
certificates and not for SSL use. <br>
Serial Number</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">The entity that
created the certificate is responsible for assigning it a
serial number to distinguish it from other certificates it
issues. This information is used in numerous ways, for
example when a certificate is revoked its serial number is
placed in a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). <br>
Signature Algorithm Identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">This identifies
the algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate. <br>
Issuer Name</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">The X.500
Distinguished Name of the entity that signed the
certificate. This is normally a CA. Using this certificate
implies trusting the entity that signed this certificate.
(Note that in some cases, such as <i>root or
top&minus;level</i> CA certificates, the issuer signs its
own certificate.) <br>
Validity Period</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">Each
certificate is valid only for a limited amount of time. This
period is described by a start date and time and an end date
and time, and can be as short as a few seconds or almost as
long as a century. The validity period chosen depends on a
number of factors, such as the strength of the private key
used to sign the certificate or the amount one is willing to
pay for a certificate. This is the expected period that
entities can rely on the public value, if the associated
private key has not been compromised. <br>
Subject Name</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">The name of the
entity whose public key the certificate identifies. This
name uses the X.500 standard, so it is intended to be unique
across the Internet. This is the X.500 Distinguished Name
(DN) of the entity, for example, <b><br>
CN=Java Duke, OU=Java Software Division, O=Oracle
Corporation, C=US</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">(These refer to
the subject&rsquo;s Common Name, Organizational Unit,
Organization, and Country.) <br>
Subject Public Key Information</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
public key of the entity being named, together with an
algorithm identifier which specifies which public key crypto
system this key belongs to and any associated key
parameters.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>keytool</b>
can create and manage keystore &quot;key&quot; entries that
each contain a private key and an associated certificate
&quot;chain&quot;. The first certificate in the chain
contains the public key corresponding to the private
key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">When keys are
first generated (see the &minus;genkeypair command), the
chain starts off containing a single element, a
<i>self&minus;signed certificate</i>. A self&minus;signed
certificate is one for which the issuer (signer) is the same
as the subject (the entity whose public key is being
authenticated by the certificate). Whenever the
<i>&minus;genkeypair</i> command is called to generate a new
public/private key pair, it also wraps the public key into a
self&minus;signed certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Later, after a
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) has been generated (see
the &minus;certreq command) and sent to a Certification
Authority (CA), the response from the CA is imported (see
&minus;importcert), and the self&minus;signed certificate is
replaced by a chain of certificates. At the bottom of the
chain is the certificate (reply) issued by the CA
authenticating the subject&rsquo;s public key. The next
certificate in the chain is one that authenticates the
<i>CA</i>&rsquo;s public key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">In many cases,
this is a self&minus;signed certificate (that is, a
certificate from the CA authenticating its own public key)
and the last certificate in the chain. In other cases, the
CA may return a chain of certificates. In this case, the
bottom certificate in the chain is the same (a certificate
signed by the CA, authenticating the public key of the key
entry), but the second certificate in the chain is a
certificate signed by a <i>different</i> CA, authenticating
the public key of the CA you sent the CSR to. Then, the next
certificate in the chain will be a certificate
authenticating the second CA&rsquo;s key, and so on, until a
self&minus;signed &quot;root&quot; certificate is reached.
Each certificate in the chain (after the first) thus
authenticates the public key of the signer of the previous
certificate in the chain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Many CAs only
return the issued certificate, with no supporting chain,
especially when there is a flat hierarchy (no intermediates
CAs). In this case, the certificate chain must be
established from trusted certificate information already
stored in the keystore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">A different
reply format (defined by the PKCS#7 standard) also includes
the supporting certificate chain, in addition to the issued
certificate. Both reply formats can be handled by
<b>keytool</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The
top&minus;level (root) CA certificate is self&minus;signed.
However, the trust into the root&rsquo;s public key does not
come from the root certificate itself (anybody could
generate a self&minus;signed certificate with the
distinguished name of say, the VeriSign root CA!), but from
other sources like a newspaper. The root CA public key is
widely known. The only reason it is stored in a certificate
is because this is the format understood by most tools, so
the certificate in this case is only used as a
&quot;vehicle&quot; to transport the root CA&rsquo;s public
key. Before you add the root CA certificate to your
keystore, you should view it (using the
<i>&minus;printcert</i> option) and compare the displayed
fingerprint with the well&minus;known fingerprint (obtained
from a newspaper, the root CA&rsquo;s Web page, etc.).</p>

attacker&rsquo;s) certificate. If such an attack took place,
and you did not check the certificate before you imported
it, you would end up trusting anything the attacker has

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: it is not
required that you execute a <i>&minus;printcert</i> command
prior to importing a certificate, since before adding a

the certificate information and prompts you to verify it.
You then have the option of aborting the import operation.
Note, however, this is only the case if you invoke the
<i>&minus;importcert</i> command without the
<i>&minus;noprompt</i> option. If the <i>&minus;noprompt</i>
option is given, there is no interaction with the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Passwords can
be specified on the command line (in the

Regarding Certificate Conformance</b> <br>
The Internet standard <i>RFC 5280</i> @ <br>

on conforming X.509 certificates, which includes what values
and value combinations are valid for certificate fields and
extensions. <b>keytool</b> has not enforced all these rules
so it can generate certificates which do not conform to the
