XFS filesystem incremental dump utility</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xfsdump</i>
backs up files and their attributes in a filesystem. The
files are dumped to storage media, a regular file, or
standard output. Options allow the operator to have all
files dumped, just files that have changed since a previous
dump, or just files contained in a list of pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>xfsrestore</i>(8) utility re-populates a filesystem with
the contents of the dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each invocation
of <i>xfsdump</i> dumps just one filesystem. That invocation
is termed a dump session. The dump session splits the
filesystem into one or more dump streams, one per
destination. The split is done in filesystem inode number
(ino) order, at boundaries selected to equalize the size of
each stream. Furthermore, the breakpoints between streams
may be in the middle of very large files (at extent
boundaries) if necessary to achieve reasonable stream size
equalization. Each dump stream can span several media
objects, and a single media object can contain several dump
streams. The typical media object is a tape cartridge. The
media object records the dump stream as one or more media
files. A media file is a self-contained partial dump,
intended to minimize the impact of media dropouts on the
entire dump stream at the expense of increasing the time
required to complete the dump. By default only one media
file is written unless a media file size is specified using
the <b>&minus;d</b> option. Other techniques, such as making
a second copy of the dump image, provide more protection
against media failures than multiple media files will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xfsdump</i>
maintains an online dump inventory in
<i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>. The <b>&minus;I</b>
option displays the inventory contents hierarchically. The
levels of the hierarchy are: filesystem, dump session,
stream, and media file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options to
<i>xfsdump</i> are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;a</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Specifies that files for which the Data Migration
Facility (DMF) has complete offline copies (dual-state
files) be treated as if they were offline (OFL). This means
that the file data will not be dumped by xfsdump, resulting
in a smaller dump file. If the file is later restored the
file data is still accessible through DMF. If both
&rsquo;&minus;a option&rsquo; and &rsquo;&minus;z
option&rsquo; are specified, the &rsquo;&minus;a
option&rsquo; takes precedence (see &rsquo;&minus;z
option&rsquo; below).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b</b>
<i>blocksize</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the blocksize, in
bytes, to be used for the dump. The same blocksize must be
specified to restore the tape. If the <b>&minus;m</b> option
is not used, then <b>&minus;b</b> does not need to be
specified. Instead, a default blocksize of 1Mb will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>
<i>progname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the specified program to
alert the operator when a media change is required. The
alert program is typically a script to send a mail or flash
a window to draw the operator&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d</b>
<i>filesize</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the size, in
megabytes, of dump media files. If not specified, xfsdump
will dump data to tape using a single media file per media
object. The specified media file size may need to be
adjusted if, for example, xfsdump cannot fit a media file
onto a single tape.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;e</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Allow files to be excluded from the dump. This will
cause xfsdump to skip files which have the &quot;no
dump&quot; file attribute set. See the &quot;Excluding
individual files&quot; section below for details on setting
this file attribute.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b> <i>dest</i> [
<b>&minus;f</b> <i>dest</i> ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a dump destination. A
dump destination can be the pathname of a device (such as a
tape drive), a regular file or a remote tape drive (see
<i>rmt</i>(8)). This option must be omitted if the standard
output option (a lone <b>&minus;</b> preceding the source
filesystem specification) is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b>
<i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a dump level of 0 to
9. The dump level determines the base dump to which this
dump is relative. The base dump is the most recent dump at a
lesser level. A level 0 dump is absolute &minus; all files
are dumped. A dump level where 1 &lt;= <i>level</i> &lt;= 9
is referred to as an incremental dump. Only files that have
been changed since the base dump are dumped. Subtree dumps
(see the <b>&minus;s</b> option below) cannot be used as the
base for incremental dumps.</p>

<p><b>&minus;m</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Use the minimal tape protocol for non-scsi tape
destinations or remote tape destinations which are not scsi
Linux tape drives nor IRIX tape drives. This option cannot
be used without specifying a blocksize to be used (see
<b>&minus;b</b> option above).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;o</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Overwrite the tape. With this option, <i>xfsdump</i>
does not read the tape first to check the contents. This
option may be used if <i>xfsdump</i> is unable to determine
the block size of a tape .</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b>
<i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Causes progress reports to be
printed at the specified interval. <i>interval</i> is given
in seconds. The progress report indicates how many files
have been dumped, the total number of files to dump, the
percentage of data dumped, and the elapsed time.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;q</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Destination tape drive is a QIC tape. QIC tapes only use
a 512 byte blocksize, for which <i>xfsdump</i> must make
special allowances.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b> <i>pathname</i>
[ <b>&minus;s</b> <i>pathname</i> ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Restricts the dump to files
contained in the specified pathnames (subtrees). A
<i>pathname</i> must be relative to the mount point of the
filesystem. For example, if a filesystem is mounted at
<i>/d2</i>, the <i>pathname</i> argument for the directory
<i>/d2/users</i> is &lsquo;&lsquo;users&rsquo;&rsquo;. A
<i>pathname</i> can be a file or a directory; if it is a
directory, the entire hierarchy of files and subdirectories
rooted at that directory is dumped. Subtree dumps cannot be
used as the base for incremental dumps (see the
<b>&minus;l</b> option above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Sets the dump time to the
modification time of <i>file</i> rather than using the
current time. <i>xfsdump</i> uses the dump time to determine
what files need to be backed up during an incremental dump.
This option should be used when dumping snapshots so that
the dump time matches the time the snapshot was taken.
Otherwise files modified after a snapshot is taken may be
skipped in the next incremental dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v</b>
<i>verbosity</i> <b><br>
&minus;v</b>
<i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>[,<i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>,...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the level of detail
used for messages displayed during the course of the dump.
The <i>verbosity</i> argument can be passed as either a
string or an integer. If passed as a string the following
values may be used: <b>silent</b>, <b>verbose</b>,
<b>trace</b>, <b>debug</b>, or <b>nitty</b>. If passed as an
integer, values from 0&minus;5 may be used. The values
0&minus;4 correspond to the strings already listed. The
value 5 can be used to produce even more verbose debug
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The first form
of this option activates message logging across all dump
subsystems. The second form allows the message logging level
to be controlled on a per-subsystem basis. The two forms can
be combined (see the example below). The argument
<i>subsys</i> can take one of the following values:
<b>general</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>drive</b>, <b>media</b>,
<b>inventory</b>, <b>inomap</b> and
<b>excluded_files</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
dump the root filesystem with tracing activated for all
subsystems:</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em"><b># xfsdump
&minus;v trace &minus;f /dev/tape /</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
debug-level tracing for drive and media operations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em"><b># xfsdump
&minus;v drive=debug,media=debug &minus;f /dev/tape
/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
tracing for all subsystems, and debug level tracing for
drive operations only:</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em"><b># xfsdump
&minus;v trace,drive=debug &minus;f /dev/tape /</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">To list files
that will be excluded from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em"><b># xfsdump
&minus;e &minus;v excluded_files=debug &minus;f /dev/tape
/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;z</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the maximum size, in
kilobytes, of files to be included in the dump. Files over
this size, will be excluded from the dump, except for DMF
dual-state files when &rsquo;&minus;a option&rsquo; is
specified (see &rsquo;&minus;a option&rsquo; above). When
specified, &rsquo;&minus;a option&rsquo; takes precedence
over &rsquo;&minus;z option&rsquo;. The size is an estimate
based on the number of disk blocks actually used by the
file, and so does not include holes. In other words, size
refers to the amount of space the file would take in the
resulting dump. On an interactive restore, the skipped file
is visible with xfsrestore&rsquo;s &rsquo;ls&rsquo; and
while you can use the &rsquo;add&rsquo; and
&rsquo;extract&rsquo; commands, nothing will be
restored.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;A</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Do not dump extended file attributes. When dumping a
filesystem managed within a DMF environment this option
should not be used. DMF stores file migration status within
extended attributes associated with each file. If these
attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
recallable by DMF. Note that dumps containing extended file
attributes cannot be restored with older versions of
<i>xfsrestore</i>(8).</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;B</b>
<i>session_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the ID of the dump
session upon which this dump session is to be based. If this
option is specified, the <b>&minus;l</b> (level) and
<b>&minus;R</b> (resume) options are not allowed. Instead,
<b>xfsdump</b> determines if the current dump session should
be incremental and/or resumed, by looking at the base
session&rsquo;s level and interrupted attributes. If the
base session was interrupted, the current dump session is a
resumption of that base at the same level. Otherwise, the
current dump session is an incremental dump with a level one
greater than that of the base session. This option allows
incremental and resumed dumps to be based on any previous
dump, rather than just the most recent.</p>

<p><b>&minus;D</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Controls which directories are backed up during an
incremental dump. By default unchanged directories are
dumped if files or directories beneath them have changed.
This results in a self-contained dump -- if a base dump is
lost, or you know the file(s) you wish to restore is in an
incremental dump, you can restore just that dump without
loading the base dump(s) first. However, this method
requires a potentially expensive traversal through the
filesystem.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>&minus;D</b> is specified, unchanged directories are not
dumped. This results in a faster dump, but files will end up
in the <i>xfsrestore</i>(8) <i>orphanage</i> directory
unless the base dump(s) is loaded first.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t prompt the operator. When <i>xfsdump</i>
encounters a media object containing non-xfsdump data,
<i>xfsdump</i> normally asks the operator for permission to
overwrite. With this option the overwrite is performed, no
questions asked. When <i>xfsdump</i> encounters end-of-media
during a dump, <i>xfsdump</i> normally asks the operator if
another media object will be provided. With this option the

<p>Displays the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory (no dump is
performed). <i>xfsdump</i> records each dump session in an
online inventory in <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>.

The options are specified just as they would appear if typed
into the command line. In addition, newline characters (\n)
can be used as whitespace. The options are placed before all
options actually given on the command line, just after the

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dump
Interruption</b> <br>
A dump can be interrupted at any time and later resumed. To
interrupt, type control-C (or the current terminal interrupt
character). The operator is prompted to select one of
several operations, including dump interruption. After the
operator selects dump interruption, the dump continues until
a convenient break point is encountered (typically the end
of the current file). Very large files are broken into
smaller subfiles, so the wait for the end of the current
file is brief.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dump
Resumption</b> <br>
A previously interrupted dump can be resumed by specifying
the <b>&minus;R</b> option. If the most recent dump at the
specified level was interrupted, the new dump does not
include files already dumped, unless they have changed since
the interrupted dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Media
Management</b> <br>
A single media object can contain many dump streams.
Conversely, a single dump stream can span multiple media
objects. If a dump stream is sent to a media object already
containing one or more dumps, <i>xfsdump</i> appends the new
dump stream after the last dump stream. Media files are
never overwritten. If end-of-media is encountered during the
course of a dump, the operator is prompted to insert a new
media object into the drive. The dump stream continuation is
appended after the last media file on the new media
object.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Inventory</b>
<br>
Each dump session updates an inventory database in
<i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>. <i>xfsdump</i> uses the
inventory to determine the base of incremental and resumed
dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This database
can be displayed by invoking <i>xfsdump</i> with the
<b>&minus;I</b> option. The display uses tabbed indentation
to present the inventory hierarchically. The first level is
filesystem. The second level is session. The third level is
media stream (currently only one stream is supported). The
fourth level lists the media files sequentially composing
the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
suboptions are available to filter the display. <b><br>
&minus;I depth=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(where <i>n</i> is 1, 2, or 3)
limits the hierarchical depth of the display. When <i>n</i>
is 1, only the filesystem information from the inventory is
displayed. When <i>n</i> is 2, only filesystem and session
information are displayed. When <i>n</i> is 3, only
filesystem, session and stream information are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I
level=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(where <i>n</i> is the dump
level) limits the display to dumps of that particular dump
level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The display may
be restricted to media files contained in a specific media
object. <b><br>
&minus;I mobjid=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(where <i>value</i> is a media
ID) specifies the media object by its media ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I
mobjlabel=</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(where <i>value</i> is a media
label) specifies the media object by its media label.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the
display can be restricted to a specific filesystem. <b><br>
&minus;I mnt=</b><i>mount_point</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(that is, [hostname:]pathname),
identifies the filesystem by mountpoint. Specifying the
hostname is optional, but may be useful in a clustered
environment where more than one host can be responsible for
dumping a filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I
fsid=</b><i>filesystem_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">identifies the filesystem by
filesystem ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I
dev=</b><i>device_pathname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">(that is,
[hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the filesystem by
device. As with the <b>mnt</b> filter, specifying the
hostname is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More than one
of these suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified
at the same time to limit the display of the inventory to
those dumps of interest. However, at most four suboptions
can be specified at once: one to constrain the display
hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump level, one to
constrain the media object, and one to constrain the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>&minus;I depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape
1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt</b> would display only the
filesystem information (depth=1) for those filesystems that
were mounted on <i>host1:/test_mnt</i> at the time of the
dump, and only those filesystems dumped to the media object
labeled &quot;tape 1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dump records
may be removed (pruned) from the inventory using the
<i>xfsinvutil</i> program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
media file is placed at the end of each dump stream. This
media file contains the inventory information for the
current dump session. Its contents may be merged back into
the online inventory database at a later time using
<i>xfsrestore</i>(1M).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The inventory
files stored in <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> are not included in
the dump, even if that directory is contained within the
filesystem being dumped. Including the inventory in the dump
may lead to loss or corruption of data, should an older
version be restored overwriting the current version. To
backup the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory, the contents of
<i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> should be copied to another location
which may then be safely dumped. Upon restoration, those
files may be copied back into <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i>,
overwriting whatever files may be there, or
<i>xfsinvutil</i>(1M) may be used to selectively merge parts
of the restored inventory back into the current inventory.
Prior to version 1.1.8, <i>xfsdump</i> would include the
<i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> directory in the dump. Care should
be taken not to overwrite the <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i>
directory when restoring an old dump, by either restoring
the filesystem to another location or by copying the current
contents of <i>/var/lib/xfsdump</i> to a safe place prior to
running <i>xfsrestore</i>(1M).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Labels</b>
<br>
The operator can specify a label to identify the dump
session and a label to identify a media object. The session
label is placed in every media file produced in the course
of the dump, and is recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The media label
is used to identify media objects, and is independent of the
session label. Each media file on the media object contains
a copy of the media label. An error is returned if the
operator specifies a media label that does not match the
media label on a media object containing valid media files.
Media labels are recorded in the inventory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UUIDs</b>
<br>
UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are used in three
places: to identify the filesystem being dumped (using the
filesystem UUID, see <i>xfs</i>(5) for more details), to
identify the dump session, and to identify each media
object. The inventory display (<b>&minus;I</b>) includes all
of these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dump Level
Usage</b> <br>
The dump level mechanism provides a structured form of
incremental dumps. A dump of level <i>level</i> includes
only files that have changed since the most recent dump at a
level less than <i>level</i>. For example, the operator can
establish a dump schedule that involves a full dump every
Friday and a daily incremental dump containing only files
that have changed since the previous dump. In this case
Friday&rsquo;s dump would be at level 0, Saturday&rsquo;s at
level 1, Sunday&rsquo;s at level 2, and so on, up to the
Thursday dump at level 6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
schedule results in a very tedious restore procedure to
fully reconstruct the Thursday version of the filesystem;
<i>xfsrestore</i> would need to be fed all 7 dumps in
sequence. A compromise schedule is to use level 1 on
Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday, and level 2 on Sunday,
Tuesday, and Thursday. The Monday and Wednesday dumps would
take longer, but the worst case restore requires the
accumulation of just three dumps, one each at level 0, level
1, and level 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Quotas</b>
<br>
If the filesystem being dumped contains user quotas,
<i>xfsdump</i> will use <i>xfs_quota</i>(8) to store the
quotas in a file called <i>xfsdump_quotas</i> in the root of
the filesystem to be dumped. This file will then be included
in the dump. Upon restoration, <i>xfs_quota (8)</i> can be
used to reactivate the quotas for the filesystem. Note,
however, that the <i>xfsdump_quotas</i> file will probably
require modification to change the filesystem or UIDs if the
filesystem has been restored to a different partition or
system. Group and project quotas will be handled in a
similar fashion and saved in files called
<i>xfsdump_quotas_group</i> and <i>xfsdump_quotas_proj ,</i>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Excluding
individual files</b> <br>
It may be desirable to exclude particular files or
directories from the dump. The <b>-s</b> option can be used
to limit the dump to a specified directory, and the
<b>-z</b> option can be used to exclude files over a
particular size. Additionally, when <i>xfsdump</i> is run
with the <b>-e</b> option, files that are tagged with the
&quot;no dump&quot; file attribute will not be included in
the dump. The <i>chattr</i>(1) command can be used to set
this attribute on individual files or entire subtrees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To tag an
individual file for exclusion from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$ chattr +d
file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To tag all
files in a subtree for exclusion from the dump:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$ chattr
&minus;R +d directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that any
new files or directories created in a directory which has
the &quot;no dump&quot; attribute set will automatically
inherit this attribute. Also note that <i>xfsdump</i> does
not check directories for the &quot;no dump&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Care should be
taken to note which files have been tagged. Under normal
operation, <i>xfsdump</i> will only report the number of
files it will skip. The <b>&minus;v excluded_files=debug</b>
option, however, will cause <i>xfsdump</i> to list the inode
numbers of the individual files affected.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The media
format used by <i>xfsdump</i> can only be understood by
<i>xfsrestore</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xfsdump</i>
does not know how to manage CD-ROM or other removable disk
drives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>xfsdump</i>
can become confused when doing incremental or resumed dumps
if on the same machine you dump two XFS filesystems and both
filesystems have the same filesystem identifier (UUID).
Since <i>xfsdump</i> uses the filesystem identifier to
identify filesystems, <i>xfsdump</i> maintains one combined
set of dump inventories for both filesystems instead of two
sets of dump inventories. This scenario can happen only if
<i>dd</i> or some other block-by-block copy program was used
to make a copy of an XFS filesystem. See <i>xfs_copy</i>(8)
and <i>xfs</i>(5) for more details.</p>
