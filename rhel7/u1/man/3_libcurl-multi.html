<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl-multi
&minus; how to use the multi interface</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is an
overview on how to use the libcurl multi interface in your C
programs. There are specific man pages for each function
mentioned in here. There&rsquo;s also the
<i>libcurl-tutorial(3)</i> man page for a complete tutorial
to programming with libcurl and the <i>libcurl-easy(3)</i>
man page for an overview of the libcurl easy interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
in the multi interface are prefixed with curl_multi.</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVES
<a name="OBJECTIVES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The multi
interface offers several abilities that the easy interface
doesn&rsquo;t. They are mainly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. Enable a
&quot;pull&quot; interface. The application that uses
libcurl decides where and when to ask libcurl to get/send
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Enable
multiple simultaneous transfers in the same thread without
making it complicated for the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Enable the
application to wait for action on its own file descriptors
and curl&rsquo;s file descriptors simultaneous easily.</p>

<h2>ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES
<a name="ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use the
multi interface, you must first create a &rsquo;multi
handle&rsquo; with <i>curl_multi_init(3)</i>. This handle is
then used as input to all further curl_multi_*
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each single
transfer is built up with an easy handle. You must create
them, and setup the appropriate options for each easy
handle, as outlined in the <i>libcurl(3)</i> man page, using
<i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the easy
handle is setup for a transfer, then instead of using
<i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> (as when using the easy
interface for transfers), you should instead add the easy
handle to the multi handle using
<i>curl_multi_add_handle(3)</i>. The multi handle is
sometimes referred to as a &acute;multi stack&acute; because
of the fact that it may hold a large amount of easy
handles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Should you
change your mind, the easy handle is again removed from the
multi stack using <i>curl_multi_remove_handle(3)</i>. Once
removed from the multi handle, you can again use other easy
interface functions like <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> on the
handle or whatever you think is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adding the easy
handle to the multi handle does not start the transfer.
Remember that one of the main ideas with this interface is
to let your application drive. You drive the transfers by
invoking <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>. libcurl will then
transfer data if there is anything available to transfer.
It&rsquo;ll use the callbacks and everything else you have
setup in the individual easy handles. It&rsquo;ll transfer
data on all current transfers in the multi stack that are
ready to transfer anything. It may be all, it may be
none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your
application can acquire knowledge from libcurl when it would
like to get invoked to transfer data, so that you
don&rsquo;t have to busy-loop and call that
<i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> like crazy.
<i>curl_multi_fdset(3)</i> offers an interface using which
you can extract fd_sets from libcurl to use in select() or
poll() calls in order to get to know when the transfers in
the multi stack might need attention. This also makes it
very easy for your program to wait for input on your own
private file descriptors at the same time or perhaps timeout
every now and then, should you want that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>
stores the number of still running transfers in one of its
input arguments, and by reading that you can figure out when
all the transfers in the multi handles are done.
&rsquo;done&rsquo; does not mean successful. One or more of
the transfers may have failed. Tracking when this number
changes, you know when one or more transfers are done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get
information about completed transfers, to figure out success
or not and similar, <i>curl_multi_info_read(3)</i> should be
called. It can return a message about a current or previous
transfer. Repeated invokes of the function get more messages
until the message queue is empty. The information you
receive there includes an easy handle pointer which you may
use to identify which easy handle the information
regards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a single
transfer is completed, the easy handle is still left added
to the multi stack. You need to first remove the easy handle
with <i>curl_multi_remove_handle(3)</i> and then close it
with <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i>, or possibly set new
options to it and add it again with
<i>curl_multi_add_handle(3)</i> to start another
transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When all
transfers in the multi stack are done, cleanup the multi
handle with <i>curl_multi_cleanup(3)</i>. Be careful and
please note that you <b>MUST</b> invoke separate
<i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i> calls on every single easy
handle to clean them up properly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
re-use an easy handle that was added to the multi handle for
transfer, you must first remove it from the multi stack and
then re-add it again (possibly after having altered some
options at your own choice).</p>

<h2>MULTI_SOCKET
<a name="MULTI_SOCKET"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>curl_multi_socket_action(3)</i>
function offers a way for applications to not only avoid
being forced to use select(), but it also offers a much more
high-performance API that will make a significant difference
for applications using large numbers of simultaneous
connections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>curl_multi_socket_action(3)</i>
is then used instead of <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using this
API, you add easy handles to the multi handle just as with
the normal multi interface. Then you also set two callbacks
with the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION and CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION
options to <i>curl_multi_setopt(3)</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The API is then
designed to inform your application about which sockets
libcurl is currently using and for what activities (read
and/or write) on those sockets your application is expected
to wait for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your
application must then make sure to receive all sockets
informed about in the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION callback and
make sure it reacts on the given activity on them. When a
socket has the given activity, you call
<i>curl_multi_socket_action(3)</i> specifying which socket
and action there are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION callback is called to set a timeout.
When that timeout expires, your application should call the
<i>curl_multi_socket_action(3)</i> function saying it was
due to a timeout.</p>

<h2>BLOCKING
<a name="BLOCKING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A few areas in
the code are still using blocking code, even when used from
the multi interface. While we certainly want and intend for
these to get fixed in the future, you should be aware of the
following current restrictions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- Name resolves
unless the c-ares or threaded-resolver backends are used
<br>
- NSS SSL connections <br>
- HTTP proxy CONNECT operations <br>
- SOCKS proxy handshakes <br>
- file:// transfers <br>
- TELNET transfers</p>
