<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng is
a fast, minimal tool to analyze network packets, capture
pcap files, replay pcap files, and redirect traffic between
interfaces with the help of zero-copy packet(7) sockets.
netsniff-ng uses both Linux specific RX_RING and TX_RING
interfaces to perform zero-copy. This is to avoid copy and
system call overhead between kernel and user address space.
When we started working on netsniff-ng, the pcap(3) library
did not use this zero-copy facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng is
Linux specific, meaning there is no support for other
operating systems. Therefore we can keep the code footprint
quite minimal and to the point. Linux packet(7) sockets and
its RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces bypass the normal packet
processing path through the networking stack. This is the
fastest capturing or transmission performance one can get
from user space out of the box, without having to load
unsupported or non-mainline third-party kernel modules. We
explicitly refuse to build netsniff-ng on top of
ntop/PF_RING. Not because we do not like it (we do find it
interesting), but because of the fact that it is not part of
the mainline kernel. Therefore, the ntop project has to
maintain and sync out-of-tree drivers to adapt them to their
DNA. Eventually, we went for untainted Linux kernel, since
its code has a higher rate of review, maintenance, security
and bug fixes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng
also supports early packet filtering in the kernel. It has
support for low-level and high-level packet filters that are
translated into Berkeley Packet Filter instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng can
capture pcap files in several different pcap formats that
are interoperable with other tools. It has different pcap
I/O methods supported (scatter-gather, mmap(2), read(2), and
write(2)) for efficient to-disc capturing. netsniff-ng is
also able to rotate pcap files based on data size or time
intervals, thus, making it a useful backend tool for
subsequent traffic analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng
itself also supports analysis, replaying, and dumping of raw
802.11 frames. For online or offline analysis, netsniff-ng
has a built-in packet dissector for the current 802.3
(Ethernet), 802.11* (WLAN), ARP, MPLS, 802.1Q (VLAN),
802.1QinQ, LLDP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, IGMP, TCP and
UDP, including GeoIP location analysis. Since netsniff-ng
does not establish any state or perform reassembly during
packet dissection, its memory footprint is quite low, thus,
making netsniff-ng quite efficient for offline analysis of
large pcap files as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
netsniff-ng is currently not multithreaded. However, this
does not prevent you from starting multiple netsniff-ng
instances that are pinned to different, non-overlapping CPUs
and f.e. have different BPF filters attached. Likely that at
some point in time your harddisc might become a bottleneck
assuming you do not rotate such pcaps in ram (and from there
periodically scheduled move to slower medias). You can then
use mergecap(1) to transform all pcaps into a single large
pcap. Thus, netsniff-ng then works multithreaded
eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng can
also be used to debug netlink traffic.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-i
&lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, -d &lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, --in
&lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;, --dev &lt;dev|pcap|-&gt;</b> <br>
Defines an input device. This can either be a networking
device, a pcap file or stdin (&ldquo;&minus;&rdquo;). In
case of a pcap file, the pcap type (&ldquo;&minus;D&rdquo;
option) is determined automatically by the pcap file magic.
In case of stdin, it is assumed that the input stream is a
pcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-o
&lt;dev|pcap|dir|cfg|-&gt;, --out
&lt;dev|pcap|dir|cfg|-&gt;</b> <br>
Defines the output device. This can either be a networking
device, a pcap file, a folder, a trafgen(8) configuration
file or stdout (&ldquo;-&rdquo;). In the case of a pcap file
that should not have the default pcap type (0xa1b2c3d4), the
additional option &ldquo;&minus;T&rdquo; must be provided.
If a directory is given, then, instead of a single pcap
file, multiple pcap files are generated with rotation based
on maximum file size or a given interval
(&ldquo;&minus;F&rdquo; option). A trafgen configuration
file can currently only be specified if the input device is
a pcap file. If stdout is given as a device, then a trafgen
configuration will be written to stdout if the input device
is a pcap file, or a pcap file if the input device is a
networking device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-f, --filter
&lt;bpf-file|expr&gt;</b> <br>
Specifies to not dump all traffic, but to filter the network
packet haystack. As a filter, either a bpfc(8) compiled file
can be passed as a parameter or a tcpdump(1)-like filter
expression in quotes. For details regarding the bpf-file
have a look at bpfc(8), for details regarding a
tcpdump(1)-like filter have a look at section &ldquo;filter
example&rdquo; or at pcap-filter(7). A filter expression may
also be passed to netsniff-ng without option
&ldquo;&minus;f&rdquo; in case there is no subsequent option
following after the command-line filter expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-t, --type
&lt;type&gt;</b> <br>
This defines some sort of filtering mechanisms in terms of
addressing. Possible values for type are &ldquo;host&rdquo;
(to us), &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; (to all),
&ldquo;multicast&rdquo; (to group), &ldquo;others&rdquo;
(promiscuous mode) or &ldquo;outgoing&rdquo; (from us).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-F,
--interval &lt;size|time&gt;</b> <br>
If the output device is a folder, with
&ldquo;&minus;F&rdquo;, it is possible to define the pcap
file rotation interval either in terms of size or time.
Thus, when the interval limit has been reached, a new pcap
file will be started. As size parameter, the following
values are accepted &ldquo;&lt;num&gt;KiB/MiB/GiB&rdquo;; As
time parameter, it can be
&ldquo;&lt;num&gt;s/sec/min/hrs&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-J,
--jumbo-support</b> <br>
By default, in pcap replay or redirect mode,
netsniff-ng&rsquo;s ring buffer frames are a fixed size of
2048 bytes. This means that if you are expecting jumbo
frames or even super jumbo frames to pass through your
network, then you need to enable support for that by using
this option. However, this has the disadvantage of
performance degradation and a bigger memory footprint for
the ring buffer. Note that this doesn&rsquo;t affect (pcap)
capturing mode, since tpacket in version 3 is used!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-R,
--rfraw</b> <br>
In case the input or output networking device is a wireless
device, it is possible with netsniff-ng to turn this into
monitor mode and create a mon&lt;X&gt; device that
netsniff-ng will be listening on instead of wlan&lt;X&gt;,
for instance. This enables netsniff-ng to analyze, dump, or
even replay raw 802.11 frames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-n
&lt;0|uint&gt;, --num &lt;0|uint&gt;</b> <br>
Process a number of packets and then exit. If the number of
packets is 0, then this is equivalent to infinite packets
resp. processing until interrupted. Otherwise, a number
given as an unsigned integer will limit processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-P
&lt;name&gt;, --prefix &lt;name&gt;</b> <br>
When dumping pcap files into a folder, a file name prefix
can be defined with this option. If not otherwise specified,
the default prefix is &ldquo;dump&minus;&rdquo; followed by
a Unix timestamp. Use &ldquo;&minus;&minus;prefex
&quot;&quot;&rdquo; to set filename as seconds since the
Unix Epoch e.g. 1369179203.pcap</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-T
&lt;pcap-magic&gt;, --magic &lt;pcap-magic&gt;</b> <br>
Specify a pcap type for storage. Different pcap types with
their various meta data capabilities are shown with option
&ldquo;&minus;D&rdquo;. If not otherwise specified, the
pcap-magic 0xa1b2c3d4, also known as a standard
tcpdump-capable pcap format, is used. Pcap files with
swapped endianness are also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-D,
--dump-pcap-types</b> <br>
Dump all available pcap types with their capabilities and
magic numbers that can be used with option
&ldquo;&minus;T&rdquo; to stdout and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-B,
--dump-bpf</b> <br>
If a Berkeley Packet Filter is given, for example via option
&ldquo;&minus;f&rdquo;, then dump the BPF disassembly to
stdout during ring setup. This only serves for informative
or verification purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r,
--rand</b> <br>
If the input and output device are both networking devices,
then this option will randomize packet order in the output
ring buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-M,
--no-promisc</b> <br>
The networking interface will not be put into promiscuous
mode. By default, promiscuous mode is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-A,
--no-sock-mem</b> <br>
On startup and shutdown, netsniff-ng tries to increase
socket read and write buffers if appropriate. This option
will prevent netsniff-ng from doing so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-m,
--mmap</b> <br>
Use mmap(2) as pcap file I/O. This is the default when
replaying pcap files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-G, --sg</b>
<br>
Use scatter-gather as pcap file I/O. This is the default
when capturing pcap files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-c,
--clrw</b> <br>
Use slower read(2) and write(2) I/O. This is not the default
case anywhere, but in some situations it could be preferred
as it has a lower latency on write-back to disc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-S
&lt;size&gt;, --ring-size &lt;size&gt;</b> <br>
Manually define the RX_RING resp. TX_RING size in
&ldquo;&lt;num&gt;KiB/MiB/GiB&rdquo;. By default, the size
is determined based on the network connectivity rate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-k
&lt;uint&gt;, --kernel-pull &lt;uint&gt;</b> <br>
Manually define the interval in micro-seconds where the
kernel should be triggered to batch process the ring buffer
frames. By default, it is every 10us, but it can manually be
prolonged, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-b
&lt;cpu&gt;, --bind-cpu &lt;cpu&gt;</b> <br>
Pin netsniff-ng to a specific CPU and also pin resp. migrate
the NIC&rsquo;s IRQ CPU affinity to this CPU. This option
should be preferred in combination with
&ldquo;&minus;s&rdquo; in case a middle to high packet rate
is expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-u
&lt;uid&gt;, --user &lt;uid&gt; resp. -g &lt;gid&gt;,
--group &lt;gid&gt;</b> <br>
After ring setup drop privileges to a non-root user/group
combination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-H,
--prio-high</b> <br>
Set this process as a high priority process in order to
achieve a higher scheduling rate resp. CPU time. This is
however not the default setting, since it could lead to
starvation of other processes, for example low priority
kernel threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-Q,
--notouch-irq</b> <br>
Do not reassign the NIC&rsquo;s IRQ CPU affinity
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-s,
--silent</b> <br>
Do not enter the packet dissector at all and do not print
any packet information to the terminal. Just shut up and be
silent. This option should be preferred in combination with
pcap recording or replay, since it will not flood your
terminal which causes a significant performance
degradation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-q,
--less</b> <br>
Print a less verbose one-line information for each packet to
the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-X,
--hex</b> <br>
Only dump packets in hex format to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-l,
--ascii</b> <br>
Only display ASCII printable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-U,
--update</b> <br>
If geographical IP location is used, the built-in database
update mechanism will be invoked to get Maxmind&rsquo;s
latest database. To configure search locations for
databases, the file /etc/netsniff-ng/geoip.conf contains
possible addresses. Thus, to save bandwidth or for mirroring
of Maxmind&rsquo;s databases (to bypass their traffic limit
policy), different hosts or IP addresses can be placed into
geoip.conf, separated by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-V,
--verbose</b> <br>
Be more verbose during startup i.e. show detailed ring setup
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-v,
--version</b> <br>
Show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-h,
--help</b> <br>
Show user help and exit.</p>

<h2>USAGE EXAMPLE
<a name="USAGE EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng</b>
<br>
The most simple command is to just run
&ldquo;netsniff-ng&rdquo;. This will start listening on all
available networking devices in promiscuous mode and dump
the packet dissector output to the terminal. No files will
be recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in eth0 --out dump.pcap -s -T 0xa1e2cb12 -b 0 tcp or
udp</b> <br>
Capture TCP or UDP traffic from the networking device eth0
into the pcap file named dump.pcap, which has netsniff-ng
specific pcap extensions (see &ldquo;netsniff-ng
&minus;D&rdquo; for capabilities). Also, do not print the
content to the terminal and pin the process and NIC IRQ
affinity to CPU 0. The pcap write method is scatter-gather
I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in wlan0 --rfraw --out dump.pcap --silent --bind-cpu 0</b>
<br>
Put the wlan0 device into monitoring mode and capture all
raw 802.11 frames into the file dump.pcap. Do not dissect
and print the content to the terminal and pin the process
and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The pcap write method is
scatter-gather I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in dump.pcap --mmap --out eth0 -k1000 --silent --bind-cpu
0</b> <br>
Replay the pcap file dump.pcap which is read through mmap(2)
I/O and send the packets out via the eth0 networking device.
Do not dissect and print the content to the terminal and pin
the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. Also, trigger the
kernel every 1000us to traverse the TX_RING instead of every
10us. Note that the pcap magic type is detected
automatically from the pcap file header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in eth0 --out eth1 --silent --bind-cpu 0 --type host
-r</b> <br>
Redirect network traffic from the networking device eth0 to
eth1 for traffic that is destined for our host, thus ignore
broadcast, multicast and promiscuous traffic. Randomize the
order of packets for the outgoing device and do not print
any packet contents to the terminal. Also, pin the process
and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in team0 --out /opt/probe/ -s -m --interval 100MiB -b
0</b> <br>
Capture on an aggregated team0 networking device and dump
packets into multiple pcap files that are split into 100MiB
each. Use mmap(2) I/O as a pcap write method, support for
super jumbo frames is built-in (does not need to be
configured here), and do not print the captured data to the
terminal. Pin netsniff-ng and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The
default pcap magic type is 0xa1b2c3d4 (tcpdump-capable
pcap).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in vlan0 --out dump.pcap -c -u &lsquo;id -u bob&lsquo; -g
&lsquo;id -g bob&lsquo;</b> <br>
Capture network traffic on device wlan0 into a pcap file
called dump.pcap by using normal read(2), write(2) I/O for
the pcap file (slower but less latency). Also, after setting
up the RX_RING for capture, drop privileges from root to the
user and group &ldquo;bob&rdquo;. Invoke the packet
dissector and print packet contents to the terminal for
further analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in any --filter http.bpf -B --ascii -V</b> <br>
Capture from all available networking interfaces and install
a low-level filter that was previously compiled by bpfc(8)
into http.bpf in order to filter HTTP traffic. Super jumbo
frame support is automatically enabled and only print human
readable packet data to the terminal, and also be more
verbose during setup phase. Moreover, dump a BPF disassembly
of http.bpf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
--in dump.pcap --out dump.cfg --silent</b> <br>
Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8)
configuration file dump.cfg. Do not print pcap contents to
the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
-i dump.pcap -f beacon.bpf -o -</b> <br>
Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8)
configuration file and write it to stdout. However, do not
dump all of its content, but only the one that passes the
low-level filter for raw 802.11 from beacon.bpf. The BPF
engine here is invoked in user space inside of netsniff-ng,
so Linux extensions are not available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cat foo.pcap
| netsniff-ng -i - -o -</b> <br>
Read a pcap file from stdin and convert it into a trafgen(8)
configuration file to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>modprobe
nlmon <br>
ip link add type nlmon <br>
ip link set nlmon0 up <br>
netsniff-ng -i nlmon0 -o dump.pcap -s <br>
ip link set nlmon0 down <br>
ip link del dev nlmon0 <br>
rmmod nlmon</b> <br>
In this example, netlink traffic is being captured. If not
already done, a netlink monitoring device needs to be set up
before it can be used to capture netlink socket buffers
(iproute2&rsquo;s ip(1) commands are given for nlmon device
setup and teardown). netsniff-ng can then make use of the
nlmon device as an input device. In this example a pcap file
with netlink traffic is being recorded.</p>

<h2>CONFIG FILES
<a name="CONFIG FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files under
/etc/netsniff-ng/ can be modified to extend
netsniff-ng&rsquo;s functionality:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* oui.conf -
OUI/MAC vendor database <br>
* ether.conf - Ethernet type descriptions <br>
* tcp.conf - TCP port/services map <br>
* udp.conf - UDP port/services map <br>
* geoip.conf - GeoIP database mirrors</p>

<h2>FILTER EXAMPLE
<a name="FILTER EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng
supports both, low-level and high-level filters that are
attached to its packet(7) socket. Low-level filters are
described in the bpfc(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Low-level
filters can be used with netsniff-ng in the following
way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. bpfc foo
&gt; bar <br>
2. netsniff-ng &minus;f bar</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, foo is
the bpfc program that will be translated into a netsniff-ng
readable &ldquo;opcodes&rdquo; file and passed to
netsniff-ng through the &minus;f option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
high-level filter can be either passed through the &minus;f
option, e.g. &minus;f &quot;tcp or udp&quot; or at the end
of all options without the &ldquo;&minus;f&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filter
syntax is the same as in tcpdump(8), which is described in
the man page pcap-filter(7). Just to quote some examples
from pcap-filter(7):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>host

sundown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>host helios

To select all IP packets between ace and any host except
helios.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>net

To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at
Berkeley.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gateway snup

To select all FTP traffic through Internet gateway snup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ip and not

To select traffic neither sourced from, nor destined for,
local hosts. If you have a gateway to another network, this
traffic should never make it onto your local network.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tcp[tcpflags]
&amp; (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net

To select all IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80, that is
to say, print only packets that contain data, not, for
example, SYN and FIN packets and ACK-only packets. (IPv6 is
left as an exercise for the reader.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gateway snup

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng
supports a couple of pcap formats, visible through
&lsquo;&lsquo;netsniff-ng &minus;D&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tcpdump-capable
pcap (default)</b> <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2c3d4 resp. 0xd4c3b2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
microseconds, the original packet length and the captured
packet length.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tcpdump-capable
pcap with ns resolution</b> <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b23c4d resp. 0x4d3cb2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
nanoseconds, the original packet length and the captured
packet length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alexey
Kuznetzov&rsquo;s pcap</b> <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2cd34 resp. 0x34cdb2a1.
As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in
microseconds, the original packet length, the captured
packet length, the interface index (sll_ifindex), the
packet&rsquo;s protocol (sll_protocol), and the packet type
(sll_pkttype).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>netsniff-ng
pcap</b> <br>
Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1e2cb12 resp. 0x12cbe2a1.

length, the timestamp hw/sw source, the interface index
(sll_ifindex), the packet&rsquo;s protocol (sll_protocol),
the packet type (sll_pkttype) and the hardware type
(sll_hatype).</p>

<h2>NOTE
<a name="NOTE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For introducing
bit errors, delays with random variation and more while
replaying pcaps, make use of tc(8) with its disciplines such
as netem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">netsniff-ng
does only some basic, architecture generic tuning on
startup. If you are considering to do high performance
capturing, you need to carefully tune your machine, both
hardware and software. Simply letting netsniff-ng run
without thinking about your underlying system might not
necessarily give you the desired performance. Note that
tuning your system is always a tradeoff and fine-grained
balancing act (throughput versus latency). You should know
what you are doing!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One
recommendation for software-based tuning is tuned(8).
Besides that, there are many other things to consider. Just
to throw you a few things that you might want to look at:
NAPI networking drivers, tickless kernel, I/OAT DMA engine,
Direct Cache Access, RAM-based file systems, multi-queues,
and many more things. Also, you might want to read the
kernel&rsquo;s Documentation/networking/scaling.txt file
regarding technologies such as RSS, RPS, RFS, aRFS and XPS.
Also check your ethtool(8) settings, for example regarding
offloading or Ethernet pause frames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Moreover, to
get a deeper understanding of netsniff-ng internals and how
it interacts with the Linux kernel, the kernel documentation
under Documentation/networking/{packet_mmap.txt, filter.txt,
multiqueue.txt} might be of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do you
sniff in a switched environment? I rudely refer to
dSniff&rsquo;s documentation that says:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The easiest
route is simply to impersonate the local gateway, stealing
client traffic en route to some remote destination. Of
course, the traffic must be forwarded by your attacking
machine, either by enabling kernel IP forwarding or with a
userland program that accomplishes the same (fragrouter
&minus;B1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several people
have reportedly destroyed connectivity on their LAN to the
outside world by ARP spoofing the gateway, and forgetting to
enable IP forwarding on the attacking machine. Do not do
this. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A safer option
than ARP spoofing would be to use a &quot;port mirror&quot;
function if your switch hardware supports it and if you have
access to the switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do not
need to dump all possible traffic, you have to consider
running netsniff-ng with a BPF filter for the ingress path.
For that purpose, read the bpfc(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, to
aggregate multiple NICs that you want to capture on, you
should consider using team devices, further explained in
libteam resp. teamd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
netsniff-ng pcap magic numbers are compatible with other
tools, at least tcpdump or Wireshark:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0xa1b2c3d4
(tcpdump-capable pcap) <br>
0xa1b23c4d (tcpdump-capable pcap with ns resolution) <br>
0xa1b2cd34 (Alexey Kuznetzov&rsquo;s pcap)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pcap files with
different meta data endianness are supported by netsniff-ng
as well.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When replaying
pcap files, the timing information from the pcap packet
header is currently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, when
replaying pcap files, demultiplexing traffic among multiple
networking interfaces does not work. Currently, it is only
sent via the interface that is given by the
&minus;&minus;out parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When performing
traffic capture on the Ethernet interface, the pcap file is
created and packets are received but without a 802.1Q
header. When one uses tshark, all headers are visible, but
netsniff-ng removes 802.1Q headers. Is that normal
behavior?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Yes and no. The
way VLAN headers are handled in PF_PACKET sockets by the
kernel is somewhat &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; [1]. The
problem in the Linux kernel is that some drivers already
handle VLANs, others do not. Those who handle it can have
different implementations, such as hardware acceleration and
so on. So in some cases the VLAN tag is even stripped before
entering the protocol stack, in some cases probably not. The
bottom line is that a &quot;hack&quot; was introduced in
PF_PACKET so that a VLAN ID is visible in some helper data
structure that is accessible from the RX_RING.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then it gets
really messy in the user space to artificially put the VLAN
header back into the right place. Not to mention the
resulting performance implications on all of libpcap(3)
tools since parts of the packet need to be copied for
reassembly via memmove(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A user reported
the following, just to demonstrate this mess: some tests
were made with two machines, and it seems that results
depend on the driver ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AR8131: <br>
ethtool &minus;k eth0 gives &quot;rx-vlan-offload: on&quot;
<br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header <br>
ethtool &minus;K eth0 rxvlan off <br>
- wireshark gets a QinQ header even though noone sent QinQ
<br>
- netsniff-ng gets the vlan header</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RTL8111/8168B:
<br>
ethtool &minus;k eth0 gives &quot;rx-vlan-offload: on&quot;
<br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header <br>
ethtool &minus;K eth0 rxvlan off <br>
- wireshark gets the vlan header <br>
- netsniff-ng doesn&rsquo;t get the vlan header</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even if we
agreed on doing the same workaround as libpcap, we still
will not be able to see QinQ, for instance, due to the fact
that only one VLAN tag is stored in the kernel helper data
structure. We think that there should be a good consensus on
the kernel space side about what gets transferred to
userland first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Update
(28.11.2012): the Linux kernel and also bpfc(8) has built-in
support for hardware accelerated VLAN filtering, even though
tags might not be visible in the payload itself as reported
here. However, the filtering for VLANs works reliable if
your NIC supports it. See bpfc(8) for an example.</p>
