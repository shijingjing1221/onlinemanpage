<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page describes the <b>sealert</b> program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sealert is the
user interface component (either GUI or command line) to the
setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot is used to diagnose
SELinux denials and attempts to provide user friendly
explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC) and
recommendations for how one might adjust the system to
prevent the denial in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a standard
configuration setroubleshoot is composed of two components,
setroubleshootd and sealert.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">setroubleshootd
is a system daemon which runs with root privileges and
listens for audit events emitted from the kernel related to
SELinux. The audit daemon must be running. The audit daemon
sends a dbus message to the setroubleshootd daemon when the
system gets an SELinux AVC denial. The setroubleshootd
daemon then runs a series of analysis plugins which examines
the audit data related to the AVC. It records the results of
the analysis and signals any clients which have attached to
the setroubleshootd daemon that a new alert has been
seen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sealert can be
run in either a GUI mode or a command line mode. In both
instances sealert run as a user process with the privileges
associated with the user. In GUI mode it attaches to a
setroubleshootd server instance and listens for
notifications of new alerts. When a new alert arrives it
alerts the desktop user via a notification in the status
icon area. The user may then click on the alert notification
which will open an alert browser. In addition to the current
alert sealert communicates with the setroubleshootd daemon
to access all prior alerts stored in the setroubleshoot
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user may
elect to tag any given alert as &quot;ignore&quot; in the
browser which prevents any future notification for the given
alert. This is useful when a user is already aware of a
reoccurring problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sealert may
also be run in command line mode. The two most useful
command line options are -l to &quot;lookup&quot; an alert
ID and -a to &quot;analyze&quot; a log file. When
setroubleshootd generates a new alert it assigns it a local
ID and writes this as a syslog message. The -l lookup option
may then be used to retrieve the alert from the
setroubleshootd alert database and write it to stdout. This
is most useful when setroubleshootd is being run on a
headless system without the GUI desktop alert facility. The
-a analyze option is equivalent to the &quot;Scan
Logfile&quot; command in the browser. The log file is
scanned for audit messages, analysis is performed, alerts
generated, and then written to stdout.</p>

<h2>LOG FILE SCANNING
<a name="LOG FILE SCANNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may ask
sealert to parse a file accumulating all the audit messages
it finds in that file. As each audit event is recognized it
is presented for analysis which may generate an alert report
if the analysis was successful. If the same type of event is
seen multiple times resulting in the same report the results
are coalesced into a single report. The report count field
will indicate the number of times the tool thought it saw
the same issue. The report will also include a list of every
line number on which it found an audit record which
contributed to the coalesced report. This will allow you to
coordinate the contents of the file with the analysis
results if need be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Log file
scanning may be initiated from the sealert browser via the
File::ScanLogFile menu or from the command line via
&rsquo;sealert -a filename&rsquo;. Please note that sealert
runs as a user level process with the permissions of the
user running it. Many system log files are readable by root
only. To work around this if you have root access one can
copy the file as root to a temporary file and change its
permissions. This is a good solution when scanning via the
GUI as a normal user. Or you might consider su&rsquo;ing to
root and run the analysis via the command line (e.g. sealert
-a filename).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The audit
records in the log file must be valid syntactically correct
audit messages or the parser will ignore them.</p>
