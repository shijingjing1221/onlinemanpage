<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The module
<i>Locale::TextDomain</i>(3pm) provides a high-level
interface to Perl message translation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Textdomains</b>
<br>
When you request a translation for a given string, the
system used in libintl-perl follows a standard strategy to
find a suitable message catalog containing the translation:
Unless you explicitely define a name for the message
catalog, libintl-perl will assume that your catalog is
called &rsquo;messages&rsquo; (unless you have changed the
default value to something else via
<i>Locale::Messages</i>(3pm), method
<i>textdomain()</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might think
that his default strategy leaves room for optimization and
you are right. It would be a lot smarter if multiple
software packages, all with their individual message
catalogs, could be installed on one system, and it should
also be possible that third-party components of your
software (like Perl modules) can load their message
catalogs, too, without interfering with yours.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The solution is
clear, you have to assign a unique name to your message
database, and you have to specify that name at run-time.
That unique name is the so-called <i>textdomain</i> of your
software package. The name is actually arbitrary but you
should follow these best-practice guidelines to ensure
maximum interoperability: <br>
File System Safety</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">In practice, textdomains get
mapped into file names, and you should therefore make sure
that the textdomain you choose is a valid filename on every
system that will run your software.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Case-sensitivity</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Textdomains are always
case-sensitive (i. e. &rsquo;Package&rsquo; and &rsquo;
<small>PACKAGE</small> &rsquo; are not the same). However,
since the message catalogs will be stored on file systems,
that may or may not distinguish case when looking up file
names, you should avoid potential conflicts here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Textdomain Should Match
<small>CPAN</small> Name</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If your software is listed as a
module on <small>CPAN,</small> you should simply choose the
name on <small>CPAN</small> as your textdomain. The
textdomain for libintl-perl is hence
&rsquo;libintl&minus;perl&rsquo;. But please replace all
periods (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) in your package name with an
underscore because ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internet Domain Names as a
Fallback</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">... if your software is
<i>not</i> a module listed on <small>CPAN,</small> as a last
resort you should use the Java(tm) package scheme, i. e.
choose an internet domain that you are owner of (or ask the
owner of an internet domain) and concatenate your preferred
textdomain with the reversed internet domain. Example: Your
company runs the web-site &rsquo;www.foobar.org&rsquo; and
is the owner of the domain &rsquo;foobar.org&rsquo;. The
textdomain for your company&rsquo;s software
&rsquo;barfoos&rsquo; should hence be
&rsquo;org.foobar.barfoos&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
software is likely to be installed in different versions on
the same system, it is probably a good idea to append some
version information to your textdomain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other systems
are less strict with the naming scheme for textdomains but
the phenomena known as Perl is actually a plethora of small,
specialized modules and it is probably wisest to postulate
some namespace model in order to avoid chaos.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Binding
textdomains to directories</b> <br>
Once the system knows the <i>textdomain</i> of the message
that you want to get translated into the user&rsquo;s
language, it still has to find the correct message catalog.
By default, libintl-perl will look up the string in the
translation database found in the directories
<i>/usr/share/locale</i> and <i>/usr/local/share/locale</i>
(in that order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is neither
guaranteed that these directories exist on the target
machine, nor can you be sure that the installation routine
has write access to these locations. You can therefore
instruct libintl-perl to search other directories prior to
the default directories. Specifying a differnt search
directory is called <i>binding</i> a textdomain to a
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Locale::TextDomain</b>
extends the default strategy by a Perl specific approach.
Unless told otherwise, it will look for a directory
<i>LocaleData</i> in every component found in the standard
include path <tt>@INC</tt> and check for a database
containing the message for your textdomain there. Example:
If the path <i>/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/site_perl</i> is in your
<tt>@INC</tt>, you can install your translation files in
<i>/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/site_perl/LocaleData</i>, and they
will be found at run-time.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is crucial
to remember that you use <i>Locale::TextDoamin</i>(3) as
specified in the section &quot;
<small>SYNOPSIS&quot;</small> , that means you have to
<b>use</b> it, not <b>require</b> it. The module behaves
quite differently compared to other modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most
significant difference is the meaning of the list passed as
an argument to the <i>use()</i> function. It actually works
like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::TextDomain (TEXTDOMAIN, DIRECTORY, ...)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument (the first string passed to <i>use()</i>) is the
textdomain of your package, optionally followed by a list of
directories to search <i>instead</i> of the Perl-specific
directories (see above: <i>/LocaleData</i> appended to every
part of <tt>@INC</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are the
author of a package &rsquo;barfoos&rsquo;, you will probably
put the line</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::TextDomain 'barfoos';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">resp. for
non-CPAN modules</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::TextDomain 'org.foobar.barfoos';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">in every module
of your package that contains translatable strings. If your
module has been installed properly, including the message
catalogs, it will then be able to retrieve these
translations at run-time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have not
installed the translation database in a directory
<i>LocaleData</i> in the standard include path <tt>@INC</tt>
(or in the system directories <i>/usr/share/locale</i> resp.
<i>/usr/local/share/locale</i>), you have to explicitely
specify a search path by giving the names of directories (as
strings!) as additional arguments to <i>use()</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::TextDomain qw (barfoos ./dir1 ./dir2);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively
you can call the function <i>bindtextdomain()</i> with
suitable arguments (see the entry for
<i>bindtextdomain()</i> in &quot;
<small>FUNCTIONS&quot;</small> in Locale::Messages). If you
do so, you should pass <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> as an
additional argument in order to avoid unnecessary
lookups:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Locale::TextDomain ('barfoos', undef);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You see that
the arguments given to <i>use()</i> have nothing to do with
what is imported into your namespace, but they are rather
arguments to <i>textdomain()</i>, resp.
<i>bindtextdomain()</i>. Does that mean that
<b>Locale::TextDomain</b> exports nothing into your
namespace? Umh, not exactly ... in fact it imports
<i>all</i> functions listed below into your namespace, and
hence you should not define conflicting functions (and
variables) yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, why has
Locale::TextDomain to be different from other modules? If
you have ever written software in C and prepared it for
internationalization (i18n), you will probably have defined
some preprocessor macros like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #define _(String) dgettext (&quot;my&minus;textdomain&quot;, String)
    #define N_(String) String</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You only have
to define that once in C, and the textdomain for your
package is automatically inserted into all gettext
functions. In Perl there is no such mechanism (at least it
is not portable, option &minus;P) and using the gettext
functions could become quite cumbersome without some extra
fiddling:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print dgettext (&quot;my&minus;textdomain&quot;, &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is no fun.
In C it would merely be a</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    printf (_(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;));</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has to be
more concise and shorter than C ... see the next section for
how you can use <b>Locale::TextDomain</b> to end up in Perl
with a mere</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print __&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;</pre>


<h2>EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
<a name="EXPORTED FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
have quite funny names on purpose. In fact the purpose for
that is quite clear: They should be short, operator-like,
and they should not yell for conflicts with existing
functions in <i>your</i> namespace. You will understand it,
when you internationalize your first Perl program or module.
Preparing it is more like marking strings as being
translatable than inserting function calls. Here we go:
<b><br>
__ <small>MSGID</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
This is a <i>double</i> underscore!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The basic and
most-used function. It is a short-cut for a call to
<i>gettext()</i> resp. <i>dgettext()</i>, and simply returns
the translation for <b><small>MSGID</small></b> . If your
old code reads like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;permission denied&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will now
write:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __&quot;permission denied&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s
all, the string will be output in the user&rsquo;s preferred
language, provided that you have installed a translation for
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Of course you
can also use parentheses:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __(&quot;permission denied&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Or even:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print (__(&quot;permission denied&quot;));</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In my eyes, the
first version without parentheses looks best.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__x <small>MSGID,
ID1</small> =&gt; <small>VAL1, ID2</small> =&gt;
<small>VAL2, ...</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of the nicest features in
Perl is its capability to interpolate variables into
strings:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;This is the $color $thing.\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This nice
feature might con you into thinking that you could now
write</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __&quot;This is the $color $thing.\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Alas, that
would be nice, but it is not possible. Remember that the
function __() serves both as an operator for translating
strings <i>and</i> as a mark for translatable strings. If
the above string would get extracted from your Perl code,
the un-interpolated form would end up in the message catalog
because when parsing your code it is unpredictable what
values the variables <tt>$thing</tt> and <tt>$color</tt>
will have at run-time (this fact is most probably one of the
reasons you have written your program for).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, at
run-time, Perl will have interpolated the values already
<i>before</i> __() (resp. the underlying <i>gettext()</i>
function) has seen the original string. Consequently
something like &quot;This is the red car.\n&quot; will be
looked up in the message catalog, it will not be found
(because only &quot;This is the <tt>$color
$thing</tt>.\n&quot; is included in the database), and the
original, untranslated string will be returned. Honestly,
because this is almost always an error, the
<i>xgettext</i>(1) program will bail out with a fatal error
when it comes across that string in your code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
workarounds for that:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    printf __&quot;This is the %s %s.\n&quot;, $color, $thing;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But that has
several disadvantages: Your translator will only see the
isolated string, and without the surrounding code it is
almost impossible to interpret it correctly. Of course,
<small>GNU</small> emacs and other software capable of
editing <small>PO</small> translation files will allow you
to examine the context in the source code, but it is more
likely that your translator will look for a less challenging
translation project when she frequently comes across such
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">And even if she
does understand the underlying programming, what if she has
to reorder the color and the thing like in French:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    msgid &quot;This is the red car.\n&quot;;
    msgstr &quot;Cela est la voiture rouge.\n&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Zut alors! No
way! You cannot portably reorder the arguments to
<i>printf()</i> and friends in Perl (it is possible in C,
but at the time of this writing not supported in Perl, and
it would lead to other problems anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So what? The
Perl backend to <small>GNU</small> gettext has defined an
alternative format for interpolatable strings:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    &quot;This is the {color} {thing}.\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of Perl
variables you use place-holders (legal Perl variables are
also legal place-holders) in curly braces, and then you
call</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __x (&quot;This is the {color} {thing}.\n&quot;,
               thing =&gt; $thang,
               color =&gt; $color);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
_<i>_x()</i> will take the additional hash and replace all
occurencies of the hash keys in curly braces with the
corresponding values. Simple, readable, understandable to
translators, what else would you want? And if the translator
forgets, misspells or otherwise messes up some
&quot;variables&quot;, the <i>msgfmt</i>(1) program, that is
used to compile the textual translation file into its binary
representation will even choke on these errors and refuse to
compile the translation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__n <small>MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Whew! That looks complicated
... It is best explained with an example. We&rsquo;ll have
another look at your vintage code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($files_deleted &gt; 1) {
        print &quot;All files have been deleted.\n&quot;;
    } else {
        print &quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Your intent is
clear, you wanted to avoid the cumbersome &quot;1 files
deleted&quot;. This is okay for English, but other languages
have more than one plural form. For example in Russian it
makes a difference whether you want to say 1 file, 3 files
or 6 files. You will use three different forms of the noun
&rsquo;file&rsquo; in each case. [Note: Yep, very smart you
are, the Russian word for &rsquo;file&rsquo; is in fact the
English word, and it is an invariable noun, but if you know
that, you will also understand the rest despite this little
simplification ...].</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">That is the
reason for the existance of the function <i>ngettext()</i>,
that _<i>_n()</i> is a short-cut for:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __n&quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;,
             &quot;All files have been deleted.\n&quot;,
             $files_deleted;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively:</p>


<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __n (&quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;,
               &quot;All files have been deleted.\n&quot;,
               $files_deleted);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The effect is
always the same: libintl-perl will find out which plural
form to pick for your user&rsquo;s language, and the output
string will always look okay.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__nx <small>MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT, VAR1</small> =&gt; <small>VAL1,
VAR2</small> =&gt; <small>VAL2, ...</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bringing it all together:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __nx (&quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;,
                &quot;{count} files have been deleted.\n&quot;,
                $num_files,
                count =&gt; $num_files);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
_<i>_nx()</i> picks the correct plural form (also for
English!) <i>and</i> it is capable of interpolating
variables into strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Have a close
look at the order of arguments: The first argument is the
string in the singular, the second one is the plural string.
The third one is an integer indicating the number of items.
This third argument is <i>only</i> used to pick the correct
translation. The optionally following arguments make up the
hash used for interpolation. In the beginning it is often a
little confusing that the variable holding the number of
items will usually be repeated somewhere in the
interpolation hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__xn <small>MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT, VAR1</small> =&gt; <small>VAL1,
VAR2</small> =&gt; <small>VAL2, ...</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Does exactly the same thing as
_<i>_nx()</i>. In fact it is a common typo promoted to a
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__p <small>MSGCTXT,
MSGID</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is much like __. The
&quot;p&quot; stands for &quot;particular&quot;, and the
<small>MSGCTXT</small> is used to provide context to the
translator. This may be neccessary when your string is
short, and could stand for multiple things. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __p&quot;Verb, to view&quot;, &quot;View&quot;;
    print __p&quot;Noun, a view&quot;, &quot;View&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The above may
be &quot;View&quot; entries in a menu, where
View&minus;&gt;Source and File&minus;&gt;View are different
forms of &quot;View&quot;, and likely need to be translated
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A typical usage
are <small>GUI</small> programs. Imagine a program with a
main menu and the notorious &quot;Open&quot; entry in the
&quot;File&quot; menu. Now imagine, there is another menu
entry Preferences&minus;&gt;Advanced&minus;&gt;Policy where
you have a choice between the alternatives &quot;Open&quot;
and &quot;Closed&quot;. In English, &quot;Open&quot; is the
adequate text at both places. In other languages, it is very
likely that you need two different translations. Therefore,
you would now write:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    __p&quot;File|&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;;
    __p&quot;Preferences|Advanced|Policy&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In English, or
if no translation can be found, the second argument (
<small>MSGID</small> ) is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl-perl 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__px <small>MSGCTXT, MSGID,
VAR1</small> =&gt; <small>VAL1, VAR2</small> =&gt;
<small>VAL2, ...</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like _<i>_p()</i>, but supports
variable substitution in the string, like _<i>_x()</i>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __px(&quot;Verb, to view&quot;, &quot;View {file}&quot;, file =&gt; $filename);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
_<i>_p()</i> and _<i>_x()</i> for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl-perl 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__np <small>MSGCTXT, MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This adds context to plural
calls. It should not be needed very often, if at all, due to
the _<i>_nx()</i> function. The type of variable
substitution used in other gettext libraries (using
sprintf-like sybols, like <tt>%s</tt> or <tt>%1</tt>)
sometimes required context. For a (bad) example of this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    printf (__np(&quot;[count] files have been deleted&quot;,
                &quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;,
                &quot;%s files have been deleted.\n&quot;,
                $num_files),
            $num_files);</pre>



<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
The above usage is discouraged. Just use the _<i>_nx()</i>
call, which provides inline context via the key names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl-perl 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>__npx <small>MSGCTXT, MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT, VAR1</small> =&gt; <small>VAL1,
VAR2</small> =&gt; <small>VAL2, <br>
...</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is provided for
comleteness. It adds the variable interpolation into the
string to the previous method, _<i>_np()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
usage would be like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print __nx (&quot;Files being permenantly removed&quot;,
                &quot;One file has been deleted.\n&quot;,
                &quot;{count} files have been deleted.\n&quot;,
                $num_files,
                count =&gt; $num_files);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I cannot think
of any situations requiring this, but we can easily support
it, so here it is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl-perl 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>N__ ( <small>ARG1, ARG2,
...</small> )</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A no-op function that simply
echoes its arguments to the caller. Take the following piece
of Perl:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my @options = (
        &quot;Open&quot;,
        &quot;Save&quot;,
        &quot;Save As&quot;,
    );
    ...
    my $option = $options[1];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Now say that
you want to have this translatable. You could sometimes
simply do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my @options = (
        __&quot;Open&quot;,
        __&quot;Save&quot;,
        __&quot;Save As&quot;,
    );
    ...
    my $option = $options[1];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But often times
this will not be what you want, for example when you also
need the unmodified original string. Sometimes it may not
even work, for example, when the preferred user language is
not yet determined at the time that the list is
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In these cases
you would write:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my @options = (
        N__&quot;Open&quot;,
        N__&quot;Save&quot;,
        N__&quot;Save As&quot;,
    );
    ...
    my $option = __($options[1]);
    # or: my $option = dgettext ('my&minus;domain', $options[1]);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Now all the
strings in <tt>@options</tt> will be left alone, since N__()
returns its arguments (one ore more) unmodified.
Nevertheless, the string extractor will be able to recognize
the strings as being translatable. And you can still get the
translation later by passing the variable instead of the
string to one of the above translation functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>N__n ( <small>MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT</small> )</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Does exactly the same as N__().
You will use this form if you have to mark the strings as
having plural forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>N__p ( <small>MSGCTXT,
MSGID</small> )</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Marks
<b><small>MSGID</small></b> as N__() does, but in the
context <b><small>MSGCTXT</small></b> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>N__np ( <small>MSGCTXT,
MSGID, MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT</small> )</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Marks
<b><small>MSGID</small></b> as N_<i>_n()</i> does, but in
the context <b><small>MSGCTXT</small></b> . =back</p>

<h2>EXPORTED VARIABLES
<a name="EXPORTED VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The module
exports several variables into your namespace:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>%__</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A tied hash. Its keys are your original messages, the
values are their translations:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my $title = &quot;&lt;h1&gt;$__{'My Homepage'}&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is much
better for your translation team than</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my $title = __&quot;&lt;h1&gt;My Homepage&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
case the <small>HTML</small> code will make it into the
translation database and your translators have to be aware
of <small>HTML</small> syntax when translating strings.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning:</b>
Do <i>not</i> use this hash outside of double-quoted
strings! The code in the tied hash object relies on the
correct working of the function <i>caller()</i> (see
&quot;perldoc &minus;f caller&quot;), and this function will
report incorrect results if the tied hash value is the
argument to a function from another package, for
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  my $result = Other::Package::do_it ($__{'Some string'});</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The tied hash
code will see &quot;Other::Package&quot; as the calling
package, instead of your own package. Consequently it will
look up the message in the wrong text domain. There is no
workaround for this bug. Therefore:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Never use the
tied hash interpolated strings!</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$__</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="63%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference to

<td width="20%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">     my $title = &quot;&lt;h1&gt;$__&minus;&gt;{'My Homepage'}&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;;</pre>


<h2>PERFORMANCE
<a name="PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Message
translation can be a time-consuming task. Take this little
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1: use Locale::TextDomain ('my&minus;domain');
    2: use POSIX (:locale_h);
    3:
    4: setlocale (LC_ALL, '');
    5: print __&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
usually be quite fast, but in pathological cases it may run
for several seconds. A worst-case scenario would be a
Chinese user at a terminal that understands the codeset
Big5&minus;HKSCS. Your translator for Chinese has however
chosen to encode the translations in the codeset EUC-TW.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What will
happen at run-time? First, the library will search and load
a (maybe large) message catalog for your textdomain
&rsquo;my&minus;domain&rsquo;. Then it will look up the
translation for &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;, it will find
that it is encoded in EUC-TW. Since that differs from the
output codeset Big5&minus;HKSCS, it will first load a
conversion table containing several ten-thousands of
codepoints for EUC-TW, then it does the same with the
smaller, but still very large conversion table for
Big5&minus;HKSCS, it will convert the translation on the fly
from EUC-TW into Big5&minus;HKSCS, and finally it will
return the converted translation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A worst-case
scenario but realistic. And for these five lines of codes,
there is not much you can do to make it any faster. You
should understand, however, <i>when</i> the different steps
will take place, so that you can arrange your code for
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You have
learned in the section &quot;
<small>DESCRIPTION&quot;</small> that line 1 is responsible
for locating your message database. However, the
<i>use()</i> will do nothing more than remembering your
settings. It will not search any directories, it will not
load any catalogs or conversion tables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Somewhere in
your code you will always have a call to
<i>POSIX::setlocale()</i>, and the performance of this call
may be time-consuming, depending on the architecture of your
system. On some systems, this will consume very little time,
on others it will only consume a considerable amount of time
for the first call, and on others it may always be
time-consuming. Since you cannot know, how
<i>setlocale()</i> is implemented on the target system, you
should reduce the calls to <i>setlocale()</i> to a
minimum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 5 requests
the translation for your string. Only now, the library will
actually load the message catalog, and only now will it load
eventually needed conversion tables. And from now on, all
this information will be cached in memory. This strategy is
used throughout libintl-perl, and you may describe it as
&rsquo;load&minus;on&minus;first&minus;access&rsquo;.
Getting the next translation will consume very little
resources.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However,
although the translation retrieval is somewhat obfuscated by
an operator-like function call, it is still a function call,
and in fact it even involves a chain of function calls.
Consequently, the following example is probably bad
practice:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    foreach (1 .. 100_000) {
        print __&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
introduces a lot of overhead into your program. Better do
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $string = __&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
    foreach (1 .. 100_000) {
        print $string;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The translation
will never change, there is no need to retrieve it over and
over again. Although libintl-perl will of course cache the
translation read from the file system, you can still avoid
the overhead for the function calls.</p>
