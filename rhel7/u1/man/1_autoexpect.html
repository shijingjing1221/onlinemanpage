<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
watches you interacting with another program and creates an
Expect script that reproduces your interactions. For
straightline scripts, autoexpect saves substantial time over
writing scripts by hand. Even if you are an Expect expert,
you will find it convenient to use autoexpect to automate
the more mindless parts of interactions. It is much easier
to cut/paste hunks of autoexpect scripts together than to
write them from scratch. And if you are a beginner, you may
be able to get away with learning nothing more about Expect
than how to call autoexpect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simplest
way to use autoexpect is to call it from the command line
with no arguments. For example:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>% autoexpect</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
autoexpect spawns a shell for you. Given a program name and
arguments, autoexpect spawns that program. For example:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>% autoexpect ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once your
spawned program is running, interact normally. When you have
exited the shell (or program that you specified), autoexpect
will create a new script for you. By default, autoexpect
writes the new script to &quot;script.exp&quot;. You can
override this with the &minus;f flag followed by a new
script name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example runs &quot;ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov&quot; and stores the
resulting Expect script in the file &quot;nist&quot;.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>% autoexpect &minus;f nist ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to understand that autoexpect does not guarantee a working
script because it necessarily has to guess about certain
things &minus; and occasionally it guesses wrong. However,
it is usually very easy to identify and fix these problems.
The typical problems are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p>Timing. A surprisingly large number of programs (rn,
ksh, zsh, telnet, etc.) and devices (e.g., modems) ignore
keystrokes that arrive &quot;too quickly&quot; after
prompts. If you find your new script hanging up at one spot,
try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">You can force
this behavior throughout by overriding the variable
&quot;force_conservative&quot; near the beginning of the
generated script. This &quot;conservative&quot; mode makes
autoexpect automatically pause briefly (one tenth of a
second) before sending each character. This pacifies every
program I know of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">This
conservative mode is useful if you just want to quickly
reassure yourself that the problem is a timing one (or if
you really don&rsquo;t care about how fast the script runs).
This same mode can be forced before script generation by
using the &minus;c flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">Fortunately,
these timing spots are rare. For example, telnet ignores
characters only after entering its escape sequence. Modems
only ignore characters immediately after connecting to them
for the first time. A few programs exhibit this behavior all
the time but typically have a switch to disable it. For
example, rn&rsquo;s &minus;T flag disables this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example starts autoexpect in conservative mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;c</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;C
flag defines a key to toggle conservative mode. The
following example starts autoexpect (in non-conservative
mode) with ^L as the toggle. (Note that the ^L is entered
literally - i.e., enter a real control-L).</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;C ^L</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example starts autoexpect in conservative mode with ^L as
the toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;c &minus;C ^L</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Echoing. Many program echo
characters. For example, if you type &quot;more&quot; to a
shell, what autoexpect actually sees is:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">you typed
&rsquo;m&rsquo;,</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>computer typed &rsquo;m&rsquo;,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>you typed &rsquo;o&rsquo;,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>computer typed &rsquo;o&rsquo;,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>you typed &rsquo;r&rsquo;,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>computer typed &rsquo;r&rsquo;,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>...</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">Without
specific knowledge of the program, it is impossible to know
if you are waiting to see each character echoed before
typing the next. If autoexpect sees characters being echoed,
it assumes that it can send them all as a group rather than
interleaving them the way they originally appeared. This
makes the script more pleasant to read. However, it could
conceivably be incorrect if you really had to wait to see
each character echoed.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="72%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change. Autoexpect records every
character from the interaction in the script. This is
desirable because it gives you the ability to make
judgements about what is important and what can be replaced
with a pattern match.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you use commands whose output differs from run to
run, the generated scripts are not going to be correct. For
example, the &quot;date&quot; command always produces
different output. So using the date command while running
autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script that will
require editing in order for it to work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;p
flag puts autoexpect into &quot;prompt mode&quot;. In this
mode, autoexpect will only look for the the last line of
program output &minus; which is usually the prompt. This
handles the date problem (see above) and most others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example starts autoexpect in prompt mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;p</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;P
flag defines a key to toggle prompt mode. The following
example starts autoexpect (in non-prompt mode) with ^P as
the toggle. Note that the ^P is entered literally - i.e.,
enter a real control-P.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;P ^P</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example starts autoexpect in prompt mode with ^P as the
toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;p &minus;P ^P</p>

<h2>OTHER FLAGS
<a name="OTHER FLAGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;quiet</b> flag disables informational messages
produced by autoexpect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;Q</b> flag names a quote character which can be
used to enter characters that autoexpect would otherwise
consume because they are used as toggles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example shows a number of flags with quote used to provide a
way of entering the toggles literally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">autoexpect
&minus;P ^P &minus;C ^L &minus;Q ^Q</p>

<h2>STYLE
<a name="STYLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I don&rsquo;t
know if there is a &quot;style&quot; for Expect programs but
autoexpect should definitely not be held up as any model of
style. For example, autoexpect uses features of Expect that
are intended specifically for computer-generated scripting.
So don&rsquo;t try to faithfully write scripts that appear
as if they were generated by autoexpect. This is not
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, autoexpect scripts do show some worthwhile things. For
example, you can see how any string must be quoted in order
to use it in a Tcl script simply by running the strings
through autoexpect.</p>
