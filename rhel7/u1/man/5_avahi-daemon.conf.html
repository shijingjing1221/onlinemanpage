<h2>DESCRIPTION

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>avahi-daemon.conf</i></b>
is the configuration file for avahi-daemon.</p>

<h2>SECTION [SERVER]
<a name="SECTION [SERVER]"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>host-name=</b>
Set the host name avahi-daemon tries to register on the LAN.
<br>
If omited defaults to the system host name as set with the
<br>
sethostname() system call. <b><br>
domain-name=</b> Set the default domain name avahi-daemon
tries to register <br>
its host name and services on the LAN in. If omitted
defaults to <br>
&quot;.local&quot;. <b><br>
browse-domains=</b> Set a comma separated list of browsing
domains (in <br>
addition to the default one and those announced inside the
default <br>
browsing domain). Please note that the user may specify
additional <br>
browsing domains on the client side, either by setting <br>
$AVAHI_BROWSE_DOMAINS to a list of colon separated domains
or by adding <br>
them to the XDG config file
<i>~/.config/avahi/browse-domains</i> (separated <br>
by newlines). <b><br>
use-ipv4=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;no&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon will not use IPv4 sockets. Default is
&quot;yes&quot;. <b><br>
use-ipv6=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;no&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon will not use IPv6 sockets. Default is
&quot;yes&quot;. <b><br>
allow-interfaces=</b> Set a comma separated list of allowed
network <br>
interfaces that should be used by the avahi-daemon. Traffic
on other <br>
interfaces will be ignored. If set to an empty list all
local <br>
interfaces except loopback and point-to-point will be used.
<b><br>
deny-interfaces=</b> Set a comma separated list of network
interfaces that <br>
should be ignored by avahi-daemon. Other not specified
interfaces will <br>
be used, unless <b>allow-interfaces=</b> is set. This option
takes precedence <br>
over <b>allow-interfaces=</b>. <b><br>
check-response-ttl=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot;, an additional security check is activated:
incoming IP packets <br>
will be ignored unless the IP TTL is 255. Earlier mDNS
specifications <br>
required this check. Since this feature may be incompatible
with newer <br>
implementations of mDNS it defaults to &quot;no&quot;. On
the other hand it <br>
provides extra security. <b><br>
use-iff-running=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon monitors the IFF_RUNNING flag bit which is used
by some <br>
(modern) network drivers to tell user space if a network
cable is <br>
plugged in (in case of copper ethernet), or the network card
is <br>
associated with some kind of network (in case of WLAN). If
IFF_RUNNING <br>
is set avahi-daemon will automatically announce its services
on that <br>
network. Unfortunately far too many network drivers do not
support this <br>
flag or support it in a broken way. Therefore this option
defaults to <br>
&quot;no&quot;. <b><br>
enable-dbus=</b> Takes either &quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;no&quot; or &quot;warn&quot;. If set to
&quot;yes&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon connects to D-Bus, offering an object oriented
client API. <br>
It is only available if Avahi has been compiled with
<b>--enable-dbus</b> in <br>
which case it defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. &quot;warn&quot;
behaves like &quot;yes&quot;, but the <br>
daemon starts up even when it fails to connect to a D-Bus
daemon. In <br>
addition, if the connection to the D-Bus daemon is
terminated we try to <br>
reconnect. (Unless we are in a chroot() environment where
this <br>
definitely will fail.) <b><br>
disallow-other-stacks=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; no other process is allowed to bind to UDP
port 5353. This <br>
effectively impedes other mDNS stacks from running on the
host. Use <br>
this as a security measure to make sure that only Avahi is
responsible <br>
for mDNS traffic. Please note that we do not recommend
running multiple <br>
mDNS stacks on the same host simultaneously. This hampers
reliability <br>
and is a waste of resources. However, to not annoy people
this option <br>
defaults to &quot;no&quot;. <b><br>
allow-point-to-point=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will make use of interfaces
with the POINTOPOINT <br>
flag set. This option defaults to &quot;no&quot; as it might
make mDNS unreliable <br>
due to usually large latencies with such links and opens a
potential <br>
security hole by allowing mDNS access from Internet
connections. Use <br>
with care and YMMV! <b><br>
cache-entries-max=</b> Takes an unsigned integer specifying
how many <br>
resource records are cached per interface. Bigger values
allow mDNS <br>
work correctly in large LANs but also increase memory
consumption. <b><br>
clients-max=</b> Takes an unsigned integer. The maximum
number of <br>
concurrent D-Bus clients allowed. If the maximum number is
reached <br>
further clients will be refused until at least one existing
client <br>
disconnects. <b><br>
objects-per-client-max=</b> Takes an unsigned integer. The
maximum number <br>
of objects (entry groups, browsers, resolvers) that may be
registered <br>
per D-Bus client at a time. If the maximum number is reached
further <br>
object creation will be refused until at least one object is
freed. <b><br>
entries-per-entry-group-max=</b> Takes an unsigned integer.
The maximum <br>
number of entries (resource records) per entry group
registered by a <br>
D-Bus client at a time. If the maximum number is reached
further <br>
resource records may not be added to an entry group. <b><br>
ratelimit-interval-usec=</b> Takes an unsigned integer. Sets
the <br>
per-interface packet rate-limiting interval parameter.
Together with <b><br>
ratelimit-burst=</b> this may be used to control the maximum
number of <br>
packets Avahi will generated in a specific period of time on
an <br>
interface. <b><br>
ratelimit-burst=</b> Takes an unsigned integer. Sets the
per-interface <br>
packet rate-limiting burst parameter. Together with <b><br>
ratelimit-interval-usec=</b> this may be used to control the
maximum number <br>
of packets Avahi will generated in a specific period of time
on an <br>
interface.</p>

<h2>SECTION [WIDE-AREA]
<a name="SECTION [WIDE-AREA]"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>enable-wide-area=</b>
Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).
Enable <br>
wide-area DNS-SD, aka DNS-SD over unicast DNS. If this is
enabled only <br>
domains ending in .local will be resolved on mDNS, all other
domains <br>
are resolved via unicast DNS. If you want to maintain
multiple <br>
different multicast DNS domains even with this option
enabled we <br>
encourage you to use subdomains of .local, such as
&quot;kitchen.local&quot;. <br>
This option defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<h2>SECTION [PUBLISH]
<a name="SECTION [PUBLISH]"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>disable-publishing=</b>
Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).
If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot;, no record will be published by Avahi, not
even address records <br>
for the local host. Avahi will be started in a querying-only
mode. Use <br>
this is a security measure. This option defaults to
&quot;no&quot; <b><br>
disable-user-service-publishing=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). <br>
If set to &quot;yes&quot;, Avahi will still publish address
records and suchlike <br>
but will not allow user applications to publish services.
Use this is a <br>
security measure. This option defaults to &quot;no&quot;
<b><br>
add-service-cookie=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; an implicit TXT entry will be added to all
locally registered <br>
services, containing a cookie value which is chosen randomly
on daemon <br>
startup. This can be used to detect if two services on two
different <br>
interfaces/protocols are actually identical. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;. <b><br>
publish-addresses=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will register mDNS address
records for all local IP <br>
addresses. Unless you want to use avahi-daemon exclusively
for browsing <br>
it&rsquo;s recommended to enable this. If you plan to
register local services <br>
you need to enable this option. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
<b><br>
publish-hinfo=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon will register an mDNS HINFO record on all
interfaces which <br>
contains information about the local operating system and
CPU, which <br>
might be useful for administrative purposes. This is
recommended by the <br>
mDNS specification but not required. For the sake of privacy
you might <br>
choose to disable this feature. Defaults to &quot;yes.&quot;
<b><br>
publish-workstation=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will register a service of type
&quot;_workstation._tcp&quot; <br>
on the local LAN. This might be useful for administrative
purposes <br>
(i.e. browse for all PCs on the LAN), but is not required or
<br>
recommended by any specification. Newer MacOS X releases
register a <br>
service of this type. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. <b><br>
publish-domain=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; <br>
avahi-daemon will announce the locally used domain name (see
above) for <br>
browsing by other hosts. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
<b><br>
publish-dns-servers=</b> Takes a comma separated list of IP
addresses for <br>
unicast DNS servers. You can use this to announce unicast
DNS servers <br>
via mDNS. When used in conjunction with avahi-dnsconfd on
the client <br>
side this allows DHCP-like configuration of unicast DNS
servers. <b><br>
publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). <br>
If set to &quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish the
unicast DNS servers <br>
specified in <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> in addition to those
specified with <b><br>
publish-dns-servers</b>. Send avahi-daemon a SIGHUP to have
it reload this <br>
file. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;. <b><br>
publish-aaaa-on-ipv4=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish an IPv6 AAAA
record via IPv4, i.e. the <br>
local IPv6 addresses can be resolved using an IPv4
transport. Only <br>
useful when IPv4 is enabled with <b>use-ipv4=true</b>.
Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. <b><br>
publish-a-on-ipv6=</b> Takes a boolean value
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will publish an IPv4 A record
via IPv6, i.e. the <br>
local IPv4 addresses can be resolved using an IPv6
transport. Only <br>
useful when IPv6 is enabled with <b>use-ipv6=true</b>.
Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<h2>SECTION [REFLECTOR]
<a name="SECTION [REFLECTOR]"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>enable-reflector=</b>
Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).
If set to <br>
&quot;yes&quot; avahi-daemon will reflect incoming mDNS
requests to all local <br>
network interfaces, effectively allowing clients to browse
mDNS/DNS-SD <br>
services on all networks connected to the gateway. The
gateway is <br>
somewhat intelligent and should work with all kinds of mDNS
traffic, <br>
though some functionality is lost (specifically the unicast
reply bit, <br>
which is used rarely anyway). Make sure to not run multiple
reflectors <br>
between the same networks, this might cause them to play
Ping Pong with <br>
mDNS packets. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;. <b><br>
reflect-ipv=</b> Takes a boolean value (&quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;). If set to &quot;yes&quot; and <b><br>
enable-reflector</b> is enabled, avahi-daemon will forward
mDNS traffic <br>
between IPv4 and IPv6, which is usually not recommended.
Defaults to <br>
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<h2>SECTION [RLIMITS]
<a name="SECTION [RLIMITS]"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section is
used to define system resource limits for the daemon. See
<b>setrlimit(2)</b> for more information. If any of the
options is not specified in the configuration file,
avahi-daemon does not change it from the system defaults.
<b><br>
rlimit-as=</b> Value in bytes for RLIMIT_AS (maximum size of
the process&rsquo;s <br>
virtual memory). Sensible values are heavily system
dependent. <b><br>
rlimit-core=</b> Value in bytes for RLIMIT_CORE (maximum
core file size). <br>
Unless you want to debug avahi-daemon, it is safe to set
this to 0. <b><br>
rlimit-data=</b> Value in bytes for RLIMIT_DATA (maximum
size of the <br>
process&rsquo;s data segment). Sensible values are heavily
system dependent. <b><br>
rlimit-fsize=</b> Value for RLIMIT_FSIZE (maximum size of
files the process <br>
may create). Since avahi-daemon shouldn&rsquo;t write any
files to disk, it <br>
is safe to set this to 0. <b><br>
rlimit-nofile=</b> Value for RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file
descriptors). <br>
avahi-daemon shouldn&rsquo;t need more than 15 to 20 open
file descriptors <br>
concurrently. <b><br>
rlimit-stack=</b> Value in bytes for RLIMIT_STACK (maximum
size of the <br>
process stack). Sensible values are heavily system
dependent. <b><br>
rlimit-nproc=</b> Value for RLIMIT_NPROC (number of process
of user). <br>
avahi-daemon forks of a helper process on systems where
<b>chroot(2)</b> is <br>
available. Therefore this value should not be set below
2.</p>
