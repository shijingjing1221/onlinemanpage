<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">version::Internals
&minus; Perl extension for Version Objects</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Overloaded
version objects for all modern versions of Perl. This
documents the internal data representation and underlying
code for version.pm. See <i>version.pod</i> for daily usage.
This document is only useful for users interested in the
gory details.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A VERSION?
<a name="WHAT IS A VERSION?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
purposes of this module, a version &quot;number&quot; is a
sequence of positive integer values separated by one or more
decimal points and optionally a single underscore. This
corresponds to what Perl itself uses for a version, as well
as extending the &quot;version as number&quot; that is
discussed in the various editions of the Camel book.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
actually two distinct kinds of version objects: <br>
Decimal Versions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any version which &quot;looks
like a number&quot;, see &quot;Decimal Versions&quot;. This
also includes versions with a single decimal point and a
single embedded underscore, see &quot;Alpha Versions&quot;,
even though these must be quoted to preserve the underscore
formatting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Dotted-Decimal Versions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Also referred to as
&quot;Dotted-Integer&quot;, these contains more than one
decimal point and may have an optional embedded underscore,
see Dotted-Decimal Versions. This is what is commonly used
in most open source software as the &quot;external&quot;
version (the one used as part of the tag or tarfile name). A
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; character is now required and will
warn if it missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of these
methods will produce similar version objects, in that the
default stringification will yield the version &quot;Normal
Form&quot; only if required:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $v  = version&minus;&gt;new(1.002);     # 1.002, but compares like 1.2.0
  $v  = version&minus;&gt;new(1.002003);  # 1.002003
  $v2 = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.2.3&quot;);  # v1.2.3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In specific,
version numbers initialized as &quot;Decimal Versions&quot;
will stringify as they were originally created (i.e. the
same string that was passed to <tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt>.
Version numbers initialized as &quot;Dotted-Decimal
Versions&quot; will be stringified as &quot;Normal
Form&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Decimal
Versions</b> <br>
These correspond to historical versions of Perl itself prior
to 5.6.0, as well as all other modules which follow the
Camel rules for the <tt>$VERSION</tt> scalar. A Decimal
version is initialized with what looks like a floating point
number. Leading zeros <b>are</b> significant and trailing
zeros are implied so that a minimum of three places is
maintained between subversions. What this means is that any
subversion (digits to the right of the decimal place) that
contains less than three digits will have trailing zeros
added to make up the difference, but only for purposes of
comparison with other version objects. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">                                   # Prints     Equivalent to
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(      1.2);    # 1.2        v1.200.0
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(     1.02);    # 1.02       v1.20.0
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(    1.002);    # 1.002      v1.2.0
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(   1.0023);    # 1.0023     v1.2.300
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(  1.00203);    # 1.00203    v1.2.30
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.002003);    # 1.002003   v1.2.3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
preceding examples are true whether or not the input value
is quoted. The important feature is that the input value
contains only a single decimal. See also &quot;Alpha
Versions&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> As shown above, if your Decimal version
contains more than 3 significant digits after the decimal
place, it will be split on each multiple of 3, so 1.0003 is
equivalent to v1.0.300, due to the need to remain compatible
with Perl&rsquo;s own 5.005_03 == 5.5.30 interpretation. Any
trailing zeros are ignored for mathematical comparison
purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dotted-Decimal
Versions</b> <br>
These are the newest form of versions, and correspond to
Perl&rsquo;s own version style beginning with 5.6.0.
Starting with Perl 5.10.0, and most likely Perl 6, this is
likely to be the preferred form. This method normally
requires that the input parameter be quoted, although
Perl&rsquo;s after 5.8.1 can use v&minus;strings as a
special form of quoting, but this is highly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
&quot;Decimal Versions&quot;, Dotted-Decimal Versions have
more than a single decimal point, e.g.:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">                                   # Prints
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new( &quot;v1.200&quot;);    # v1.200.0
  $v = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.20.0&quot;);    # v1.20.0
  $v = qv(&quot;v1.2.3&quot;);               # v1.2.3
  $v = qv(&quot;1.2.3&quot;);                # v1.2.3
  $v = qv(&quot;1.20&quot;);                 # v1.20.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
Dotted-Decimal Versions permit the greatest amount of
freedom to specify a version, whereas Decimal Versions
enforce a certain uniformity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just like
&quot;Decimal Versions&quot;, Dotted-Decimal Versions can be
used as &quot;Alpha Versions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alpha
Versions</b> <br>
For module authors using <small>CPAN,</small> the convention
has been to note unstable releases with an underscore in the
version string. (See <small>CPAN</small> .) version.pm
follows this convention and alpha releases will test as
being newer than the more recent stable release, and less
than the next stable release. Only the last element may be
separated by an underscore:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  # Declaring
  use version 0.77; our $VERSION = version&minus;&gt;declare(&quot;v1.2_3&quot;);
  # Parsing
  $v1 = version&minus;&gt;parse(&quot;v1.2_3&quot;);
  $v1 = version&minus;&gt;parse(&quot;1.002_003&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
<b>must</b> quote the version when writing an alpha Decimal
version. The stringified form of Decimal versions will
always be the same string that was used to initialize the
version object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
Expressions for Version Parsing</b> <br>
A formalized definition of the legal forms for version
strings is included in the
<tt>&quot;version::regex&quot;</tt> class. Primitives are
included for common elements, although they are scoped to
the file so they are useful for reference purposes only.
There are two publicly accessible scalars that can be used
in other code (not exported): <br>
$version::LAX</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This regexp covers all of the
legal forms allowed under the current version string parser.
This is not to say that all of these forms are recommended,
and some of them can only be used when quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For dotted
decimals:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    v1.2
    1.2345.6
    v1.23_4</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is optional if two or more decimals appear.
If only a single decimal is included, then the leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is required to trigger the dotted-decimal
parsing. A leading zero is permitted, though not recommended
except when quoted, because of the risk that Perl will treat
the number as octal. A trailing underscore plus one or more
digits denotes an alpha or development release (and must be
quoted to be parsed properly).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For decimal
versions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    1
    1.2345
    1.2345_01</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">an integer
portion, an optional decimal point, and optionally one or
more digits to the right of the decimal are all required. A
trailing underscore is permitted and a leading zero is
permitted. Just like the lax dotted-decimal version, quoting
the values is required for alpha/development forms to be
parsed correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$version::STRICT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This regexp covers a much more
limited set of formats and constitutes the best practices
for initializing version objects. Whether you choose to
employ decimal or dotted-decimal for is a personal
preference however. <br>
v1.234.5</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">For dotted-decimal versions, a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; is required, with three or more
sub-versions of no more than three digits. A leading 0
(zero) before the first sub-version (in the above example,
&rsquo;1&rsquo;) is also prohibited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">2.3456</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">For decimal versions, an
integer portion (no leading 0), a decimal point, and one or
more digits to the right of the decimal are all
required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of the
provided scalars are already compiled as regular expressions
and do not contain either anchors or implicit groupings, so
they can be included in your own regular expressions freely.
For example, consider the following code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        ($pkg, $ver) =~ /
                ^[ \t]*
                use [ \t]+($PKGNAME)
                (?:[ \t]+($version::STRICT))?
                [ \t]*;
        /x;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This would
match a line of the form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        use Foo::Bar::Baz v1.2.3;       # legal only in Perl 5.8.1+</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<tt>$PKGNAME</tt> is another regular expression that defines
the legal forms for package names.</p>

<h2>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
<a name="IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Equivalence
between Decimal and Dotted-Decimal Versions</b> <br>
When Perl 5.6.0 was released, the decision was made to
provide a transformation between the old-style decimal
versions and new-style dotted-decimal versions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  5.6.0    == 5.006000
  5.005_04 == 5.5.40</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The floating
point number is taken and split first on the single decimal
place, then each group of three digits to the right of the
decimal makes up the next digit, and so on until the number
of significant digits is exhausted, <b>plus</b> enough
trailing zeros to reach the next multiple of three.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This was the
method that version.pm adopted as well. Some examples may be
helpful:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">                            equivalent
  decimal    zero&minus;padded    dotted&minus;decimal
  &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;    &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;    &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
  1.2        1.200          v1.200.0
  1.02       1.020          v1.20.0
  1.002      1.002          v1.2.0
  1.0023     1.002300       v1.2.300
  1.00203    1.002030       v1.2.30
  1.002003   1.002003       v1.2.3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Quoting
Rules</b> <br>
Because of the nature of the Perl parsing and tokenizing
routines, certain initialization values <b>must</b> be
quoted in order to correctly parse as the intended version,
especially when using the <tt>&quot;declare&quot;</tt> or
&quot;<i>qv()</i>&quot; methods. While you do not have to
quote decimal numbers when creating version objects, it is
always safe to quote <b>all</b> initial values when using
version.pm methods, as this will ensure that what you type
is what is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if you quote your initializer, then the quoted value that
goes <b>in</b> will be exactly what comes <b>out</b> when
your <tt>$VERSION</tt> is printed (stringified). If you do
not quote your value, Perl&rsquo;s normal numeric handling
comes into play and you may not get back what you were
expecting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use a
mathematic formula that resolves to a floating point number,
you are dependent on Perl&rsquo;s conversion routines to
yield the version you expect. You are pretty safe by
dividing by a power of 10, for example, but other operations
are not likely to be what you intend. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $VERSION = version&minus;&gt;new((qw$Revision: 1.4)[1]/10);
  print $VERSION;          # yields 0.14
  $V2 = version&minus;&gt;new(100/9); # Integer overflow in decimal number
  print $V2;               # yields something like 11.111.111.100</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.8.1 and
beyond are able to automatically quote v&minus;strings but
that is not possible in earlier versions of Perl. In other
words:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $version = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v2.5.4&quot;);  # legal in all versions of Perl
  $newvers = version&minus;&gt;new(v2.5.4);    # legal only in Perl &gt;= 5.8.1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What about
v&minus;strings?</b> <br>
There are two ways to enter v&minus;strings: a bare number
with two or more decimal points, or a bare number with one
or more decimal points and a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;
character (also bare). For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $vs1 = 1.2.3; # encoded as \1\2\3
  $vs2 = v1.2;  # encoded as \1\2</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
use of bare v&minus;strings to initialize version objects is
<b>strongly</b> discouraged in all circumstances. Also, bare
v&minus;strings are not completely supported in any version
of Perl prior to 5.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you insist
on using bare v&minus;strings with Perl &gt; 5.6.0, be aware
of the following limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1) For Perl
releases 5.6.0 through 5.8.0, the v&minus;string code merely
guesses, based on some characteristics of v&minus;strings.
You <b>must</b> use a three part version, e.g. 1.2.3 or
v1.2.3 in order for this heuristic to be successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2) For Perl
releases 5.8.1 and later, v&minus;strings have changed in
the Perl core to be magical, which means that the version.pm
code can automatically determine whether the v&minus;string
encoding was used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3) In all
cases, a version created using v&minus;strings will have a
stringified form that has a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;
character, for the simple reason that sometimes it is
impossible to tell whether one was present initially.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version
Object Internals</b> <br>
version.pm provides an overloaded version object that is
designed to both encapsulate the author&rsquo;s intended
<tt>$VERSION</tt> assignment as well as make it completely
natural to use those objects as if they were numbers (e.g.
for comparisons). To do this, a version object contains both
the original representation as typed by the author, as well
as a parsed representation to ease comparisons. Version
objects employ overload methods to simplify code that needs
to compare, print, etc the objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The internal
structure of version objects is a blessed hash with several
components:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    bless( {
      'original' =&gt; 'v1.2.3_4',
      'alpha' =&gt; 1,
      'qv' =&gt; 1,
      'version' =&gt; [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4
      ]
    }, 'version' );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">original</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A faithful representation of
the value used to initialize this version object. The only
time this will not be precisely the same characters that
exist in the source file is if a short dotted-decimal
version like v1.2 was used (in which case it will contain
&rsquo;v1.2&rsquo;). This form is
<b><small>STRONGLY</small></b> discouraged, in that it will
confuse you and your users.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>qv</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A boolean that denotes whether this is a decimal or
dotted-decimal version. See &quot;<i>is_qv()</i>&quot; in
version.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alpha</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A boolean that denotes whether
this is an alpha version. <small>NOTE:</small> that the
underscore can only appear in the last position. See
&quot;<i>is_alpha()</i>&quot; in version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">version</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An array of non-negative
integers that is used for comparison purposes with other
version objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Replacement
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small></b> <br>
In addition to the version objects, this modules also
replaces the core <small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> function
with one that uses version objects for its comparisons. The
return from this operator is always the stringified form as
a simple scalar (i.e. not an object), but the warning
message generated includes either the stringified form or
the normal form, depending on how it was called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  package Foo;
  $VERSION = 1.2;
  package Bar;
  $VERSION = &quot;v1.3.5&quot;; # works with all Perl's (since it is quoted)
  package main;
  use version;
  print $Foo::VERSION; # prints 1.2
  print $Bar::VERSION; # prints 1.003005
  eval &quot;use foo 10&quot;;
  print $@; # prints &quot;foo version 10 required...&quot;
  eval &quot;use foo 1.3.5; # work in Perl 5.6.1 or better
  print $@; # prints &quot;foo version 1.3.5 required...&quot;
  eval &quot;use bar 1.3.6&quot;;
  print $@; # prints &quot;bar version 1.3.6 required...&quot;
  eval &quot;use bar 1.004&quot;; # note Decimal version
  print $@; # prints &quot;bar version 1.004 required...&quot;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> This may mean that code which searches for a
specific string (to determine whether a given module is
available) may need to be changed. It is always better to
use the built-in comparison implicit in
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>,
rather than manually poking at
<tt>&quot;class&minus;&gt;VERSION&quot;</tt> and then doing
a comparison yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The replacement
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION,</small> when used as a function,
like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  print $module&minus;&gt;VERSION;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will also
exclusively return the stringified form. See
&quot;Stringification&quot; for more details.</p>

<h2>USAGE DETAILS
<a name="USAGE DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
modules that use version.pm</b> <br>
As much as possible, the version.pm module remains
compatible with all current code. However, if your module is
using a module that has defined <tt>$VERSION</tt> using the
version class, there are a couple of things to be aware of.
For purposes of discussion, we will assume that we have the
following module installed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  package Example;
  use version;  $VERSION = qv('1.2.2');
  ...module code here...
  1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Decimal versions always
work</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Code of the form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  use Example 1.002003;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will always
work correctly. The <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> will perform an
automatic <tt>$VERSION</tt> comparison using the floating
point number given as the first term after the module name
(e.g. above 1.002.003). In this case, the installed module
is too old for the requested line, so you would see an error
like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  Example version 1.002003 (v1.2.3) required&minus;&minus;this is only version 1.002002 (v1.2.2)...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Dotted-Decimal version work
sometimes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With Perl &gt;= 5.6.2, you can
also use a line like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  use Example 1.2.3;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and it will
again work (i.e. give the error message as above), even with
releases of Perl which do not normally support
v&minus;strings (see &quot;What about v&minus;strings?&quot;
above). This has to do with that fact that
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> only checks to see if the second
term <i>looks like a number</i> and passes that to the
replacement <small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> . This is not
true in Perl 5.005_04, however, so you are <b>strongly
encouraged</b> to always use a Decimal version in your code,
even for those versions of Perl which support the
Dotted-Decimal version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Object
Methods</b> <i><br>
new()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like many <small>OO</small>
interfaces, the <i>new()</i> method is used to initialize
version objects. If two arguments are passed to
<tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt>, the <b>second</b> one will be
used as if it were prefixed with &quot;v&quot;. This is to
support historical use of the <tt>&quot;qw&quot;</tt>
operator with the <small>CVS</small> variable
<tt>$Revision</tt>, which is automatically incremented by
<small>CVS</small> every time the file is committed to the
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
facilitate this feature, the following code can be
employed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $VERSION = version&minus;&gt;new(qw$Revision: 2.7 $);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and the version
object will be created as if the following code were
used:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $VERSION = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v2.7&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
the version will be automatically parsed out of the string,
and it will be quoted to preserve the meaning
<small>CVS</small> normally carries for versions. The
<small>CVS</small> <tt>$Revision</tt>$ increments
differently from Decimal versions (i.e. 1.10 follows 1.9),
so it must be handled as if it were a Dotted-Decimal
Version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new version
object can be created as a copy of an existing version
object, either as a class method:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $v1 = version&minus;&gt;new(12.3);
  $v2 = version&minus;&gt;new($v1);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or as an object
method:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $v1 = version&minus;&gt;new(12.3);
  $v2 = $v1&minus;&gt;new(12.3);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and in each
case, <tt>$v1</tt> and <tt>$v2</tt> will be identical.
<small>NOTE:</small> if you create a new object using an
existing object like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $v2 = $v1&minus;&gt;new();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the new object
<b>will not</b> be a clone of the existing object. In the
example case, <tt>$v2</tt> will be an empty object of the
same type as <tt>$v1</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>qv()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An alternate way to create a
new version object is through the exported <i>qv()</i> sub.
This is not strictly like other q? operators (like qq, qw),
in that the only delimiters supported are parentheses (or
spaces). It is the best way to initialize a short version
without triggering the floating point interpretation. For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $v1 = qv(1.2);         # v1.2.0
  $v2 = qv(&quot;1.2&quot;);       # also v1.2.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
either a bare number or a quoted string can usually be used
interchangeably, except in the case of a trailing zero,
which must be quoted to be converted properly. For this
reason, it is strongly recommended that all initializers to
<i>qv()</i> be quoted strings instead of bare numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent the
<tt>&quot;qv()&quot;</tt> function from being exported to
the caller&rsquo;s namespace, either use version with a null
parameter:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  use version ();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or just require
version, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  require version;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Both methods
will prevent the <i>import()</i> method from firing and
exporting the <tt>&quot;qv()&quot;</tt> sub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
subsequent examples, the following three objects will be
used:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ver   = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2.3.4&quot;); # see &quot;Quoting Rules&quot;
  $alpha = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2.3_4&quot;); # see &quot;Alpha Versions&quot;
  $nver  = version&minus;&gt;new(1.002);     # see &quot;Decimal Versions&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Normal Form</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For any version object which is
initialized with multiple decimal places (either quoted or
if possible v&minus;string), or initialized using the
<i>qv()</i> operator, the stringified representation is
returned in a normalized or reduced form (no extraneous
zeros), and with a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  print $ver&minus;&gt;normal;         # prints as v1.2.3.4
  print $ver&minus;&gt;stringify;      # ditto
  print $ver;                 # ditto
  print $nver&minus;&gt;normal;        # prints as v1.2.0
  print $nver&minus;&gt;stringify;     # prints as 1.002,
                              # see &quot;Stringification&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
preserve the meaning of the processed version, the
normalized representation will always contain at least three
sub terms. In other words, the following is guaranteed to
always be true:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  my $newver = version&minus;&gt;new($ver&minus;&gt;stringify);
  if ($newver eq $ver ) # always true
    {...}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Numification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Although all mathematical
operations on version objects are forbidden by default, it
is possible to retrieve a number which corresponds to the
version object through the use of the
<tt>$obj</tt>&minus;&gt;numify method. For formatting
purposes, when displaying a number which corresponds a
version object, all sub versions are assumed to have three
decimal places. So for example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  print $ver&minus;&gt;numify;         # prints 1.002003004
  print $nver&minus;&gt;numify;        # prints 1.002</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
stringification operator, there is never any need to append
trailing zeros to preserve the correct version value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Stringification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default stringification for
version objects returns exactly the same string as was used
to create it, whether you used <tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;qv()&quot;</tt>, with one exception. The sole
exception is if the object was created using
<tt>&quot;qv()&quot;</tt> and the initializer did not have
two decimal places or a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; (both
optional), then the stringified form will have a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; prepended, in order to support round-trip
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  Initialized as          Stringifies to
  ==============          ==============
  version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2&quot;)       1.2
  version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.2&quot;)     v1.2
  qv(&quot;1.2.3&quot;)               1.2.3
  qv(&quot;v1.3.5&quot;)             v1.3.5
  qv(&quot;1.2&quot;)                v1.2   ### exceptional case</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See also
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> , as this also returns the
stringified form when used as a class method.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> There is one exceptional cases shown in the
above table where the &quot;initializer&quot; is not
stringwise equivalent to the stringified representation. If
you use the <tt>&quot;qv&quot;</tt>() operator on a version
without a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; <b>and</b> with only a
single decimal place, the stringified output will have a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;, to preserve the sense. See the
&quot;<i>qv()</i>&quot; operator for more details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE 2:</small> Attempting to bypass the normal
stringification rules by manually applying <i>numify()</i>
and <i>normal()</i> will sometimes yield surprising
results:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  print version&minus;&gt;new(version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.0&quot;)&minus;&gt;numify)&minus;&gt;normal; # v1.0.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
this is that the <i>numify()</i> operator will turn
&quot;v1.0&quot; into the equivalent string
&quot;1.000000&quot;. Forcing the outer version object to
<i>normal()</i> form will display the mathematically
equivalent &quot;v1.0.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As the example
in &quot;<i>new()</i>&quot; shows, you can always create a
copy of an existing version object with the same value by
the very compact:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $v2 = $v1&minus;&gt;new($v1);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and be assured
that both <tt>$v1</tt> and <tt>$v2</tt> will be completely
equivalent, down to the same internal representation as well
as stringification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Comparison operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Both <tt>&quot;cmp&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</tt> operators perform the
same comparison between terms (upgrading to a version object
automatically). Perl automatically generates all of the
other comparison operators based on those two. In addition
to the obvious equalities listed below, appending a single
trailing 0 term does not change the value of a version for
comparison purposes. In other words &quot;v1.2&quot; and
&quot;1.2.0&quot; will compare as identical.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the following relations hold:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  As Number        As String           Truth Value
  &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;    &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;    &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
  $ver &gt;  1.0      $ver gt &quot;1.0&quot;       true
  $ver &lt;  2.5      $ver lt             true
  $ver != 1.3      $ver ne &quot;1.3&quot;       true
  $ver == 1.2      $ver eq &quot;1.2&quot;       false
  $ver == 1.2.3.4  $ver eq &quot;1.2.3.4&quot;   see discussion below</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is probably
best to chose either the Decimal notation or the string
notation and stick with it, to reduce confusion. Perl6
version objects <b>may</b> only support Decimal comparisons.
See also &quot;Quoting Rules&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>WARNING:</small>
Comparing version with unequal numbers of decimal points
(whether explicitly or implicitly initialized), may yield
unexpected results at first glance. For example, the
following inequalities hold:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  version&minus;&gt;new(0.96)     &gt; version&minus;&gt;new(0.95); # 0.960.0 &gt; 0.950.0
  version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;0.96.1&quot;) &lt; version&minus;&gt;new(0.95); # 0.096.1 &lt; 0.950.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For this
reason, it is best to use either exclusively &quot;Decimal
Versions&quot; or &quot;Dotted-Decimal Versions&quot; with
multiple decimal points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Logical Operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you need to test whether a
version object has been initialized, you can simply test it
directly:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $vobj = version&minus;&gt;new($something);
  if ( $vobj )   # true only if $something was non&minus;blank</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
test whether a version object is an alpha version, for
example to prevent the use of some feature not present in
the main release:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $vobj = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2_3&quot;); # MUST QUOTE
  ...later...
  if ( $vobj&minus;&gt;is_alpha )       # True</pre>
