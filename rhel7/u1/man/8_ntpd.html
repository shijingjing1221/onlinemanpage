<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>ntpd</b>
program is an operating system daemon that synchronises the
system clock with remote NTP time servers or local reference
clocks. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time
Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility
with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2,
as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. The
program can operate in any of several modes, as described on
the Association Management page, and with both symmetric key
and public key cryptography, as described on the
Authentication Options page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>ntpd</b>
program ordinarily requires a configuration file as
desccribe on the Configuration Commands and Options
collection above. However a client can discover remote
servers and configure them automatically. This makes it
possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without
specifying configuration details specific to the local
environment. Further details are on the Automatic Server
Discovery page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the NTP
software distribution has been compiled and installed and
the configuration file constructed, the next step is to
verify correct operation and fix any bugs that may result.
Usually, the command line that starts the daemon is included
in the system startup file, so it is executed only at system
boot time; however, the daemon can be stopped and restarted
from root at any time. Once started, the daemon will begin
sending and receiving messages, as specified in the
configuration file.</p>

<h2>SETTING THE TIME AND FREQUENCY
<a name="SETTING THE TIME AND FREQUENCY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>ntpd</b>
program operates by exchanging messages with one or more
servers at designated intervals ranging from about one
minute to about 17 minutes. When started, the program
requires several exchanges while the algorithms accumulate
and groom the data before setting the clock. The initial
delay to set the clock can be reduced using options on the
Server Options page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most compters
today incorporate a time-of-year (TOY) chip to maintain the
time during periods when the power is off. When the machine
is booted, the chip is used to initialize the operating
system time. In case there is no TOY chip or the TOY time is
more than 1000 s from the server time, <b>ntpd</b> assumes
something must be terribly wrong and exits with a panic
message to the system operator. With the <b>-g</b> option
the clock will be initially set to the server time
regardless of the chip time. However, once the clock has
been set, an error greater than 1000 s will cause
<b>ntpd</b> to exit anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under ordinary
conditions, <b>ntpd</b> slews the clock so that the time is
effectively continuous and never runs backwards. If due to
extreme network congestion an error spike exceeds the
<i>step threshold</i>, by default 128 ms, the spike is
discarded. However, if the error persists for more than the
<i>stepout threshold</i>, by default 900 s, the system clock
is stepped to the correct value. In practice the need for a
step has is extremely rare and almost always the result of a
hardware failure. With the <b>-x</b> option the step
threshold is increased to 600 s. Other options are available
using the <b>tinker</b> command on the Miscellaneous Options
page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The issues
should be carefully considered before using these options.
The maximum slew rate possible is limited to 500
parts-per-million (PPM) by the Unix kernel. As a result, the
clock can take 2000 s for each second the clock is outside
the acceptable range. During this interval the clock will
not be consistent with any other network clock and the
system cannot be used for distributed applications that
require correctly synchronized network time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The frequency
file, usually called <b>ntp.drift</b>, contains the latest
estimate of clock frequency. If this file does not exist
when <b>ntpd</b> is started, it enters a special mode
designed to measure the particular frequency directly. The
measurement takes 15 minutes, after which the frequency is
set and <b>ntpd</b> resumes normal mode where the time and
frequency are continuously adjusted. The frequency file is
updated at intervals of an hour or more depending on the
measured clock stability.</p>

<h2>OPERATING MODES
<a name="OPERATING MODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>ntpd</b>
program normally operates continuously while adjusting the
time and frequency, but in some cases it may not be
practical to run it continuously. With the <b>-q</b> option
<b>ntpd</b> operates as in continous mode, but exits just
after setting the clock for the first time with the
configured servers. Most applications will probably want to
specify the <b>iburst</b> option with the <b>server</b>
command. With this option a volley of messages is exchanged
to groom the data and set the clock in about 10 s. If
nothing is heard after a few minutes, the daemon times out
and exits.</p>

<h2>POLL INTERVAL CONTROL
<a name="POLL INTERVAL CONTROL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NTP uses an
intricate heuristic algorithm to automatically control the
poll interval for maximum accuracy consistent with minimum
network overhead. The algorithm measures the incidental
offset and jitter to determine the best poll interval. When
<b>ntpd</b> starts, the interval is the default minimum 64
s. Under normal conditions when the clock discipline has
stabilized, the interval increases in steps to the default
maximum 1024 s. In addition, should a server become
unreachable after some time, the interval increases in steps
to the maximum in order to reduce network overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
poll interval range is suitable for most conditions, but can
be changed using options on the Server Options and
Miscellaneous Options pages. However, when using maximum
intervals much larger than the default, the residual clock
frequency error must be small enough for the discipline loop
to capture and correct. The capture range is 500 PPM with a
64-s interval decreasing by a factor of two for each
interval doubling. At a 36-hr interval, for example, the
capture range is only 0.24 PPM.</p>

<h2>THE HUFF-N&rsquo;-PUFF FILTER
<a name="THE HUFF-N&rsquo;-PUFF FILTER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In scenarios
where a considerable amount of data are to be downloaded or
uploaded over telephone modems, timekeeping quality can be
seriously degraded. This occurs because the differential
delays on the two directions of transmission can be quite
large. In many cases the apparent time errors are so large
as to exceed the step threshold and a step correction can
occur during and after the data transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
huff-n&rsquo;-puff filter is designed to correct the
apparent time offset in these cases. It depends on knowledge
of the propagation delay when no other traffic is present,
such as during other than work hours. The filter remembers
the minimum delay over the most recent interval measured
usually in hours. Under conditions of severe delay, the
filter corrects the apparent offset using the sign of the
offset and the difference between the apparent delay and
minimum delay. The name of the filter reflects the negative
(huff) and positive (puff) correction, which depends on the
sign of the offset. The filter is activated by the <b>tinker
huffpuff</b> command, as described in the Miscellaneous
Options page.</p>

<h2>LEAP SECOND PROCESSING
<a name="LEAP SECOND PROCESSING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As provided by
international agreement, an extra second is sometimes
inserted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) at the end of a
selected month, usually June or December. The National
Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides an
historic leapseconds file at <b>time.nist.gov</b> for
retrieval via FTP. When this file, usually called
<b>ntp-leapseconds.list</b>, is copied and installed in a
directory. The <b>leapfile</b> configuration command
specifies the path to this file. At startup, <b>ntpd</b>
reads it and initializes three leapsecond values: the NTP
seconds at the next leap event, the offset of UTC relative
to International Atomic Time (TAI) after the leap and the
NTP seconds when the leapseconds file expires and should be
retrieved again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a host does
not have the leapsecond values, they can be obtained over
the net using the Autokey security protocol. Ordinarily, the
leapseconds file is installed on the primary servers and the
values flow from them via secondary servers to the clients.
When multiple servers are involved, the values with the
latest expiration time are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the latest
leap is in the past, nothing further is done other than to
install the TAI offset. If the leap is in the future less
than 28 days, the leap warning bits are set. If in the
future less than 23 hours, the kernel is armed to insert one
second at the end of the current day. If the kernel is
enabled, the leap is done automatically at that time;
otherwise, the clock is effectively stopped for one second
at the leap. Additional details are in the The NTP Timescale
and Leap Seconds white paper</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If none of the
above provisions are available, dsependent servers and
clients tally the leap warning bits of surviving servers and
reference clocks. When a majority of the survivors show
warning, a leap is programmed at the end of the current
month. During the month and day of insertion, they operate
as above. In this way the leap is is propagated at all
dependent servers and clients.</p>

<h2>ADDITIONAL FEATURES
<a name="ADDITIONAL FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A new
experimental feature called interleaved modes can be used in
NTP symmetric or broadcast modes. It is designed to improve
accuracy by avoiding kernel latency and queueing delay, as
described on the NTP Interleaved Modes page. It is activated
by the <b>xleave</b> option with the <b>peer</b> or
<b>broadcast</b> configuration commands. The NTP protocol
automatically reconfigures in normal or interleaved mode as
required. Ordinary broadcast clients can use the same
servers as interleaved clients at the same time. Further
details are in the white paper NTP Interleaved On-Wire
Protocol and the briefing Interleaved Synchronization
Protocols for LANs and Space Data Links.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>ntpd</b>,
is configured with NetInfo support, it will attempt to read
its configuration from the NetInfo service if the default
<b>ntp.conf</b> file cannot be read and no file is specified
by the <b>-c</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contexts
where a host name is expected, a <b>-4</b> qualifier
preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4
namespace, while a <b>-6</b> qualifier forces DNS resolution
to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
internal <b>ntpd</b> variables can be displayed and
configuration options altered while the <b>ntpd</b> is
running using the <b>ntpq</b> and <b>ntpdc</b> utility
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>ntpd</b> starts it looks at the value of <b>umask</b>,
and if zero <b>ntpd</b> will set the <b>umask</b> to
<b>022</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless the
<b>-n</b>, <b>-d</b> or <b>-D</b> option is used,
<b>ntpd</b> changes the current working directory to the
root directory, so any options or commands specifying paths
need to use an absolute path or a path relative to the
root.</p>

<p>Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less than
the step threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and stepped
if above the threshold. This option sets the threshold to
600 s, which is well within the accuracy window to set the
clock manually. Note: Since the slew rate of typical Unix
kernels is limited to 0.5 ms/s, each second of adjustment
requires an amortization interval of 2000 s. Thus, an
adjustment as much as 600 s will take almost 14 days to
complete. This option can be used with the <b>-g</b> and
<b>-q</b> options. See the <b>tinker</b> command for other
options. Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled with
this option.</p></td></tr>

<h2>THE CONFIGURATION FILE
<a name="THE CONFIGURATION FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily,
<b>ntpd</b> reads the <b>ntp.conf</b> configuration file at
startup in order to determine the synchronization sources
and operating modes. It is also possible to specify a
working, although limited, configuration entirely on the
command line, obviating the need for a configuration file.
This may be particularly useful when the local host is to be
configured as a broadcast client, with servers determined by
listening to broadcasts at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually, the
configuration file is installed as<b>/etc/ntp.conf</b>, but
could be installed elsewhere (see the <b>-c</b>
<i>conffile</i> command line option). The file format is
similar to other Unix configuration files - comments begin
with a <b>#</b> character and extend to the end of the line;
blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configuration
commands consist of an initial command keyword followed by a
list of option keywords separated by whitespace. Commands
may not be continued over multiple lines. Options may be
host names, host addresses written in numeric, dotted-quad
form, integers, floating point numbers (when specifying
times in seconds) and text strings. Optional arguments are
delimited by <b>[ ]</b> in the options pages, while
alternatives are separated by <b>|</b>. The notation <b>[
