<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sane&minus;canon_pp
&minus; SANE backend for Canon CanoScan Parallel Port
flatbed scanners</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sane&minus;canon_pp</b> library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Canon flatbed scanners:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">CanoScan FB320P
<br>
CanoScan FB620P <br>
CanoScan FB330P <br>
CanoScan FB630P <br>
CanoScan N340P <br>
CanoScan N640P <br>
CanoScan N640P ex</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No USB scanners
are supported and there are no plans to support them in the
future. Other projects are working on support for USB
scanners. See the <b>PROJECTS</b> file for more detail. The
FB310P and FB610P are re-badged Avision scanners which use a
different command set, so are unlikely to be supported by
this backend in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT: this
is alpha code. While we have made every effort to make it as
reliable as possible, it will not always work as expected.
Feedback is still appreciated. Please send any bug reports
to the maintainers as listed on the web page (listed in
<b>SEE ALSO</b> below).</p>

<h2>DEVICE NAMES
<a name="DEVICE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
expects device names of the form presented by libieee1284.
These names are highly dependent on operating system and
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux 2.4
kernels this will be of the form <i>parport0</i> or older
(2.2 and before) kernels may produce names like <i>0x378</i>
(the base address of your port) or simply <i>0</i> depending
on your module configuration. Check the contents of
<i>/proc/parport</i> if it exists. If you don&rsquo;t want
to specify a default port (or don&rsquo;t know its name),
the backend should be able to detect which port your scanner
is on.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the <i>canon_pp.conf</i> file is a list of options for the
driver to use. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The supported
options are currently <b>ieee1284</b>, <b>calibrate</b>,
<b>init_mode</b>, and <b>force_nibble</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>ieee1284</b> <i>port-name</i> defines which port to use.
The format of port-name is OS dependent, based on the names
presented by libieee1284. Please only have one of these
lines, or all but one will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>calibrate</b> <i>cal-file [port-name]</i> defines which
calibration file to use on a per-port basis. If you only
have one parport, the port-name argument may be omitted
&minus; but be careful as this will cause problems on
multi-scanner systems. You may have as many of these lines
as you like, as long as each has a unique port name. The
tilde (&lsquo;~&rsquo;) character is acceptable and will be
expanded to the value of the HOME environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>init_mode</b> <i>&lt;AUTO|FB620P|FB630P&gt;
[portname]</i> defines which initialisation (wake-up) mode
to use on a per-port basis. If you only have one parport,
the portname argument may be omitted &minus; but be careful
as this may cause problems on multi-scanner systems. You may
have as many of these lines as you like, as long as each has
a unique port name. The valid initialisation modes are
FB620P (which strobes 10101010 and 01010101 on the data
pins), FB630P (which strobes 11001100 and 00110011 on the
data pins) and AUTO, which will try FB630P mode first then
FB620P mode second. The FB620P mode is also used by the
FB320P. The FB630P mode is used by the FB330P, N340P, and
N640P.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>force_nibble</b> forces the driver to use nibble mode
even if ECP mode is reported to work by libieee1284. This
works-around the rare issue of ECP mode being reported to
work by the library, then not working.</p>

<h2>TIPS
<a name="TIPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hit the
&quot;Calibrate&quot; button before scanning. It vastly
improves the quality of scans.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
automatic detection of your scanner, uncomment the
&quot;canon_pp&quot; line from
<i>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</i></p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/etc/sane.d/canon_pp.conf</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The backend configuration file
(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;canon_pp.a</i></p>

this backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;canon_pp.so</i></p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&lsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&lsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP=4</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Features
available in the Windows interface <br>
Brightness and Contrast</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These are not implemented, and
probably never will be. These appear to be implemented
entirely in software. Use GIMP or a similar program if you
need these features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Descreen Mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This appears on our first
analysis to be just oversampling with an anti-aliasing
filter. Again, it seems to be implemented entirely in
software, so GIMP is your best bet for now.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Gamma Tables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is under investigation,
but for now only a simple gamma profile (ie: the one
returned during calibration) will be loaded.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Communication
Problems</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ECP mode in
libieee1284 doesn&rsquo;t always work properly, even with
new hardware. We believe that this is a ppdev problem. If
you change the configuration file to include
<b>force_nibble</b> , the problem will go away, but you will
only be able to scan in nibble mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the
scanner can be left in a state where our code cannot revive
it. If the backend reports no scanner present, try
unplugging the power and plugging it back in. Also try
unplugging printers from the pass-through port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scanner
will not respond correctly to our commands when you first
plug in the power. You may find if you try a scan very soon
after plugging in the power that the backend will
incorrectly report that you have no scanner present. To
avoid this, give it about 10 seconds to reset itself before
attempting any scans.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Repeated
Lines</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes at
high resolutions (ie. 600dpi) you will notice lines which
appear twice. These lines correspond to points where the
scanner head has stopped during the scan (it stops every
time the internal 64kb buffer is full). Basically it&rsquo;s
a mechanical problem inside the scanner, that the tolerance
of movement for a start/stop event is greater than 1/600
inches. I&rsquo;ve never tried the windows driver so
I&rsquo;m not sure how (or if) it works around this problem,
but as we don&rsquo;t know how to rewind the scanner head to
do these bits again, there&rsquo;s currently no nice way to
deal with the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Grey-scale
Scans</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
the scanner uses the green LEDs to read grey-scale scans,
meaning green coloured things will appear lighter than
normal, and red and blue coloured items will appear darker
than normal. For high-accuracy grey-scale scans of colour
items, it&rsquo;s best just to scan in colour and convert to
grey-scale in graphics software such as the GIMP.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>FB620P/FB320P
Caveats</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These models
can not be reset in the same way as the others. The windows
driver doesn&rsquo;t know how to reset them either &minus;
when left with an inconsistent scanner, it will start
scanning half way down the page!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aborting is
known to work correctly on the FB*30P models, and is known
to be broken on the FB*20P models. The FB620P which I tested
on simply returns garbage after a scan has been aborted
using the method we know. Aborting is able to leave the
scanner in a state where it can be shut down, but not where
another scan can be made.</p>
