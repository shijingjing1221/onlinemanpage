<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">curl_easy_getinfo
- extract information from a curl handle</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CURLcode
curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Request
internal information from the curl session with this
function. The third argument <b>MUST</b> be a pointer to a
long, a pointer to a char *, a pointer to a struct
curl_slist * or a pointer to a double (as this documentation
describes further down). The data pointed-to will be filled
in accordingly and can be relied upon only if the function
returns CURLE_OK. Use this function AFTER a performed
transfer if you want to get transfer- oriented data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should not
free the memory returned by this function unless it is
explicitly mentioned below.</p>

<h2>AVAILABLE INFORMATION
<a name="AVAILABLE INFORMATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
information can be extracted: <br>
CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the last used effective URL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the last received HTTP, FTP or SMTP response code.
This option was previously known as CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE in
libcurl 7.10.7 and earlier. The value will be zero if no
server response code has been received. Note that a
proxy&rsquo;s CONNECT response should be read with
<i>CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE</i> and not this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
SMTP responses added in 7.25.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the last received proxy response code to a CONNECT
request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_FILETIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the remote time of the retrieved document (in number
of seconds since 1 jan 1970 in the GMT/UTC time zone). If
you get -1, it can be because of many reasons (unknown, the
server hides it or the server doesn&rsquo;t support the
command that tells document time etc) and the time of the
document is unknown. Note that you must tell the server to
collect this information before the transfer is made, by
using the CURLOPT_FILETIME option to
<i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> or you will unconditionally get a
-1 back. (Added in 7.5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total time in seconds for the previous transfer,
including name resolving, TCP connect etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the name resolving was completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the SSL/SSH connect/handshake to the remote host was
completed. This time is most often very near to the
PRETRANSFER time, except for cases such as HTTP pippelining
where the pretransfer time can be delayed due to waits in
line for the pipeline and more. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all
pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to
the particular protocol(s) involved. It does <i>not</i>
involve the sending of the protocol- specific request that
triggers a transfer.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the first byte is received by libcurl. This includes
CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME and also the time the server needs
to calculate the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total time, in seconds, it took for all
redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer
and transfer before final transaction was started.
CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME contains the complete execution time
for multiple redirections. (Added in 7.9.7)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the total number of redirections that were actually
followed. (Added in 7.9.7)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the URL a redirect <i>would</i> take you
to if you would enable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION. This can come
very handy if you think using the built-in libcurl redirect
logic isn&rsquo;t good enough for you but you would still
prefer to avoid implementing all the magic of figuring out
the new URL. (Added in 7.18.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total amount of bytes that were uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total amount of bytes that were downloaded. The
amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset
again for each new transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the average download speed that curl measured for
the complete download. Measured in bytes/second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the average upload speed that curl measured for the
complete upload. Measured in bytes/second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the total size of all the headers received. Measured
in number of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the total size of the issued requests. This is so
far only for HTTP requests. Note that this may be more than
one request if FOLLOWLOCATION is true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the result of the certification verification that
was requested (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to
<i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass the address of a
&rsquo;struct curl_slist *&rsquo; to receive a linked-list
of OpenSSL crypto-engines supported. Note that engines are
normally implemented in separate dynamic libraries. Hence
not all the returned engines may be available at run-time.
<b>NOTE:</b> you must call <i>curl_slist_free_all(3)</i> on
the list pointer once you&rsquo;re done with it, as libcurl
will not free the data for you. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the content-length of the download. This is the
value read from the Content-Length: field. Since 7.19.4,
this returns -1 if the size isn&rsquo;t known.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the specified size of the upload. Since 7.19.4, this
returns -1 if the size isn&rsquo;t known.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the content-type of the downloaded
object. This is the value read from the Content-Type: field.
If you get NULL, it means that the server didn&rsquo;t send
a valid Content-Type header or that the protocol used
doesn&rsquo;t support this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_PRIVATE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the pointer to the private data
associated with the curl handle (set with the
CURLOPT_PRIVATE option to <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>).
Please note that for internal reasons, the value is returned
as a char pointer, although effectively being a &rsquo;void
*&rsquo;. (Added in 7.10.3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive a bitmask indicating the authentication method(s)
available. The meaning of the bits is explained in the
CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH option for <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>.
(Added in 7.10.8)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive a bitmask indicating the authentication method(s)
available for your proxy authentication. (Added in
7.10.8)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the errno variable from a connect failure. Note that
the value is only set on failure, it is not reset upon a
successful operation. (Added in 7.12.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive how many new connections libcurl had to create to
achieve the previous transfer (only the successful connects
are counted). Combined with <i>CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT</i>
you are able to know how many times libcurl successfully
reused existing connection(s) or not. See the Connection
Options of <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> to see how libcurl
tries to make persistent connections to save time. (Added in
7.12.3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the pointer to a zero-terminated string
holding the IP address of the most recent connection done
with this <b>curl</b> handle. This string may be IPv6 if
that&rsquo;s enabled. Note that you get a pointer to a
memory area that will be re-used at next request so you need
to copy the string if you want to keep the information.
(Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_PRIMARY_PORT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the destination port of the most recent connection
done with this <b>curl</b> handle. (Added in 7.21.0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive the pointer to a zero-terminated string
holding the local (source) IP address of the most recent
connection done with this <b>curl</b> handle. This string
may be IPv6 if that&rsquo;s enabled. The same restrictions
apply as to <i>CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP</i>. (Added in
7.21.0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_LOCAL_PORT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the local (source) port of the most recent
connection done with this <b>curl</b> handle. (Added in
7.21.0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_COOKIELIST</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a
&rsquo;struct curl_slist *&rsquo; to receive a linked-list
of all cookies cURL knows (expired ones, too). Don&rsquo;t
forget to <i>curl_slist_free_all(3)</i> the list after it
has been used. If there are no cookies (cookies for the
handle have not been enabled or simply none have been
received) &rsquo;struct curl_slist *&rsquo; will be set to
point to NULL. (Added in 7.14.1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the last socket used by this curl session. If the
socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish
working with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup()
as usual and let libcurl close the socket and cleanup other
resources associated with the handle. This is typically used
in combination with <i>CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY</i>. (Added in
7.15.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this API
is not really working on win64, since the SOCKET type on
win64 is 64 bit large while its &rsquo;long&rsquo; is only
32 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive a pointer to a string holding the path of
the entry path. That is the initial path libcurl ended up in
when logging on to the remote FTP server. This stores a NULL
as pointer if something is wrong. (Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Also works for
SFTP since 7.21.4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CERTINFO</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a
&rsquo;struct curl_certinfo *&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll get it
set to point to struct that holds a number of linked lists
with info about the certificate chain, assuming you had
CURLOPT_CERTINFO enabled when the previous request was done.
The struct reports how many certs it found and then you can
extract info for each of those certs by following the linked
lists. The info chain is provided in a series of data in the
format &quot;name:content&quot; where the content is for the
specific named data. See also the certinfo.c example. NOTE:
this option is only available in libcurl built with OpenSSL
support. (Added in 7.19.1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the number 1 if the condition provided in the
previous request didn&rsquo;t match (see
<i>CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION</i>). Alas, if this returns a 1 you
know that the reason you didn&rsquo;t get data in return is
because it didn&rsquo;t fulfill the condition. The long ths
argument points to will get a zero stored if the condition
instead was met. (Added in 7.19.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_RTSP_SESSION_ID</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a char
pointer to receive a pointer to a string holding the most
recent RTSP Session ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
wishing to resume an RTSP session on another connection
should retreive this info before closing the active
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_RTSP_CLIENT_CSEQ</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the next CSeq that will be used by the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_RTSP_SERVER_CSEQ</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the next server CSeq that will be expected by the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>(NOTE:
listening for server initiated requests is currently
unimplemented).</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
wishing to resume an RTSP session on another connection
should retreive this info before closing the active
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLINFO_RTSP_CSEQ_RECV</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the most recently received CSeq from the server. If
your application encounters a <i>CURLE_RTSP_CSEQ_ERROR</i>
then you may wish to troubleshoot and/or fix the CSeq
mismatch by peeking at this value.</p>
