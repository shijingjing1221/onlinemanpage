<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">lvm.conf
&mdash; Configuration file for LVM2</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>lvm.conf</b>
is loaded during the initialisation phase of <b>lvm</b>(8).
This file can in turn lead to other files being loaded -
settings read in later override earlier settings. File
timestamps are checked between commands and if any have
changed, all the files are reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The settings
defined in lvm.conf can be overridden by any of these
extended configuration methods: <b><br>
direct config override on command line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>&minus;&minus;config
ConfigurationString</b> command line option takes the
ConfigurationString as direct string representation of the
configuration to override the existing configuration. The
ConfigurationString is of exactly the same format as used in
any LVM configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>profile config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A profile is a set of selected
customizable configuration settings that are aimed to
achieve a certain characteristics in various environments or
uses. It&rsquo;s used to override existing configuration.
Normally, the name of the profile should reflect that
environment or use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
groups of profiles recognised: <b>command profiles</b> and
<b>metadata profiles</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>command
profile</b> is used to override selected configuration
settings at global LVM command level - it is applied at the
very beginning of LVM command execution and it is used
throughout the whole time of LVM command execution. The
command profile is applied by using the
<b>&minus;&minus;commandprofile ProfileName</b> command line
option that is recognised by all LVM2 commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>metadata
profile</b> is used to override selected configuration
settings at Volume Group/Logical Volume level - it is
applied independently for each Volume Group/Logical Volume
that is being processed. As such, each Volume Group/Logical
Volume can store the profile name used in its metadata so
next time the Volume Group/Logical Volume is processed, the
profile is applied automatically. If Volume Group and any of
its Logical Volumes have different profiles defined, the
profile defined for the Logical Volume is preferred. The
metadata profile can be attached/detached by using the
<b>lvchange</b> and <b>vgchange</b> commands and their
<b>&minus;&minus;metadataprofile ProfileName</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;detachprofile</b> options or the
<b>&minus;&minus;metadataprofile</b> option during creation
when using <b>vgcreate</b> or <b>lvcreate</b> command. The
<b>vgs</b> and <b>lvs</b> reporting commands provide <b>-o
vg_profile</b> and <b>-o lv_profile</b> output options to
show the metadata profile currently attached to a Volume
Group or a Logical Volume.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
options allowed for command profiles is mutually exclusive
when compared to the set of options allowed for metadata
profiles. The settings that belong to either of these two
sets can&rsquo;t be mixed together and LVM tools will reject
such profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">LVM itself
provides a few predefined configuration profiles. Users are
allowed to add more profiles with different values if
needed. For this purpose, there&rsquo;s the
<b>command_profile_template.profile</b> (for command
profiles) and <b>metadata_profile_template.profile</b> (for
metadata profiles) which contain all settings that are
customizable by profiles of certain type. Users are
encouraged to copy these template profiles and edit them as
needed. Alternatively, the <b>lvm dumpconfig
&minus;&minus;file &lt;ProfileName.profile&gt;
&minus;&minus;type profilable-command &lt;section&gt;</b> or
<b>lvm dumpconfig &minus;&minus;file
&lt;ProfileName.profile&gt; &minus;&minus;type
profilable-metadata &lt;section&gt;</b> can be used to
generate a configuration with profilable settings in either
of the type for given section and save it to new
ProfileName.profile (if the section is not specified, all
profilable settings are reported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The profiles
are stored in /etc/lvm/profile directory by default. This
location can be changed by using the
<b>config/profile_dir</b> setting. Each profile
configuration is stored in <b>ProfileName.profile</b> file
in the profile directory. When referencing the profile, the
<b>.profile</b> suffix is left out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tag config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">See <b>tags</b> configuration
setting description below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When several
configuration methods are used at the same time and when LVM
looks for the value of a particular setting, it traverses
this <b>config cascade</b> from left to right:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>direct
config override on command line</b> -&gt; <b>command profile
config</b> -&gt; <b>metadata profile config</b> -&gt; <b>tag
config</b> -&gt; <b>lvm.conf</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No part of this
cascade is compulsory. If there&rsquo;s no setting value
found at the end of the cascade, a default value is used for
that setting. Use <b>lvm dumpconfig</b> to check what
settings are in use and what the default values are.</p>

<h2>SYNTAX
<a name="SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
describes the configuration file syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whitespace is
not significant unless it is within quotes. This provides a
wide choice of acceptable indentation styles. Comments begin
with # and continue to the end of the line. They are treated
as whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
informal grammar: <b><br>
file</b> = <b>value</b>*</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A configuration file consists
of a set of values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>value</b> = <b>section</b> |
<b>assignment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A value can either be a new
section, or an assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>section</b> =
<b>identifier</b> &rsquo;<b>{</b>&rsquo; <b>value</b>*
&rsquo;<b>}</b>&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A section groups associated
values together. If the same section is encountered multiple
times, the contents of all instances are concatenated
together in the order of appearance. <br>
It is denoted by a name and delimited by curly brackets.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>assignment</b> =
<b>identifier</b> &rsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; ( <b>array</b> |
<b>type</b> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An assignment associates a type
with an identifier. If the identifier contains forward
slashes, those are interpreted as path delimiters. The
statement <b>section/key = value</b> is equivalent to
<b>section { key = value }</b>. If multiple instances of the
same key are encountered, only the last value is used (and a
warning is issued).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Inhomogeneous arrays are

An empty array is acceptable.</p>

<h2>SECTIONS
<a name="SECTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sections
that may be present in the file are: <b><br>
devices</b> &mdash; Device settings</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dir</b>
&mdash; Directory in which to create volume group device
nodes. Defaults to &quot;/dev&quot;. Commands also accept
this as a prefix on volume group names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>scan</b>
&mdash; List of directories to scan recursively for LVM
physical volumes. Devices in directories outside this
hierarchy will be ignored. Defaults to &quot;/dev&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>preferred_names</b>
&mdash; List of patterns compared in turn against all the
pathnames referencing the same device in in the scanned
directories. The pathname that matches the earliest pattern
in the list is the one used in any output. As an example, if
device-mapper multipathing is used, the following will
select multipath device names: <b><br>
devices { preferred_names = [ &quot;^/dev/mapper/mpath&quot;
] }</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>filter</b>
&mdash; List of patterns to apply to devices found by a
scan. Patterns are regular expressions delimited by any
character and preceded by <b>a</b> (for accept) or <b>r</b>
(for reject). The list is traversed in order, and the first
regex that matches determines if the device will be accepted
or rejected (ignored). Devices that don&rsquo;t match any
patterns are accepted. If you want to reject patterns that
don&rsquo;t match, end the list with &quot;r/.*/&quot;. If
there are several names for the same device (e.g. symbolic
links in /dev), if the first matching pattern in the list
for any of the names is an <b>a</b> pattern, the device is
accepted; otherwise if the first matching pattern in the
list for any of the names is an <b>r</b> pattern it is
rejected; otherwise it is accepted. As an example, to ignore
/dev/cdrom you could use: <b><br>
devices { filter=[&quot;r|cdrom|&quot;] }</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>global_filter</b>
&mdash; Since &quot;filter&quot; might get overridden from
the command line, it is not suitable for system-wide device
filtering (udev rules, lvmetad). To hide devices from
LVM-specific udev processing and/or from lvmetad, you need
to set global_filter. The syntax is the same as for normal
&quot;filter&quot; above. Devices that fail the
global_filter are not even opened by LVM.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cache_dir</b>
&mdash; Persistent filter cache file directory. Defaults to
&quot;/etc/lvm/cache&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>write_cache_state</b>
&mdash; Set to 0 to disable the writing out of the
persistent filter cache file when <b>lvm</b> exits. Defaults
to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>types</b>
&mdash; List of pairs of additional acceptable block device
types found in /proc/devices together with maximum
(non-zero) number of partitions (normally 16). By default,
LVM2 supports ide, sd, md, loop, dasd, dac960, nbd, ida,
cciss, ubd, ataraid, drbd, power2, i2o_block and iseries/vd.
Block devices with major numbers of different types are
ignored by LVM2. Example: <b>types = [&quot;fd&quot;,
16]</b>. To create physical volumes on device-mapper volumes
created outside LVM2, perhaps encrypted ones from
<b>cryptsetup</b>, you&rsquo;ll need <b>types =
[&quot;device-mapper&quot;, 16]</b>. But if you do this, be
careful to avoid recursion within LVM2. The figure for
number of partitions is not currently used in LVM2 - and
might never be.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sysfs_scan</b>
&mdash; If set to 1 and your kernel supports sysfs and it is
mounted, sysfs will be used as a quick way of filtering out
block devices that are not present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>md_component_detection</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, LVM2 will ignore devices used as
components of software RAID (md) devices by looking for md
superblocks. This doesn&rsquo;t always work satisfactorily
e.g. if a device has been reused without wiping the md
superblocks first.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>md_chunk_alignment</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, and a Physical Volume is placed
directly upon an md device, LVM2 will align its data blocks
with the md device&rsquo;s stripe-width.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>data_alignment_detection</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, and your kernel provides topology
information in sysfs for the Physical Volume, the start of
data area will be aligned on a multiple of the
&rsquo;minimum_io_size&rsquo; or
&rsquo;optimal_io_size&rsquo; exposed in sysfs.
minimum_io_size is the smallest request the device can
perform without incurring a read-modify-write penalty (e.g.
MD&rsquo;s chunk size). optimal_io_size is the
device&rsquo;s preferred unit of receiving I/O (e.g.
MD&rsquo;s stripe width). minimum_io_size is used if
optimal_io_size is undefined (0). If both
<b>md_chunk_alignment</b> and
<b>data_alignment_detection</b> are enabled the result of
<b>data_alignment_detection</b> is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>data_alignment</b>
&mdash; Default alignment (in KB) of start of data area when
creating a new Physical Volume using the <b>lvm2</b> format.
If a Physical Volume is placed directly upon an md device
and <b>md_chunk_alignment</b> or
<b>data_alignment_detection</b> is enabled this parameter is
ignored. Set to 0 to use the default alignment of 64KB or
the page size, if larger.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>data_alignment_offset_detection</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, and your kernel provides topology
information in sysfs for the Physical Volume, the start of
the aligned data area of the Physical Volume will be shifted
by the alignment_offset exposed in sysfs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To see the
location of the first Physical Extent of an existing
Physical Volume use <b>pvs &minus;o +pe_start</b> . It will
be a multiple of the requested <b>data_alignment</b> plus
the alignment_offset from
<b>data_alignment_offset_detection</b> (if enabled) or the
pvcreate commandline.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>disable_after_error_count</b>
&mdash; During each LVM operation errors received from each
device are counted. If the counter of a particular device
exceeds the limit set here, no further I/O is sent to that
device for the remainder of the respective operation.
Setting the parameter to 0 disables the counters
altogether.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pv_min_size</b>
&mdash; Minimal size (in KB) of the block device which can
be used as a PV. In clustered environment all nodes have to
use the same value. Any value smaller than 512KB is ignored.
Up to and include version 2.02.84 the default was 512KB.
From 2.02.85 onwards it was changed to 2MB to avoid floppy
drives by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>issue_discards</b>
&mdash; Issue discards to a logical volumes&rsquo;s
underlying physical volume(s) when the logical volume is no
longer using the physical volumes&rsquo; space (e.g.
lvremove, lvreduce, etc). Discards inform the storage that a
region is no longer in use. Storage that supports discards
advertise the protocol specific way discards should be
issued by the kernel (TRIM, UNMAP, or WRITE SAME with UNMAP
bit set). Not all storage will support or benefit from
discards but SSDs and thinly provisioned LUNs generally do.
If set to 1, discards will only be issued if both the
storage and kernel provide support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allocation</b> &mdash; Space
allocation policies</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cling_tag_list</b>
&mdash; List of PV tags matched by the <b>cling</b>
allocation policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When searching
for free space to extend an LV, the <b>cling</b> allocation
policy will choose space on the same PVs as the last segment
of the existing LV. If there is insufficient space and a
list of tags is defined here, it will check whether any of
them are attached to the PVs concerned and then seek to
match those PV tags between existing extents and new
extents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The @ prefix
for tags is required. Use the special tag &quot;@*&quot; as
a wildcard to match any PV tag and so use all PV tags for
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
LVs are mirrored between two sites within a single VG. PVs
are tagged with either @site1 or @site2 to indicate where
they are situated and these two PV tags are selected for use
with this allocation policy:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">cling_tag_list
= [ &quot;@site1&quot;, &quot;@site2&quot; ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cache_pool_cachemode</b>
&mdash; Cache mode for new cache pools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
default cache mode a new cache pool will be given. Valid
cache modes are: <b>writethrough</b> - Data blocks are
immediately written from the cache to disk. <b>writeback</b>
- Data blocks are written from the cache back to disk after
some delay to improve performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>log</b> &mdash; Default log
settings</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>file</b>
&mdash; Location of log file. If this entry is not present,
no log file is written.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>overwrite</b>
&mdash; Set to 1 to overwrite the log file each time a tool
is invoked. By default tools append messages to the log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>level</b>
&mdash; Log level (0-9) of messages to write to the file. 9
is the most verbose; 0 should produce no output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>verbose</b>
&mdash; Default level (0-3) of messages sent to stdout or
stderr. 3 is the most verbose; 0 should produce the least
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>silent</b>
&mdash; Set to 1 to suppress all non-essential tool output.
When set, display and reporting tools will still write the
requested device properties to standard output, but messages
confirming that something was or wasn&rsquo;t changed will
be reduced to the &rsquo;verbose&rsquo; level and not appear
unless &minus;v is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>syslog</b>
&mdash; Set to 1 (the default) to send log messages through
syslog. Turn off by setting to 0. If you set to an integer
greater than one, this is used - unvalidated - as the
facility. The default is LOG_USER. See
/usr/include/sys/syslog.h for safe facility values to use.
For example, LOG_LOCAL0 might be 128.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>indent</b>
&mdash; When set to 1 (the default) messages are indented
according to their severity, two spaces per level. Set to 0
to turn off indentation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>command_names</b>
&mdash; When set to 1, the command name is used as a prefix
for each message. Default is 0 (off).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>prefix</b>
&mdash; Prefix used for all messages (after the command
name). Default is two spaces.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>activation</b>
&mdash; Set to 1 to log messages while devices are suspended
during activation. Only set this temporarily while debugging
a problem because in low memory situations this setting can
cause your machine to lock up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>backup</b> &mdash;
Configuration for metadata backups.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>archive_dir</b>
&mdash; Directory used for automatic metadata archives.
Backup copies of former metadata for each volume group are
archived here. Defaults to &quot;/etc/lvm/archive&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>backup_dir</b>
&mdash; Directory used for automatic metadata backups. A
single backup copy of the current metadata for each volume
group is stored here. Defaults to
&quot;/etc/lvm/backup&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>archive</b>
&mdash; Whether or not tools automatically archive existing
metadata into <b>archive_dir</b> before making changes to
it. Default is 1 (automatic archives enabled). Set to 0 to
disable. Disabling this might make metadata recovery
difficult or impossible if something goes wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>backup</b>
&mdash; Whether or not tools make an automatic backup into
<b>backup_dir</b> after changing metadata. Default is 1
(automatic backups enabled). Set to 0 to disable. Disabling
this might make metadata recovery difficult or impossible if
something goes wrong.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>retain_min</b>
&mdash; Minimum number of archives to keep. Defaults to
10.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>retain_days</b>
&mdash; Minimum number of days to keep archive files.
Defaults to 30.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>shell</b> &mdash; LVM2
built-in readline shell settings</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>history_size</b>
&mdash; Maximum number of lines of shell history to retain
(default 100) in $HOME/.lvm_history</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>global</b> &mdash; Global
settings</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>test</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, run tools in test mode i.e. no changes
to the on-disk metadata will get made. It&rsquo;s equivalent
to having the -t option on every command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>activation</b>
&mdash; Set to 0 to turn off all communication with the
device-mapper driver. Useful if you want to manipulate
logical volumes while device-mapper is not present in your
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>proc</b>
&mdash; Mount point of proc filesystem. Defaults to
/proc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>umask</b>
&mdash; File creation mask for any files and directories
created. Interpreted as octal if the first digit is zero.
Defaults to 077. Use 022 to allow other users to read the
files by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>format</b>
&mdash; The default value of
<b>&minus;&minus;metadatatype</b> used to determine which
format of metadata to use when creating new physical volumes
and volume groups. <b>lvm1</b> or <b>lvm2</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fallback_to_lvm1</b>
&mdash; Set this to 1 if you need to be able to switch
between 2.4 kernels using LVM1 and kernels including
device-mapper. The LVM2 tools should be installed as normal
and the LVM1 tools should be installed with a .lvm1 suffix
e.g. vgscan.lvm1. If an LVM2 tool is then run but unable to
communicate with device-mapper, it will automatically invoke
the equivalent LVM1 version of the tool. Note that for LVM1
tools to manipulate physical volumes and volume groups
created by LVM2 you must use <b>&minus;&minus;metadataformat
lvm1</b> when creating them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>library_dir</b>
&mdash; A directory searched for LVM2&rsquo;s shared
libraries ahead of the places <b>dlopen</b> (3)
searches.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>format_libraries</b>
&mdash; A list of shared libraries to load that contain code
to process different formats of metadata. For example,
liblvm2formatpool.so is needed to read GFS pool metadata if
LVM2 was configured
<b>&minus;&minus;with-pool=shared</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>locking_type</b>
&mdash; What type of locking to use. 1 is the default, which
use flocks on files in <b>locking_dir</b> (see below) to
avoid conflicting LVM2 commands running concurrently on a
single machine. 0 disables locking and risks corrupting your
metadata. If set to 2, the tools will load the external
<b>locking_library</b> (see below). If the tools were
configured <b>&minus;&minus;with-cluster=internal</b> (the
default) then 3 means to use built-in cluster-wide locking.
Type 4 enforces read-only metadata and forbids any
operations that might want to modify Volume Group metadata.
All changes to logical volumes and their states are
communicated using locks.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wait_for_locks</b>
&mdash; When set to 1, the default, the tools wait if a lock
request cannot be satisfied immediately. When set to 0, the
operation is aborted instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>locking_dir</b>
&mdash; The directory LVM2 places its file locks if
<b>locking_type</b> is set to 1. The default is
<b>/var/lock/lvm</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>locking_library</b>
&mdash; The name of the external locking library to load if
<b>locking_type</b> is set to 2. The default is
<b>liblvm2clusterlock.so</b>. If you need to write such a
library, look at the lib/locking source code directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>use_lvmetad</b>
&mdash; Whether to use (trust) a running instance of
lvmetad. If this is set to 0, all commands fall back to the
usual scanning mechanisms. When set to 1 <b>and</b> when
lvmetad is running (it is not auto-started), the volume
group metadata and PV state flags are obtained from the
lvmetad instance and no scanning is done by the individual
commands. In a setup with lvmetad, lvmetad udev rules
<b>must</b> be set up for LVM to work correctly. Without
proper udev rules, all changes in block device configuration
will be <b>ignored</b> until a manual &rsquo;pvscan
&minus;&minus;cache&rsquo; is performed. <br>
If lvmetad has been running while use_lvmetad was 0, it
<b>MUST</b> be stopped before changing use_lvmetad to 1 and
started again afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tags</b> &mdash; Host tag
settings</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hosttags</b>
&mdash; If set to 1, create a host tag with the machine
name. Setting this to 0 does nothing, neither creating nor
destroying any tag. The machine name used is the nodename as
returned by <b>uname</b> (2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Additional host
tags to be set can be listed here as subsections. The @
prefix for tags is optional. Each of these host tag
subsections can contain a <b>host_list</b> array of host
names. If any one of these entries matches the machine name
exactly then the host tag gets defined on this particular
host, otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">After lvm.conf
has been processed, LVM2 works through each host tag that
has been defined in turn, and if there is a configuration
file called lvm_<b>&lt;host_tag&gt;</b>.conf it attempts to
load it. The activation/volume_list, devices/filter and
devices/types settings are merged (these all are lists),
otherwise any settings read in override settings found in
earlier files. Any additional host tags defined get appended
to the search list, so in turn they can lead to further
configuration files being processed. Use <b>lvm
dumpconfig</b> to check the result of config file
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example always sets host tags <b>tag1</b> and sets
<b>tag2</b> on machines fs1 and fs2:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">tags { tag1 { }
tag2 { host_list = [ &quot;fs1&quot;, &quot;fs2&quot; ] }
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">These options
are useful if you are replicating configuration files around
a cluster. Use of <b>hosttags = 1</b> means every machine
can have static and identical local configuration files yet
use different settings and activate different logical
volumes by default. See also <b>volume_list</b> below and
<b>&minus;&minus;addtag</b> in <b>lvm</b> (8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>activation</b> &mdash;
Settings affecting device-mapper activation</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>missing_stripe_filler</b>
&mdash; When activating an incomplete logical volume in
partial mode, this option dictates how the missing data is
replaced. A value of &quot;error&quot; will cause activation
to create error mappings for the missing data, meaning that
read access to missing portions of the volume will result in
I/O errors. You can instead also use a device path, and in
that case this device will be used in place of missing
stripes. However, note that using anything other than
&quot;error&quot; with mirrored or snapshotted volumes is
likely to result in data corruption. For instructions on how
to create a device that always returns zeros, see
<b>lvcreate</b> (8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mirror_region_size</b>
&mdash; Unit size in KB for copy operations when
mirroring.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readahead</b>
&mdash; Used when there is no readahead value stored in the
volume group metadata. Set to <b>none</b> to disable
readahead in these circumstances or <b>auto</b> to use the
default value chosen by the kernel.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reserved_memory</b>,
<b>reserved_stack</b> &mdash; How many KB to reserve for
LVM2 to use while logical volumes are suspended. If
insufficient memory is reserved before suspension, there is
a risk of machine deadlock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>process_priority</b>
&mdash; The nice value to use while devices are suspended.
This is set to a high priority so that logical volumes are
suspended (with I/O generated by other processes to those
logical volumes getting queued) for the shortest possible
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>volume_list</b>
&mdash; This acts as a filter through which all requests to
activate a logical volume on this machine are passed. A
logical volume is only activated if it matches an item in
the list. Tags must be preceded by @ and are checked against
all tags defined in the logical volume and volume group
metadata for a match. @* is short-hand to check every tag
set on the host machine (see <b>tags</b> above). Logical
volume and volume groups can also be included in the list by
name e.g. vg00, vg00/lvol1. If this setting is not present
but at least one host tag is defined then a default
single-entry list containing @* is assumed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>auto_activation_volume_list</b>
&mdash; This acts as a filter through which all requests to
autoactivate a logical volume on this machine are passed. A
logical volume is autoactivated if it matches an item in the
list. Volumes must also pass the <b>volume_list</b> filter,
if present. Tags must be preceded by @ and are checked
against all tags defined in the logical volume and volume
group metadata for a match. @* is short-hand to check every
tag set on the host machine (see <b>tags</b> above). Logical
volume and volume groups can also be included in the list by
name e.g. vg00, vg00/lvol1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>read_only_volume_list</b>
&mdash; This acts as a filter through which all requests to
activate a logical volume on this machine are passed. A
logical volume is activated in read-only mode (instead of
read-write) if it matches an item in the list. Volumes must
first pass the <b>volume_list</b> filter, if present. Tags
must be preceded by @ and are checked against all tags
defined in the logical volume and volume group metadata for
a match. @* is short-hand to check every tag set on the host
machine (see <b>tags</b> above). Logical volume and volume
groups can also be included in the list by name e.g. vg00,
vg00/lvol1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>metadata</b> &mdash;
Advanced metadata settings</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pvmetadatacopies</b>
&mdash; When creating a physical volume using the LVM2
metadata format, this is the default number of copies of
metadata to store on each physical volume. Currently it can
be set to 0, 1 or 2. The default is 1. If set to 2, one copy
is placed at the beginning of the disk and the other is
placed at the end. It can be overridden on the command line
with <b>&minus;&minus;pvmetadatacopies</b> (see
<b>pvcreate</b>). If creating a volume group with just one
physical volume, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have 2 copies. If
creating a large volume group with many physical volumes,
you may decide that 3 copies of the metadata is sufficient,
i.e. setting it to 1 on three of the physical volumes, and 0
on the rest. Every volume group must contain at least one
physical volume with at least 1 copy of the metadata (unless
using the text files described below). The disadvantage of
having lots of copies is that every time the tools access
the volume group, every copy of the metadata has to be
accessed, and this slows down the tools.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pvmetadatasize</b>
&mdash; Approximate number of sectors to set aside for each
copy of the metadata. Volume groups with large numbers of
physical or logical volumes, or volumes groups containing
complex logical volume structures will need additional space
for their metadata. The metadata areas are treated as
circular buffers, so unused space becomes filled with an
archive of the most recent previous versions of the
metadata.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pvmetadataignore</b>
When creating a physical volume using the LVM2 metadata
format, this states whether metadata areas should be
ignored. The default is &quot;n&quot;. If metadata areas on
a physical volume are ignored, LVM will not not store
metadata in the metadata areas present on newly created
Physical Volumes. The option can be overridden on the
command line with <b>&minus;&minus;metadataignore</b> (See
<b>pvcreate</b> and <b>pvchange</b>). Metadata areas cannot
be created or extended after Logical Volumes have been
allocated on the device. If you do not want to store
metadata on this device, it is still wise always to allocate
a metadata area (use a non-zero value for
<b>&minus;&minus;pvmetadatacopies</b>) in case you need it
in the future and to use this option to instruct LVM2 to
ignore it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgmetadatacopies</b>
&mdash; When creating a volume group using the LVM2 metadata
format, this is the default number of copies of metadata
desired across all the physical volumes in the volume group.
If set to a non-zero value, LVM will automatically set or
clear the metadataignore flag on the physical volumes (see
<b>pvcreate</b> and <b>pvchange
&minus;&minus;metadataignore</b>) in order to achieve the
desired number of metadata copies. An LVM command that adds
or removes physical volumes (for example, <b>vgextend</b>,
<b>vgreduce</b>, <b>vgsplit</b>, or <b>vgmerge</b>), may
cause LVM to automatically set or clear the metadataignore
flags. Also, if physical volumes go missing or reappear, or
a new number of copies is explicitly set (see <b>vgchange
&minus;&minus;vgmetadatacopies</b>), LVM may adjust the
metadataignore flags. Set <b>vgmetadatacopies</b> to 0
instructs LVM not to set or clear the metadataignore flags
automatically. You may set a value larger than the sum of
all metadata areas on all physical volumes. The value can be
overridden on the command line with
<b>&minus;&minus;vgmetadatacopies</b> for various commands
(for example, <b>vgcreate</b> and <b>vgchange</b>), and can
be queryied with the <b>vg_mda_copies</b> field of
<b>vgs</b>. This option is useful for volume groups
containing large numbers of physical volumes with metadata
as it may be used to minimize metadata read and write
overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dirs</b>
&mdash; List of directories holding live copies of LVM2
metadata as text files. These directories must not be on
logical volumes. It is possible to use LVM2 with a couple of
directories here, preferably on different
(non-logical-volume) filesystems and with no other on-disk
metadata, <b>pvmetadatacopies = 0</b>. Alternatively these
directories can be in addition to the on-disk metadata
areas. This feature was created during the development of
the LVM2 metadata before the new on-disk metadata areas were
designed and no longer gets tested. It is not supported
under low-memory conditions, and it is important never to
edit these metadata files unless you fully understand how
things work: to make changes you should always use the tools
as normal, or else vgcfgbackup, edit backup,
vgcfgrestore.</p>
