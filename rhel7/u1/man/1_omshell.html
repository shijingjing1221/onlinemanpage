<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">omshell - OMAPI
Command Shell</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>omshell</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The OMAPI
Command Shell, omshell, provides an interactive way to
connect to, query, and possibly change, the ISC DHCP
Server&rsquo;s state via OMAPI, the Object Management API.
By using OMAPI and omshell, you do not have to stop, make
changes, and then restart the DHCP server, but can make the
changes while the server is running. Omshell provides a way
of accessing OMAPI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OMAPI is simply
a communications mechanism that allows you to manipulate
objects. In order to actually <i>use</i> omshell, you
<i>must</i> understand what objects are available and how to
use them. Documentation for OMAPI objects can be found in
the documentation for the server that provides them - for
example, in the <b>dhcpd(1)</b> manual page and the
<b>dhclient(1)</b> manual page.</p>

<h2>CONTRIBUTIONS
<a name="CONTRIBUTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This software
is free software. At various times its development has been
underwritten by various organizations, including the ISC and
Vixie Enterprises. The development of 3.0 has been funded
almost entirely by Nominum, Inc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this point
development is being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and hosted by
the ISC, but the future of this project depends on you. If
you have features you want, please consider implementing
them.</p>

<h2>LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS
<a name="LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Throughout this
document, there are references to local and remote objects.
Local objects are ones created in omshell with the
<b>new</b> command. Remote objects are ones on the server:
leases, hosts, and groups that the DHCP server knows about.
Local and remote objects are associated together to enable
viewing and modification of object attributes. Also, new
remote objects can be created to match local objects.</p>

<h2>OPENING A CONNECTION
<a name="OPENING A CONNECTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">omshell is
started from the command line. Once omshell is started,
there are several commands that can be issued:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>server</b>
<i>address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">where address is the IP address
of the DHCP server to connect to. If this is not specified,
the default server is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>port</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">where number is the port that
OMAPI listens on. By default, this is 7911.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>key</b>
<i>name secret</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This specifies the TSIG key to
use to authenticate the OMAPI transactions. <i>name</i> is
the name of a key defined in <i>dhcpd.conf</i> with the
<b>omapi-key</b> statement. The <i>secret</i> is the secret
key generated from <b>dnssec-keygen</b> or another key
generation program.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>connect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This starts the OMAPI
connection to the server as specified by the <i>server</i>
statement.</p>

<h2>CREATING LOCAL OBJECTS
<a name="CREATING LOCAL OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any object
defined in OMAPI can be created, queried, and/or modified.
The object types available to OMAPI are defined in
<b>dhcpd(8)</b> and <b>dhclient(8)</b>. When using omshell,
objects are first defined locally, manipulated as desired,
and then associated with an object on the server. Only one
object can be manipulated at a time. To create a local
object, use</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>new</b>
<i>object-type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><i>object-type</i> is one of
group, host, or lease.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this point,
you now have an object that you can set properties on. For
example, if a new lease object was created with <i>new
lease</i>, any of a lease&rsquo;s attributes can be set as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set</b>
<i>attribute-name = value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>Attribute</b> names are
defined in <b>dhcpd(8)</b> and <b>dhclient(8)</b>. Values
should be quoted if they are strings. So, to set a
lease&rsquo;s IP address, you would do the following:
<b><br>
set ip-address = 192.168.4.50</b></p>

<h2>ASSOCIATING LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS
<a name="ASSOCIATING LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this point,
you can query the server for information about this lease,
by</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>open</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, the local
lease object you created and set the IP address for is
associated with the corresponding lease object on the DHCP
server. All of the lease attributes from the DHCP server are
now also the attributes on the local object, and will be
shown in omshell.</p>

<h2>VIEWING A REMOTE OBJECT
<a name="VIEWING A REMOTE OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To query a
lease of address 192.168.4.50, and find out its attributes,
after connecting to the server, take the following
steps:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>new
lease</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
new local lease object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set
ip-address = 192.168.4.50</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This sets the
<i>local</i> object&rsquo;s IP address to be
192.168.4.50</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>open</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, if a lease
with that IP address exists, you will see all the
information the DHCP server has about that particular lease.
Any data that isn&rsquo;t readily printable text will show
up in colon-separated hexadecimal values. In this example,
output back from the server for the entire transaction might
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&gt; new
&quot;lease&quot; <br>
obj: lease <br>
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.50 <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
&gt; open <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;wendelina&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see
here, the IP address is represented in hexadecimal, as are
the starting and ending times of the lease.</p>

<h2>MODIFYING A REMOTE OBJECT
<a name="MODIFYING A REMOTE OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attributes of
remote objects are updated by using the <b>set</b> command
as before, and then issuing an <b>update</b> command. The
<b>set</b> command sets the attributes on the current local
object, and the <b>update</b> command pushes those changes
out to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Continuing with
the previous example, if a <b>set client-hostname =
&quot;something-else&quot;</b> was issued, followed by an
<b>update</b> command, the output would look about like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&gt; set
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00 <br>
&gt; update <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<h2>NEW REMOTE OBJECTS
<a name="NEW REMOTE OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New remote
objects are created much in the same way that existing
server objects are modified. Create a local object using
<b>new</b>, set the attributes as you&rsquo;d wish them to
be, and then create the remote object with the same
properties by using</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>create</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now a new
object exists on the DHCP server which matches the
properties that you gave your local object. Objects created
via OMAPI are saved into the dhcpd.leases file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
a new host with the IP address of 192.168.4.40 needs to be
created it would be done as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&gt; new host
<br>
obj: host <br>
&gt; set name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
&gt; set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
&gt; set hardware-type = 1 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 1 <br>
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.40 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 1 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; create <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your
dhcpd.leases file would then have an entry like this in
it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">host some-host
{ <br>
dynamic; <br>
hardware ethernet 00:80:c7:84:b1:94; <br>
fixed-address 192.168.4.40; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>dynamic;</i> line is to denote that this host entry did
not come from dhcpd.conf, but was created dynamically via
OMAPI.</p>

<h2>RESETTING ATTRIBUTES
<a name="RESETTING ATTRIBUTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
remove an attribute from an object, you can do this with the
<b>unset</b> command. Once you have unset an attribute, you
must use the <b>update</b> command to update the remote
object. So, if the host &quot;some-host&quot; from the
previous example will not have a static IP address anymore,
the commands in omshell would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; unset ip-address <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = &lt;null&gt; <br>
&gt;</p>

<h2>REFRESHING OBJECTS
<a name="REFRESHING OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A local object
may be refreshed with the current remote object properties
using the <b>refresh</b> command. This is useful for object
that change periodically, like leases, to see if they have
been updated. This isn&rsquo;t particularly useful for
hosts.</p>

<h2>DELETING OBJECTS
<a name="DELETING OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any remote
object that can be created can also be destroyed. This is
done by creating a new local object, setting attributes,
associating the local and remote object using <b>open</b>,
and then using the <b>remove</b> command. If the host
&quot;some-host&quot; from before was created in error, this
could be corrected as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; remove <br>
obj: &lt;null&gt; <br>
&gt;</p>

<h2>HELP
<a name="HELP"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>help</b>
command will print out all of the commands available in
omshell, with some syntax pointers.</p>
