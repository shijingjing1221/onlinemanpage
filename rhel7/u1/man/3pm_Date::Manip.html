<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
&minus; Date manipulation routines</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip is
a series of modules designed to make any common date/time
operation easy to do. Operations such as comparing two
times, determining a data a given amount of time from
another, or parsing international times are all easily done.
It deals with time as it is used in the Gregorian calendar
(the one currently in use) with full support for time
changes due to daylight saving time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the very
beginning, the main focus of Date::Manip has been to be able
to do <small>ANY</small> desired date/time operation easily.
Many other modules exist which may do a subset of these
operations quicker or more efficiently, but no other module
can do all of the operations available in Date::Manip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since many
other date/time modules exist, some of which may do the
specific operation(s) you need faster, be sure to read the
section <small>SHOULD I USE DATE::MANIP</small> in the
Date::Manip::Misc document before deciding which of the Date
and Time modules from <small>CPAN</small> is for you.
However, if you want one module to do it all, Date::Manip is
the one to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip has
functionality to work with several fundamental types of
data. <b><br>
dates</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The word date is used
extensively here and is somewhat misleading. In Date::Manip,
a date consists of three pieces of information: a calendar
date, a time of day, and time zone information. Calendar
dates and times are fully handled. Time zones are handled as
well, but depending on how you use Date::Manip, there may be
some limitations as discussed below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delta</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A delta is an amount of time
(i.e. the amount of time between two different dates). A
delta refers only to an amount of time. It includes no
information about a starting or ending date/time. Most
people will think of a delta as an amount of time, but the
term &rsquo;time&rsquo; is already used so much in this
module that I didn&rsquo;t want to use it here in order to
avoid confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>recurrence</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A recurring event is something
which occurs on a regular recurring basis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>holidays</b> and
<b>events</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Holidays and events are
basically named dates or recurrences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Among other
things, Date::Manip allow you to:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p><b>*</b></p></td>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Compare two dates, entered in widely different formats
to determine which is earlier.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Extract any information you want from a date using a
format string similar to the Unix date command.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Determine the amount of time between two dates, or add
an amount of time to a date to get a second date.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Work with dates with dates using international formats
(foreign month names, 12/10/95 referring to October rather
than December, etc.).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>To find a list of dates where a recurring event
happens.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of these
tasks is trivial (one or two lines at most) with this
package.</p>

<h2>VERSION 5 AND VERSION 6
<a name="VERSION 5 AND VERSION 6"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
version 6.00 was a complete rewrite of the module (for more
information, please refer to the Date::Manip::Changes5to6
document). The rewrite made use of features introduced in
perl 5.10 which made the date parsing routines significantly
more robust. However, since not everyone has access to a new
version of perl where Date::Manip is needed, the Date::Manip
distribution actually includes two different versions of the
module. It includes the older (5.xx) release and the newer
(6.xx) release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the 6.xx release was written with both a functional and an
object-oriented interface, so there are actually three
different ways to use Date::Manip (though only one is
available if you have a version of perl older than
5.10).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For those who
still run an older version of perl, the 5.xx functional
interface is still available. It is known to work with perl
5.6 (and probably works with even older versions of perl).
There are some limitations to this as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 6.xx
was rewritten as a series of object-oriented modules, but a
functional interface (which is mostly backward compatible
with the version 5 functional interface) is included. The
functional interface is simply wrapper functions which call
the <small>OO</small> modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A more detailed
description of each interface is included below (to help you
decide which interface is right for you). If you already
know which interface you want to use, just go to the
<small>SEE ALSO</small> section below for instructions on
using each interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should be
noted that all three interfaces will be installed, but they
will only all be usable with a recent version of perl.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE (VERSION 5)
<a name="FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE (VERSION 5)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using a
version of perl older than 5.10, this is the only interface
available. This interface is documented in the
Date::Manip::DM5 document. This interface has several
weaknesses that need to be understood when using it: <b><br>
Limited Support</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The version 5 functional
interface is no longer being developed, and only limited
support is available for it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of December
2012, no development will be done, and I will not correct
any remaining bugs in version 5. If a patch is supplied by
someone else to fix bugs, I will apply it, provided it
applies cleanly, and the resulting code continues to pass
all tests. I will not apply patches to add features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I will continue
to distribute version 5 for several years. I do not have a
date in mind where version 5 will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Limited Time Zone
Support</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Time zone support is extremely
limited, and is often broken. The lack of good time zone
support was the primary reason for rewriting Date::Manip
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Time zone
information for 5.xx is now automatically generated from the
6.xx time zone list, and every time time zones are updated
in 6.xx, the 5.xx release will be similarly updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to the
release of 6.00, time zones were added manually to
Date::Manip upon request. Since time zone information in
5.xx is now automatically generated, I no longer take
requests for time zones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The version 5
interface does not handle daylight saving time changes
properly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Performance Issues</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Considerable time has been
spent speeding up Date::Manip, and fairly simple benchmarks
show that version 6 is around twice as fast as version
5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Feel free to
email me concerns and comments.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE (VERSION 6)
<a name="FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE (VERSION 6)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The version 6
functional interface is almost completely identical to the
version 5 functional interface, except that it uses the
object-oriented modules to do all the real work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Time zone
support is greatly improved, but is still somewhat limited.
Since the version 6 interface is backward compatible, dates
do not store time zone information in them, so the
programmer is responsible for keeping track of what time
zone each date is in. If you want full access to the time
zone support offered in Date::Manip, you have to use the
object-oriented interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the most
part, scripts written for older versions of Date::Manip will
continue to work (and scripts written for the version 6
functional interface will run with the version 5 interface),
however in a few cases, you may need to modify your scripts.
Please refer to the Date::Manip::Migration5to6 document for
a list of changes which may be necessary.</p>

<h2>OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
<a name="OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 6.00,
Date::Manip consists of a set of <small>OO</small> modules.
Each have their own document (see the <small>SEE
ALSO</small> section below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>OO</small> interface consists of the following
modules: Date::Manip::Date, Date::Manip::Delta,
Date::Manip::Recur, Date::Manip::TZ, and Date::Manip::Base
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
object-oriented interface is the only way to get the full
functionality of Date::Manip. It fully support time zones
(and daylight saving time).</p>

<h2>SELECTING AN INTERFACE
<a name="SELECTING AN INTERFACE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
running an older version of perl, the version 5 functional
interface is the only one available to you, and it will
automatically be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
running a newer version of perl (5.10 or higher), you can
use the object-oriented modules by loading them directly, or
you can use a functional interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use a
functional interface, it will default to the version 6
interface, but you can choose to run the version 5 interface
in one of three ways: <br>
Use the default functional interface</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By including:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   use Date::Manip;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">in your script,
one of the functional interfaces will be loaded. If you are
running a version of perl older than 5.10, it will
automatically be the version 5 interface. If you are running
a newer version of perl, it will automatically load the
version 6 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>DATE_MANIP ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By setting the
<small>DATE_MANIP</small> environment variable to &rsquo;
<small>DM5</small> &rsquo; before running the perl script,
the version 5 interface will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Date::Manip::Backend
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Alternately, you can set the
Date::Manip::Backend variable to be &rsquo;
<small>DM5</small> &rsquo; before loading the module.
Typically, this will be done in the following way:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   BEGIN {
        $Date::Manip::Backend = 'DM5';
   }
   use Date::Manip;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a
functional interface is loaded, you cannot switch between
the version 5 and version 6 interfaces.</p>
