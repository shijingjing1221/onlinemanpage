&minus; Service unit configuration</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>service</i>.service</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A unit
configuration file whose name ends in .service encodes
information about a process controlled and supervised by
systemd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
lists the configuration options specific to this unit type.
See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for the common options of all
unit configuration files. The common configuration items are
configured in the generic &quot;[Unit]&quot; and
&quot;[Install]&quot; sections. The service specific
configuration options are configured in the
&quot;[Service]&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
options are listed in <b>systemd.exec</b>(5), which define
the execution environment the commands are executed in, and
in <b>systemd.kill</b>(5), which define the way the
processes of the service are terminated, and in
<b>systemd.resource-control</b>(5), which configure resource
control settings for the processes of the service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> is set to <b>false</b>, service
units will implicitly have dependencies of type
<i>Requires=</i> and <i>After=</i> on basic.target as well
as dependencies of type <i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i>
on shutdown.target. These ensure that normal service units
pull in basic system initialization, and are terminated
cleanly prior to system shutdown. Only services involved
with early boot or late system shutdown should disable this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a service is
requested under a certain name but no unit configuration
file is found, systemd looks for a SysV init script by the
same name (with the .service suffix removed) and dynamically
creates a service unit from that script. This is useful for
compatibility with SysV. Note that this compatibility is
quite comprehensive but not 100%. For details about the
incompatibilities see the
<b><font color="#0000FF">Incompatibilities with
SysV</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">document.</font></p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Service
files must include a &quot;[Service]&quot; section, which
carries information about the service and the process it
supervises. A number of options that may be used in this
section are shared with other unit types. These options are
documented in <b>systemd.exec</b>(5) and
<b>systemd.kill</b>(5). The options specific to the
&quot;[Service]&quot; section of service units are the
following:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Type=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the process start&minus;up type for this service unit. One
of <b>simple</b>, <b>forking</b>, <b>oneshot</b>,
<b>dbus</b>, <b>notify</b> or <b>idle</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
set to <b>simple</b> (the default value if neither
<i>Type=</i> nor <i>BusName=</i> are specified), it is
expected that the process configured with <i>ExecStart=</i>
is the main process of the service. In this mode, if the
process offers functionality to other processes on the
system, its communication channels should be installed
before the daemon is started up (e.g. sockets set up by
systemd, via socket activation), as systemd will immediately
proceed starting follow&minus;up units.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
set to <b>forking</b>, it is expected that the process
configured with <i>ExecStart=</i> will call <b>fork()</b> as
part of its start&minus;up. The parent process is expected
to exit when start&minus;up is complete and all
communication channels are set up. The child continues to
run as the main daemon process. This is the behavior of
traditional UNIX daemons. If this setting is used, it is
recommended to also use the <i>PIDFile=</i> option, so that
systemd can identify the main process of the daemon. systemd
will proceed starting follow&minus;up units as soon as the
parent process exits.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Behavior
of <b>oneshot</b> is similar to <b>simple</b>, however it is
expected that the process has to exit before systemd starts
follow&minus;up units. <i>RemainAfterExit=</i> is
particularly useful for this type of service.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Behavior
of <b>dbus</b> is similar to <b>simple</b>, however it is
expected that the daemon acquires a name on the D&minus;Bus
bus, as configured by <i>BusName=</i>. systemd will proceed
starting follow&minus;up units after the D&minus;Bus bus
name has been acquired. Service units with this option
configured implicitly gain dependencies on the dbus.socket
unit. This type is the default if <i>BusName=</i> is
specified.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Behavior
of <b>notify</b> is similar to <b>simple</b>, however it is
expected that the daemon sends a notification message via
<b>sd_notify</b>(3) or an equivalent call when it finished
starting up. systemd will proceed starting follow&minus;up
units after this notification message has been sent. If this
option is used, <i>NotifyAccess=</i> (see below) should be
set to open access to the notification socket provided by
systemd. If <i>NotifyAccess=</i> is not set, it will be
implicitly set to <b>main</b>. Note that currently
<i>Type=</i><b>notify</b> will not work if used in
combination with
<i>PrivateNetwork=</i><b>yes</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Behavior
of <b>idle</b> is very similar to <b>simple</b>, however
actual execution of the service binary is delayed until all
jobs are dispatched. This may be used to avoid interleaving
of output of shell services with the status output on the
console.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>RemainAfterExit=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean value that specifies whether the service shall be
considered active even when all its processes exited.
Defaults to <b>no</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>GuessMainPID=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean value that specifies whether systemd should try to
guess the main PID of a service if it cannot be determined
reliably. This option is ignored unless <b>Type=forking</b>
is set and <b>PIDFile=</b> is unset because for the other
types or with an explicitly configured PID file the main PID
is always known. The guessing algorithm might come to
incorrect conclusions if a daemon consists of more than one
process. If the main PID cannot be determined, failure
detection and automatic restarting of a service will not
work reliably. Defaults to <b>yes</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>PIDFile=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes an
absolute file name pointing to the PID file of this daemon.
Use of this option is recommended for services where
<i>Type=</i> is set to <b>forking</b>. systemd will read the
PID of the main process of the daemon after start&minus;up
of the service. systemd will not write to the file
configured here.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>BusName=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
D&minus;Bus bus name, that this service is reachable as.
This option is mandatory for services where <i>Type=</i> is
set to <b>dbus</b>, but its use is otherwise recommended as
well if the process takes a name on the D&minus;Bus
bus.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ExecStart=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Commands
with their arguments that are executed when this service is
started. For each of the specified commands, the first
argument must be an absolute and literal path to an
executable.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<i>Type</i> is not <b>oneshot</b>, only one command may be
given. When <i>Type=oneshot</i> is used, more than one
command may be specified. Multiple command lines may be
concatenated in a single directive, by separating them with
semicolons (these semicolons must be passed as separate
words). Alternatively, this directive may be specified more
than once with the same effect. Lone semicolons may be
escaped as &quot;\;&quot;. If the empty string is assigned
to this option, the list of commands to start is reset,
prior assignments of this option will have no
effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Each
command line is split on whitespace, with the first item
being the command to execute, and the subsequent items being
the arguments. Double quotes (&quot;...&quot;) and single
quotes ('...') may be used, in which case everything until
the next matching quote becomes part of the same argument.
Quotes themselves are removed after parsing. In addition, a
trailing backslash (&quot;\&quot;) may be used to merge
lines. This syntax is intended to be very similar to shell
syntax, but only the meta&minus;characters and expansions
described in the following paragraphs are understood.
Specifically, redirection using &quot;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, and
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, pipes using &quot;|&quot;, and running
programs in the background using &quot;&amp;&quot; and
<i>other elements of shell syntax are not
supported</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
more than one command is specified, the commands are invoked
one by one sequentially in the order they appear in the unit
file. If one of the commands fails (and is not prefixed with
&quot;&minus;&quot;), other lines are not executed and the
unit is considered failed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Unless
<i>Type=forking</i> is set, the process started via this
command line will be considered the main process of the
daemon.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
command line accepts &quot;%&quot; specifiers as described
in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5). Note that the first argument of
the command line (i.e. the program to execute) may not
include specifiers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Basic
environment variable substitution is supported. Use
&quot;${FOO}&quot; as part of a word, or as a word of its
own on the command line, in which case it will be replaced
by the value of the environment variable including all
whitespace it contains, resulting in a single argument. Use
&quot;$FOO&quot; as a separate word on the command line, in
which case it will be replaced by the value of the
environment variable split at whitespace, resulting in zero
or more arguments. To pass a literal dollar sign, use
&quot;$$&quot;. Variables whose value is not known at
expansion time are treated as empty strings. Note that the
first argument (i.e. the program to execute) may not be a
variable.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Variables
to be used in this fashion may be defined through
<i>Environment=</i> and <i>EnvironmentFile=</i>. In
addition, variables listed in section &quot;Environment
variables in spawned processes&quot; in
<b>systemd.exec</b>(5) which are considered &quot;static
configuration&quot; may used (this includes e.g.
<i>$USER</i>, but not <i>$TERM</i>).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Optionally,
if the absolute file name is prefixed with &quot;@&quot;,
the second token will be passed as &quot;argv[0]&quot; to
the executed process, followed by the further arguments
specified. If the absolute filename is prefixed with
&quot;&minus;&quot;, an exit code of the command normally
considered a failure (i.e. non&minus;zero exit status or
abnormal exit due to signal) is ignored and considered
success. If both &quot;&minus;&quot; and &quot;@&quot; are
used, they can appear in either order.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that this setting does not directly support shell command
lines. If shell command lines are to be used, they need to
be passed explicitly to a shell implementation of some kind.
Example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">ExecStart=/bin/sh
&minus;c 'dmesg | tac'</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">ExecStart=/bin/echo
one ; /bin/echo &quot;two two&quot;</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
will execute <b>/bin/echo</b> two times, each time with one
argument, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two two&quot;,
respectively. Since two commands are specified,
<i>Type=oneshot</i> must be used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">ExecStart=/bin/echo
/ &gt;/dev/null &amp; \; \ <br>
/bin/ls</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
will execute <b>/bin/echo</b> with five arguments:
&quot;/&quot;, &quot;&gt;/dev/null&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;;&quot;, and &quot;/bin/ls&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Environment=&quot;ONE=one&quot;
'TWO=two two' <br>
ExecStart=/bin/echo $ONE $TWO ${TWO}</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
will execute <b>/bin/echo</b> with four arguments:
&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, and
&quot;two two&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ExecStartPre=</i>,
<i>ExecStartPost=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Additional
commands that are executed before or after the command in
<i>ExecStart=</i>, respectively. Syntax is the same as for
<i>ExecStart=</i>, except that multiple command lines are
allowed and the commands are executed one after the other,
serially.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
any of those commands (not prefixed with
&quot;&minus;&quot;) fail, the rest are not executed and the
unit is considered failed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ExecReload=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Commands
to execute to trigger a configuration reload in the service.
This argument takes multiple command lines, following the
same scheme as described for <i>ExecStart=</i> above. Use of
this setting is optional. Specifier and environment variable
substitution is supported here following the same scheme as
for <i>ExecStart=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">One
additional special environment variables is set: if known
<i>$MAINPID</i> is set to the main process of the daemon,
and may be used for command lines like the
following:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">/bin/kill
&minus;HUP $MAINPID</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
however that reloading a daemon by sending a signal (as with
the example line above) is usually not a good choice,
because this is an asynchronous operation and hence not
suitable to order reloads of multiple services against each
other. It is strongly recommended to set <i>ExecReload=</i>
to a command that no only triggers a configuration reload of
the daemon, but also synchronously waits for it
complete.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ExecStop=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Commands
to execute to stop the service started via
<i>ExecStart=</i>. This argument takes multiple command
lines, following the same scheme as described for
<i>ExecStart=</i> above. Use of this setting is optional.
All processes remaining for a service after the commands
configured in this option are run are terminated according
to the <i>KillMode=</i> setting (see
<b>systemd.kill</b>(5)). If this option is not specified,
the process is terminated right&minus;away when service stop
is requested. Specifier and environment variable
substitution is supported (including <i>$MAINPID</i>, see
above).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ExecStopPost=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Additional
commands that are executed after the service was stopped.
This includes cases where the commands configured in
<i>ExecStop=</i> were used, where the service does not have
any <i>ExecStop=</i> defined, or where the service exited
unexpectedly. This argument takes multiple command lines,
following the same scheme as described for <i>ExecStart</i>.
Use of these settings is optional. Specifier and environment
variable substitution is supported.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>RestartSec=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the time to sleep before restarting a service (as configured
with <i>Restart=</i>). Takes a unit&minus;less value in
seconds, or a time span value such as &quot;5min 20s&quot;.
Defaults to 100ms.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>TimeoutStartSec=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the time to wait for start&minus;up. If a daemon service
does not signal start&minus;up completion within the
configured time, the service will be considered failed and
be shut down again. Takes a unit&minus;less value in
seconds, or a time span value such as &quot;5min 20s&quot;.
Pass 0 to disable the timeout logic. Defaults to
<i>TimeoutStartSec=</i> in manager configuration file,
except when <i>Type=oneshot</i> is used in which case the
timeout is disabled by default.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>TimeoutStopSec=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the time to wait for stop. If a service is asked to stop but
does not terminate in the specified time, it will be
terminated forcibly via <b>SIGTERM</b>, and after another
delay of this time with <b>SIGKILL</b> (See <i>KillMode=</i>
in <b>systemd.kill</b>(5)). Takes a unit&minus;less value in
seconds, or a time span value such as &quot;5min 20s&quot;.
Pass 0 to disable the timeout logic. Defaults to
<i>TimeoutStartSec=</i> in manager configuration
file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>TimeoutSec=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
shorthand for configuring both <i>TimeoutStartSec=</i> and
<i>TimeoutStopSec=</i> to the specified value.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>WatchdogSec=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the watchdog timeout for a service. The watchdog is
activated when the start&minus;up is completed. The service
must call <b>sd_notify</b>(3) regularly with
&quot;WATCHDOG=1&quot; (i.e. the &quot;keep&minus;alive
ping&quot;). If the time between two such calls is larger
than the configured time, then the service is placed in a
failure state. By setting <i>Restart=</i> to
<b>on&minus;failure</b> or <b>always</b>, the service will
be automatically restarted. The time configured here will be
passed to the executed service process in the
<i>WATCHDOG_USEC=</i> environment variable. This allows
daemons to automatically enable the keep&minus;alive pinging
logic if watchdog support is enabled for the service. If
this option is used, <i>NotifyAccess=</i> (see below) should
be set to open access to the notification socket provided by
systemd. If <i>NotifyAccess=</i> is not set, it will be
implicitly set to <b>main</b>. Defaults to 0, which disables
this feature.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Restart=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
whether the service shall be restarted when the service
process exits, is killed, or a timeout is reached. The
service process may be the main service process, but also
one of the processes specified with <i>ExecStartPre=</i>,
<i>ExecStartPost=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i>,
<i>ExecStopPost=</i>, or <i>ExecReload=</i>. When the death
of the process is a result of systemd operation (e.g.
service stop or restart), the service will not be restarted.
Timeouts include missing the watchdog &quot;keep&minus;alive
ping&quot; deadline and a service start, reload, and stop
operation timeouts.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Takes
one of <b>no</b>, <b>on&minus;success</b>,
<b>on&minus;failure</b>, <b>on&minus;watchdog</b>,
<b>on&minus;abort</b>, or <b>always</b>. If set to <b>no</b>
(the default), the service will not be restarted. If set to
<b>on&minus;success</b>, it will be restarted only when the
service process exits cleanly. In this context, a clean exit
means an exit code of 0, or one of the signals
<b>SIGHUP</b>, <b>SIGINT</b>, <b>SIGTERM</b>, or
<b>SIGPIPE</b>, and additionally, exit statuses and signals
specified in <i>SuccessExitStatus=</i>. If set to
<b>on&minus;failure</b>, the service will be restarted when
the process exits with an nonzero exit code, is terminated
by a signal (including on core dump), when an operation
(such as service reload) times out, and when the configured
watchdog timeout is triggered. If set to
<b>on&minus;abort</b>, the service will be restarted only if
the service process exits due to an uncaught signal not
specified as a clean exit status. If set to
<b>on&minus;watchdog</b>, the service will be restarted only
if the watchdog timeout for the service expires. If set to
<b>always</b>, the service will be restarted regardless of
whether it exited cleanly or not, got terminated abnormally
by a signal or hit a timeout.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to the above settings, the service will not be
restarted if the exit code or signal is specified in
<i>RestartPreventExitStatus=</i> (see below).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>SuccessExitStatus=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
list of exit status definitions that when returned by the
main service process will be considered successful
termination, in addition to the normal successful exit code
0 and the signals <b>SIGHUP</b>, <b>SIGINT</b>,
<b>SIGTERM</b>, and <b>SIGPIPE</b>. Exit status definitions
can either be numeric exit codes or termination signal
names, separated by spaces. For example:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">SuccessExitStatus=1
2 8 <b>SIGKILL</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">ensures
that exit codes 1, 2, 8 and the termination signal
<b>SIGKILL</b> are considered clean service
terminations.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that if a process has a signal handler installed and exits
by calling <b>_exit</b>(2) in response to a signal, the
information about the signal is lost. Programs should
instead perform cleanup and kill themselves with the same
signal instead. See</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">Proper
handling of SIGINT/SIGQUIT &mdash; How to be a proper
program</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option may appear more than once in which case the list of
successful exit statuses is merged. If the empty string is
assigned to this option, the list is reset, all prior
assignments of this option will have no effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>RestartPreventExitStatus=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
list of exit status definitions that when returned by the
main service process will prevent automatic service restarts
regardless of the restart setting configured with
<i>Restart=</i>. Exit status definitions can either be
numeric exit codes or termination signal names, and are
separated by spaces. Defaults to the empty list, so that by
default no exit status is excluded from the configured
restart logic. Example: &quot;RestartPreventExitStatus=1 6
SIGABRT&quot;, ensures that exit codes 1 and 6 and the
termination signal SIGABRT will not result in automatic
service restarting. This option may appear more than once in
which case the list of restart preventing statuses is
merged. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the
list is reset, all prior assignments of this option will
have no effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>PermissionsStartOnly=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If true, the permission related execution
options as configured with <i>User=</i> and similar options
(see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for more information) are only
applied to the process started with <i>ExecStart=</i>, and
not to the various other <i>ExecStartPre=</i>,
<i>ExecStartPost=</i>, <i>ExecReload=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i>,
<i>ExecStopPost=</i> commands. If false, the setting is
applied to all configured commands the same way. Defaults to
false.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>RootDirectoryStartOnly=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If true, the root directory as configured
with the <i>RootDirectory=</i> option (see
<b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for more information) is only applied
to the process started with <i>ExecStart=</i>, and not to
the various other <i>ExecStartPre=</i>,
<i>ExecStartPost=</i>, <i>ExecReload=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i>,
<i>ExecStopPost=</i> commands. If false, the setting is
applied to all configured commands the same way. Defaults to
false.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>NonBlocking=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Set
O_NONBLOCK flag for all file descriptors passed via
socket&minus;based activation. If true, all file descriptors
&gt;= 3 (i.e. all except STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR) will have the
O_NONBLOCK flag set and hence are in non&minus;blocking
mode. This option is only useful in conjunction with a
socket unit, as described in <b>systemd.socket</b>(5).
Defaults to false.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>NotifyAccess=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Controls
access to the service status notification socket, as
accessible via the <b>sd_notify</b>(3) call. Takes one of
<b>none</b> (the default), <b>main</b> or <b>all</b>. If
<b>none</b>, no daemon status updates are accepted from the
service processes, all status update messages are ignored.
If <b>main</b>, only service updates sent from the main
process of the service are accepted. If <b>all</b>, all
services updates from all members of the service's control
group are accepted. This option should be set to open access
to the notification socket when using <i>Type=notify</i> or
<i>WatchdogSec=</i> (see above). If those options are used
but <i>NotifyAccess=</i> is not configured, it will be
implicitly set to <b>main</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Sockets=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specifies
the name of the socket units this service shall inherit the
sockets from when the service is started. Normally it should
not be necessary to use this setting as all sockets whose
unit shares the same name as the service (ignoring the
different suffix of course) are passed to the spawned
process.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the same socket may be passed to multiple processes at
the same time. Also note that a different service may be
activated on incoming traffic than inherits the sockets. Or
in other words: the <i>Service=</i> setting of .socket units
does not have to match the inverse of the <i>Sockets=</i>
setting of the .service it refers to.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option may appear more than once, in which case the list of
socket units is merged. If the empty string is assigned to
this option, the list of sockets is reset, all prior uses of
this setting will have no effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>StartLimitInterval=</i>,
<i>StartLimitBurst=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configure
service start rate limiting. By default, services which are
started more often than 5 times within 10s are not permitted
to start any more times until the 10s interval ends. With
these two options, this rate limiting may be modified. Use
<i>StartLimitInterval=</i> to configure the checking
interval (defaults to <i>DefaultStartLimitInterval=</i> in
manager configuration file, set to 0 to disable any kind of
rate limiting). Use <i>StartLimitBurst=</i> to configure how
many starts per interval are allowed (defaults to
<i>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</i> in manager configuration
file). These configuration options are particularly useful
in conjunction with <i>Restart=</i>, however apply to all
kinds of starts (including manual), not just those triggered
by the <i>Restart=</i> logic. Note that units which are
configured for <i>Restart=</i> and which reach the start
limit are not attempted to be restarted anymore, however
they may still be restarted manually at a later point from
which point on the restart logic is again activated. Note
that <b>systemctl reset&minus;failed</b> will cause the
restart rate counter for a service to be flushed, which is
useful if the administrator wants to manually start a
service and the start limit interferes with that.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>StartLimitAction=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configure
the action to take if the rate limit configured with
<i>StartLimitInterval=</i> and <i>StartLimitBurst=</i> is
hit. Takes one of <b>none</b>, <b>reboot</b>,
<b>reboot&minus;force</b> or <b>reboot&minus;immediate</b>.
If <b>none</b> is set, hitting the rate limit will trigger
no action besides that the start will not be permitted.
<b>reboot</b> causes a reboot following the normal shutdown
procedure (i.e. equivalent to <b>systemctl reboot</b>),
<b>reboot&minus;force</b> causes an forced reboot which will
terminate all processes forcibly but should cause no dirty
file systems on reboot (i.e. equivalent to <b>systemctl
reboot &minus;f</b>) and <b>reboot&minus;immediate</b>
causes immediate execution of the <b>reboot</b>(2) system
call, which might result in data loss. Defaults to
<b>none</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Check
<b>systemd.exec</b>(5) and <b>systemd.kill</b>(5) for more
settings.</font></p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
following options are also available in the
&quot;[Service]&quot; section, but exist purely for
compatibility reasons and should not be used in newly
written service files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>SysVStartPriority=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Set the
SysV start priority to use to order this service in relation
to SysV services lacking LSB headers. This option is only
necessary to fix ordering in relation to legacy SysV
services, that have no ordering information encoded in the
script headers. As such it should only be used as temporary
compatibility option, and not be used in new unit files.
Almost always it is a better choice to add explicit ordering
directives via <i>After=</i> or <i>Before=</i>, instead. For
more details see <b>systemd.unit</b>(5). If used, pass an
integer value in the range 0&minus;99.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>FsckPassNo=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Set the
fsck passno priority to use to order this service in
relation to other file system checking services. This option
is only necessary to fix ordering in relation to fsck jobs
automatically created for all /etc/fstab entries with a
value in the fs_passno column &gt; 0. As such it should only
be used as option for fsck services. Almost always it is a
better choice to add explicit ordering directives via
<i>After=</i> or <i>Before=</i>, instead. For more details
see <b>systemd.unit</b>(5). If used, pass an integer value
in the same range as /etc/fstab's fs_passno column. See
<b>fstab</b>(5) for details.</font></p>
