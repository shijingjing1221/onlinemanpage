<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sane&minus;abaton
&minus; SANE backend for Abaton flatbed scanners</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sane&minus;abaton</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Abaton
flatbed scanners. At present, only the Scan 300/GS (8bit,
256 levels of gray) is fully supported, due to the absence
of programming information. The Scan 300/S (black and white)
is recognized, but support for it is untested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you own a
Abaton scanner other than the ones listed above that works
with this backend, or if you own an Abaton scanner that does
not work with this backend, please contact
<i>sane&minus;devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</i> with the
model number, so that arrangements can be made to include
support for it. Have a look at
http://www.sane&minus;project.org/mailing&minus;lists.html
concerning subscription to sane&minus;devel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Abaton is out
of business, and these scanners are not supported by Everex
(the parent company of Abaton), nor is there any programming
information to be found. This driver is therefore based on
information obtained by running Abaton&rsquo;s scanning desk
accessory under MacsBug and tracing the MacOS SCSI Manager
calls it made during image acquisition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
protocol is very similar to, though not compatible with, the
one used by the Apple scanners, therefore, if this backend
is ever extended to support the other Abaton models (they
also made a color flatbed scanner), it may be possible to
fill in some &quot;missing pieces&quot; from the (quite
detailed) Apple scanner documentation.</p>

<h2>DEVICE NAMES
<a name="DEVICE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This backend
expects device names of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>special</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>special</i> is the path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the
special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
takes a format such as <i>/dev/sga</i> or <i>/dev/sg0</i>,
for example. See sane&minus;scsi(5) for details.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The contents of
the <i>abaton.conf</i> file is a list of device names that
correspond to Abaton scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See
sane&minus;scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
device name.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>/etc/sane.d/abaton.conf</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The backend configuration file
(see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;abaton.a</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The static library implementing
this backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane&minus;abaton.so</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&lsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&lsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SANE_DEBUG_ABATON</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
255 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a few
known ones, and definitely some unknown ones. <b><br>
Scan area miscalculations</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For the sake of programmer
efficiency, this backend handles all measurements in
millimetres, and floors (rather than rounds) values to avoid
possible damage to the scanner mechanism. Therefore, it may
not be possible to scan to the extreme right or bottom edges
of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Cancelling the scan</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This might not work correctly,
or it might abort the frontend. The former is more likely
than the latter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
found something that you think is a bug, please attempt to
recreate it with the SANE_DEBUG_ABATON environment variable
set to 255, and send a report detailing the conditions
surrounding the bug to
<i>sane&minus;devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</i>.</p>

<h2>TODO
<a name="TODO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implement
non-blocking support <br>
Finish reverse-engineering the MacOS driver</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This will allow me to add
support for other models with reasonable confidence that it
will work, as well as to fully exploit the information
returned by the INQUIRY command.</p>
