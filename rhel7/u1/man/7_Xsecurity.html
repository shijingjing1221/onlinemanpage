<h2>ACCESS SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS
<a name="ACCESS SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Host Access</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Any client on a host in the
host access control list is allowed access to the X server.
This system can work reasonably well in an environment where
everyone trusts everyone, or when only a single person can
log in to a given machine, and is easy to use when the list
of hosts used is small. This system does not work well when
multiple people can log in to a single machine and mutual
trust does not exist. The list of allowed hosts is stored in
the X server and can be changed with the <i>xhost</i>
command. The list is stored in the server by network
address, not host names, so is not automatically updated if
a host changes address while the server is running. When
using the more secure mechanisms listed below, the host list
is normally configured to be the empty list, so that only
authorized programs can connect to the display. See the
GRANTING ACCESS section of the <i>Xserver</i> man page for
details on how this list is initialized at server
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,
the client sends a 128 bit &quot;cookie&quot; along with the
connection setup information. If the cookie presented by the
client matches one that the X server has, the connection is
allowed access. The cookie is chosen so that it is hard to
guess; <i>xdm</i> generates such cookies automatically when
this form of access control is used. The user&rsquo;s copy
of the cookie is usually stored in the <i>.Xauthority</i>
file in the home directory, although the environment
variable <b>XAUTHORITY</b> can be used to specify an
alternate location. <i>Xdm</i> automatically passes a cookie
to the server for each new login session, and stores the
cookie in the user file at login.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The cookie is
transmitted on the network without encryption, so there is
nothing to prevent a network snooper from obtaining the data
and using it to gain access to the X server. This system is
useful in an environment where many users are running
applications on the same machine and want to avoid
interference from each other, with the caveat that this
control is only as good as the access control to the
physical network. In environments where network-level
snooping is difficult, this system can work reasonably
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sites who compile with DES
support can use a DES-based access control mechanism called
XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1. It is similar in usage to
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 in that a key is stored in the
<i>.Xauthority</i> file and is shared with the X server.
However, this key consists of two parts - a 56 bit DES
encryption key and 64 bits of random data used as the
authenticator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When connecting
to the X server, the application generates 192 bits of data
by combining the current time in seconds (since 00:00
1/1/1970 GMT) along with 48 bits of &quot;identifier&quot;.
For TCP/IPv4 connections, the identifier is the address plus
port number; for local connections it is the process ID and
32 bits to form a unique id (in case multiple connections to
the same server are made from a single process). This 192
bit packet is then encrypted using the DES key and sent to
the X server, which is able to verify if the requestor is
authorized to connect by decrypting with the same DES key
and validating the authenticator and additional data. This
system is useful in many environments where host-based
access control is inappropriate and where network security
cannot be ensured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SUN-DES-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Recent versions of SunOS (and
some other systems) have included a secure public key remote
procedure call system. This system is based on the notion of
a network principal; a user name and NIS domain pair. Using
this system, the X server can securely discover the actual
user name of the requesting process. It involves encrypting
data with the X server&rsquo;s public key, and so the
identity of the user who started the X server is needed for
this; this identity is stored in the <i>.Xauthority</i>
file. By extending the semantics of &quot;host address&quot;
to include this notion of network principal, this form of
access control is very easy to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To allow access
by a new user, use <i>xhost</i>. For example, <br>
xhost keith@ ruth@mit.edu <br>
adds &quot;keith&quot; from the NIS domain of the local
machine, and &quot;ruth&quot; in the &quot;mit.edu&quot; NIS
domain. For keith or ruth to successfully connect to the
display, they must add the principal who started the server
to their <i>.Xauthority</i> file. For example: <br>
xauth add expo.lcs.mit.edu:0 SUN-DES-1
unix.expo.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu <br>
This system only works on machines which support Secure RPC,
and only for users which have set up the appropriate
public/private key pairs on their system. See the Secure RPC
documentation for details. To access the display from a
remote host, you may have to do a <i>keylogin</i> on the
remote host first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Server Interpreted</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The Server Interpreted method
provides two strings to the X server for entry in the access
control list. The first string represents the type of entry,
and the second string contains the value of the entry. These
strings are interpreted by the server and different
implementations and builds may support different types of
entries. The types supported in the sample implementation
are defined in the SERVER INTERPRETED ACCESS TYPES section
below. Entries of this type can be manipulated via
<i>xhost</i>. For example to add a Server Interpreted entry
of type localuser with a value of root, the command is
<b>xhost +si:localuser:root</b>.</p>

<h2>THE AUTHORIZATION FILE
<a name="THE AUTHORIZATION FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except for Host
Access control and Server Interpreted Access Control, each
of these systems uses data stored in the <i>.Xauthority</i>
file to generate the correct authorization information to
pass along to the X server at connection setup.
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 and XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 store secret data
in the file; so anyone who can read the file can gain access
to the X server. SUN-DES-1 stores only the identity of the
principal who started the server
(unix.<i>hostname</i>@<i>domain</i> when the server is
started by <i>xdm</i>), and so it is not useful to anyone
not authorized to connect to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each entry in
the <i>.Xauthority</i> file matches a certain connection
family (TCP/IP, DECnet or local connections) and X display
name (hostname plus display number). This allows multiple
authorization entries for different displays to share the
same data file. A special connection family (FamilyWild,
value 65535) causes an entry to match every display,
allowing the entry to be used for all connections. Each
entry additionally contains the authorization name and
whatever private authorization data is needed by that
authorization type to generate the correct information at
connection setup time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>xauth</i> program manipulates the <i>.Xauthority</i> file
format. It understands the semantics of the connection
families and address formats, displaying them in an easy to
understand format. It also understands that SUN-DES-1 uses
string values for the authorization data, and displays them
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The X server
(when running on a workstation) reads authorization
information from a file name passed on the command line with
the <i>&minus;auth</i> option (see the <i>Xserver</i> manual
page). The authorization entries in the file are used to
control access to the server. In each of the authorization
schemes listed above, the data needed by the server to
initialize an authorization scheme is identical to the data
needed by the client to generate the appropriate
authorization information, so the same file can be used by
both processes. This is especially useful when <i>xinit</i>
is used. <br>
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This system uses 128 bits of
data shared between the user and the X server. Any
collection of bits can be used. <i>Xdm</i> generates these
keys using a cryptographically secure pseudo random number
generator, and so the key to the next session cannot be
computed from the current session key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This system uses two pieces of
information. First, 64 bits of random data, second a 56 bit
DES encryption key (again, random data) stored in 8 bytes,
the last byte of which is ignored. <i>Xdm</i> generates
these keys using the same random number generator as is used
for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SUN-DES-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This system needs a string
representation of the principal which identifies the
associated X server. This information is used to encrypt the
client&rsquo;s authority information when it is sent to the
X server. When <i>xdm</i> starts the X server, it uses the
root principal for the machine on which it is running
(unix.<i>hostname</i>@<i>domain</i>, e.g.,
&quot;unix.expire.lcs.mit.edu@our.domain.edu&quot;). Putting
the correct principal name in the <i>.Xauthority</i> file
causes Xlib to generate the appropriate authorization
information using the secure RPC library.</p>

<h2>SERVER INTERPRETED ACCESS TYPES
<a name="SERVER INTERPRETED ACCESS TYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sample
implementation includes several Server Interpreted
mechanisms:</p>

<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A literal IPv6 address as defined in IETF RFC 3513. This
allows adding IPv6 addresses when the X server supports
IPv6, but the xhost client was compiled without IPv6
support.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hostname</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value must be a hostname as
defined in IETF RFC 2396. Due to Mobile IP and dynamic DNS,
the name service is consulted at connection authentication
time, unlike the traditional host access control list which
only contains numeric addresses and does not automatically
update when a host&rsquo;s address changes. Note that this
definition of hostname does not allow use of literal IP
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">localuser &amp; localgroup</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">On systems which can determine
in a secure fashion the credentials of a client process, the
&quot;localuser&quot; and &quot;localgroup&quot;
authentication methods provide access based on those
credentials. The format of the values provided is platform
specific. For POSIX &amp; UNIX platforms, if the value
starts with the character &rsquo;#&rsquo;, the rest of the
string is treated as a decimal uid or gid, otherwise the
string is defined as a user name or group name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If your system
supports this method and you use it, be warned that some
programs that proxy connections and are setuid or setgid may
get authenticated as the uid or gid of the proxy process.
For instance, some versions of ssh will be authenticated as
the user root, no matter what user is running the ssh
client, so on systems with such software, adding access for
localuser:root may allow wider access than intended to the X
display.</p>
