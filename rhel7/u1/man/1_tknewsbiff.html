<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff
&minus; pop up a window when news appears</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tknewsbiff</b>
[ <i>server or config-file</i> ]</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tknewsbiff</b>
pops up a window when there is unread news in your favorite
newsgroups and removes the window after you&rsquo;ve read
the news. tknewsbiff can optionally play a sound, start your
newsreader, etc.</p>

<h2>SELECTING NEWSGROUPS
<a name="SELECTING NEWSGROUPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
configuration file ~/.tknewsbiff describes how tknewsbiff
behaves. The syntax observes the usual Tcl rules - however,
even if you don&rsquo;t know Tcl, all but the most esoteric
configurations will be obvious.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each newsgroup
(or set of newsgroups) to be watched is described by using
the &quot;watch&quot; command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining
<br>
watch nist.* <br>
watch comp.unix.wizard -threshold 3 <br>
watch *.sources.* -threshold 20</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each
newsgroup pattern, any newsgroup that matches it and which
you are subscribed to (according to your newsrc file) is
eligible for reporting. By default, tknewsbiff reports on
the newsgroup if there is at least one unread article. The
&quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the threshold to the
following number. For example, &quot;-threshold 3&quot;
means there must be at least three articles unread before
tknewsbiff will report the newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no watch
commands are given (or no configuration file exists), all
groups which are subscribed to are watched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To suppress
newsgroups that would otherwise be reported, use the
&quot;ignore&quot; command. For example, the following
matches all comp.* and nist.* newgroups except for
nist.posix or .d (discussion) groups:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch comp.*
<br>
watch nist.* <br>
ignore nist.posix.* <br>
ignore *.d</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The flag
&quot;-new&quot; describes a command to be executed when the
newsgroup is first reported as having unread news. For
example, the following lines invoke the UNIX command
&quot;play&quot; to play a sound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining
-new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot; <br>
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;exec play
/usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can cut
down on the verbosity of actions by defining procedures. For
example, if you have many -new flags that all play sound
files, you could define a sound procedure. This would allow
the -new specification to be much shorter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">proc play
{sound} {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>exec play /usr/local/sounds/$sound.au</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining
-new &quot;play yumyum&quot; <br>
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an aside,
you can put an &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of an
&quot;exec&quot; command to get commands to execute
asynchronously. However, it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea
to do this when playing sound files anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;newsgroup&quot;
is a read-only variable which contains the name of the
newsgroup that is being reported. This is useful when the
action is triggered by a pattern. For example, the following
line could run the newsgroup name through a speech
synthesizer:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch * -new
{</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>exec play herald.au</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>exec speak &quot;New news has arrived in
$newsgroup.&quot;</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The flag
&quot;&minus;display&quot; describes a command to be
executed every time the newsgroup is reported as having
unread news. The special command &quot;display&quot; is the
default command. It schedules $newsgroup to be written to
tknewsbiff&rsquo;s display when it is rewritten. For
example, by explicitly providing a -display flag that omits
the display command, you can disable the display of
newsgroups that are already reported via -new.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining
-new {exec play yumyum.au} -display {}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
execute an action repeatedly and <i>still</i> display the
newsgroup in the default manner, explicitly invoke the
display command via the -display flag. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">watch
*security* -display {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>exec play red-alert.au</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>display</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Actions
associated with the -new and -display flags are executed
only once for each matching newsgroup. The command executed
is the one associated with the first pattern in the
configuration file that matches and observes the given
threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any command
that is simply listed in the configuration file is executed
each time before the update loop in tknewsbiff. The reserved
(but user-defined) procedure &quot;user&quot; is run
immediately after the newsgroups are scheduled to be written
to the display and before they are actually written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
suppose unread articles appear in several rec.auto groups
and you play the same sound for each one. To prevent playing
the sound several times in a row, make the -new command
simply set a flag. In the user procedure, play the sound if
the flag is set (and then reset the flag).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user
procedure could also be used to start a newsreader. This
would avoid the possibility of starting multiple newsreaders
just because multiple newsgroups contained unread articles.
(A check should, of course, be made to make sure that a
newsreader is not already running.)</p>

<h2>MORE VARIABLES
<a name="MORE VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example lines show variables that can affect the behavior of
tknewsbiff</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">set delay 120
<br>
set server news.nist.gov <br>
set server_timeout 60 <br>
set newsrc ~/.newsrc <br>
set width 40 <br>
set height 20 <br>
set active_file /usr/news/lib/active</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff
alternates between checking for unread news and sleeping
(kind of like many undergraduates). The &quot;delay&quot;
variable describes how many seconds to sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;server&quot; variable names an NNTP news-server. The
default is &quot;news&quot;. The &quot;server&quot; variable
is only used if the &quot;active_file&quot; variable is not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;server_timeout&quot; variable describes how how many
seconds to wait for a response from the server before giving
up. -1 means wait forever or until the server itself times
out. The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;newsrc&quot; variable describes the name of your
.newsrc file. By default, tknewsbiff looks in your home
directory for a newsrc file. A server-specific newsrc is
used if found. For example, if you have set server to
&quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then tknewsbiff looks for
~/.newsrc-cubit.nist.gov. (This is the Emacs gnus convention
- which is very convenient when you read news from multiple
servers.) If there is no server-specific newsrc, tknewsbiff
uses ~/.newsrc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;width&quot; variable describes the width that
tknewsbiff will use to display information. If any newsgroup
names are long enough, they will be truncated so that the
article counts can still be shown. You can manually resize
the window to see what was truncated. However, if your
configuration file sets the width variable, the window will
be restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff
checks for unread news and updates its display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;height&quot; variable describes the maximum height
that tknewsbiff will use to display information. If fewer
newsgroups are reported, tknewsbiff will shrink the window
appropriately. You can manually resize the window but if
your configuration file sets the height variable, the window
will be restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff
checks for unread news and updates its display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;active_file&quot; variable describes the name of the
news active file. If set, the active file is read directly
in preference to using NNTP (even if the &quot;server&quot;
variable is set). This is particularly useful for testing
out new configuration files since you can edit a fake active
file and then click button 2 to immediately see how
tknewsbiff responds (see BUTTONS below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable DOTDIR is set, then its value is used
as a directory in which to find all dotfiles instead of from
the home directory. In particular, this affects the
tknewsbiff configuration file and the .newsrc file (assuming
the newsrc variable is not set explicitly).</p>

<h2>WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS
<a name="WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To watch
multiple servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times. (Since you
need different .newsrc files and the servers have different
newsgroups and article numbers anyway, there is no point in
trying to do this in a single process.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can point
tknewsbiff at a different server with an appropriate
argument. The argument is tried both as a configuration file
name and as a suffix to the string
&quot;~/.tknewsbiff-&quot;. So if you want to watch the
server &quot;kidney&quot;, store the tknewsbiff
configuration information in ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;. The
following two commands will both use that configuration
file.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>tknewsbiff kidney</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In both cases,
the actual server to contact is set by the value of the
server variable in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
configuration file is found, the argument is used as the
server to contact. This allows tknewsbiff to be run with no
preparation whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the argument
is the special keyword &quot;active&quot; (or ends in
&quot;/active&quot;), it is used as the name of an active
file. This is in turn used to initialize the variable
&quot;active_file&quot; so that tknewsbiff reads from the
active file directly rather than using NNTP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Creating your
own active file is a convenient way of testing your
configuration file. For example, after running the following
command, you can repeatedly edit your active file and
trigger the update-now command (either by pressing button 2
or setting the delay variable very low) to see how
tknewsbiff responds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The active file
must follow the format of a real active file. The format is
one newsgroup per line. After the newsgroup name is the
number of the highest article, the lowest article. Lastly is
the letter y or m. m means the newsgroup is moderated. y
means posting is allowed.</p>

<h2>WINDOW
<a name="WINDOW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When unread
news is found, a window is popped up. The window lists the
names of the newsgroups and the number of unread articles in
each (unless suppressed by the -display flag). When there is
no longer any unread news, the window disappears (although
the process continues to run).</p>

<h2>BUTTONS
<a name="BUTTONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Button or key
bindings may be assigned by bind commands. Feel free to
change them. The default bind commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bind .list
&lt;1&gt; help <br>
bind .list &lt;2&gt; update-now <br>
bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default
button 1 (left) is bound to &quot;help&quot;. The help
command causes tknewsbiff to pop up a help window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
button 2 (middle) is bound to &quot;update-now&quot;. The
update-now command causes tknewsbiff to immediately check
for unread news. If your news server is slow or maintains a
very large number of newsgroups, or you have a large number
of patterns in your configuration file, tknewsbiff can take
considerable time before actually updating the window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
button 3 (right) is bound to &quot;unmapwindow&quot;. The
unmapwindow command causes tknewsbiff to remove the window
from the display until the next time it finds unread news.
(The mapwindow command causes tknewsbiff to restore the
window.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
here is a binding to pop up an xterm and run rn when you
hold down the shift key and press button 1 in the listing
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bind .list
&lt;Shift-1&gt; {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>exec xterm -e rn &amp;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
similar binding. However it tells rn to look only at the
newsgroup that is under the mouse when you pressed it. (The
&quot;display_list&quot; variable is described later in this
man page.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bind .list
&lt;Shift-1&gt; {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>exec xterm -e rn [lindex $display_list [.list nearest
%y]] &amp;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">}</p>

<h2>OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES
<a name="OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Built-in
commands already mentioned are: watch, ignore, display,
help, update-now, unmapwindow, and mapwindow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any Tcl and Tk
command can also be given. In particular, the list of
newsgroups is stored in the list widget &quot;.list&quot;,
and the scroll bar is stored in the scrollbar widget
&quot;.scroll&quot;. So for example, if you want to change
the foreground and background colors of the newsgroup list,
you can say:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">.list config
-bg honeydew1 -fg orchid2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These can also
be controlled by the X resource database as well. However,
the configuration file allows arbitrarily complex commands
to be evaluated rather than simple assignments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain Tcl/Tk
commands can disrupt proper function of tknewsbiff. These
will probably be obvious to anyone who knows enough to give
these commands in the first place. As a simple example, the
program assumes the font in the list box is of fixed width.
The newsgroups will likely not align if you use a
variable-width font.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
variables are accessible and can be used for esoteric uses.
All other variables are private. Private variables and
commands begin with &quot;_&quot; so you don&rsquo;t need to
worry about accidental collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The array
&quot;db&quot; is a database which maintains information
about read and unread news. db($newsgroup,hi) is the highest
article that exists. db($newsgroup,seen) is the highest
article that you have read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A number of
lists maintain interesting information.
&quot;active_list&quot; is a list of known newsgroups.
&quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of newsgroups that have been
seen so far as the -new and -display flags are being
processed. &quot;previous_seen_list&quot; is
&quot;seen_list&quot; from the previous cycle.
&quot;ignore_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup patterns to
ignore. &quot;watch_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup
patterns to watch. &quot;display_list&quot; is the list of
newsgroup will be displayed at the next opportunity.</p>

<h2>UPDATING YOUR FILES
<a name="UPDATING YOUR FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff
automatically rereads your configuration file each time it
wakes up to check for unread news. To force tknewsbiff to
reread the file immediately (such as if you are testing a
new configuration or have just modified your newsrc file),
press button 2 in the display (see BUTTONS above).</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff
defines the number of unread articles as the highest
existing article minus the highest article that you&rsquo;ve
read. So if you&rsquo;ve read the last article in the
newsgroup but no others, tknewsbiff thinks there are no
unread articles. (It&rsquo;s impossible to do any better by
reading the active file and it would be very time consuming
to do this more accurately via NNTP since servers provide no
efficient way of reporting their own holes in the
newsgroups.) Fortunately, this definition is considered a
feature by most people. It allows you to read articles and
then mark them &quot;unread&quot; but not have tknewsbiff
continue telling you that they are unread.</p>

<h2>UNWARRANTED CONCERNS
<a name="UNWARRANTED CONCERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your news
administrator may wonder if many people using tknewsbiff
severely impact an NNTP server. In fact, the impact is
negligible even when the delay is very low. To gather all
the information it needs, tknewsbiff uses a single NNTP
query - it just asks for the active file. The NNTP server
does no computation, formatting, etc, it just sends the
file. All the interesting processing happens locally in the
tknewsbiff program itself.</p>
