&minus; Alex van den Bogaerdt&rsquo;s RRDtool tutorial</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RRDtool is
written by Tobias Oetiker &lt;tobi@oetiker.ch&gt; with
contributions from many people all around the world. This
document is written by Alex van den Bogaerdt
&lt;alex@vandenbogaerdt.nl&gt; to help you understand what
RRDtool is and what it can do for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
documentation provided with RRDtool can be too technical for
some people. This tutorial is here to help you understand
the basics of RRDtool. It should prepare you to read the
documentation yourself. It also explains the general things
about statistics with a focus on networking.</p>

<h2>TUTORIAL
<a name="TUTORIAL"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Important</b>
<br>
Please don&rsquo;t skip ahead in this document! The first
part of this document explains the basics and may be boring.
But if you don&rsquo;t understand the basics, the examples
will not be as meaningful to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes
things change. This example used to provide numbers like
&quot;0.04&quot; in stead of &quot;4.00000e&minus;02&quot;.
Those are really the same numbers, just written down
differently. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed if a future version of
rrdtool displays a slightly different form of output. The
examples in this document are correct for version 1.2.0 of
RRDtool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, sometimes
bugs do occur. They may also influence the outcome of the
examples. Example speed4.png was suffering from this (the
handling of unknown data in an if-statement was wrong).
Normal data will be just fine (a bug in rrdtool
wouldn&rsquo;t last long) but special cases like NaN,
<small>INF</small> and so on may last a bit longer. Try
another version if you can, or just live with it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I fixed the
speed4.png example (and added a note). There may be other
examples which suffer from the same or a similar bug. Try to
fix it yourself, which is a great excercise. But please do
not submit your result as a fix to the source of this
document. Discuss it on the user&rsquo;s list, or write to
me.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
RRDtool?</b> <br>
RRDtool refers to Round Robin Database tool. Round robin is
a technique that works with a fixed amount of data, and a
pointer to the current element. Think of a circle with some
dots plotted on the edge. These dots are the places where
data can be stored. Draw an arrow from the center of the
circle to one of the dots; this is the pointer. When the
current data is read or written, the pointer moves to the
next element. As we are on a circle there is neither a
beginning nor an end, you can go on and on and on. After a
while, all the available places will be used and the process
automatically reuses old locations. This way, the dataset
will not grow in size and therefore requires no maintenance.
RRDtool works with Round Robin Databases (RRDs). It stores
and retrieves data from them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What data
can be put into an <small>RRD</small> ?</b> <br>
You name it, it will probably fit as long as it is some sort
of time-series data. This means you have to be able to
measure some value at several points in time and provide
this information to RRDtool. If you can do this, RRDtool
will be able to store it. The values must be numerical but
don&rsquo;t have to be integers, as is the case with
<small>MRTG</small> (the next section will give more details
on this more specialized application).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many examples
below talk about <small>SNMP</small> which is an acronym for
Simple Network Management Protocol. &quot;Simple&quot;
refers to the protocol. It does not mean it is simple to
manage or monitor a network. After working your way through
this document, you should know enough to be able to
understand what people are talking about. For now, just
realize that <small>SNMP</small> can be used to query
devices for the values of counters they keep. It is the
value from those counters that we want to store in the
<small>RRD</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What can I
do with this tool?</b> <br>
RRDtool originated from <small>MRTG</small> (Multi Router
Traffic Grapher). <small>MRTG</small> started as a tiny
little script for graphing the use of a university&rsquo;s
connection to the Internet. <small>MRTG</small> was later
(ab&minus;)used as a tool for graphing other data sources
including temperature, speed, voltage, number of printouts
and the like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most likely you
will start to use RRDtool to store and process data
collected via <small>SNMP</small> . The data will most
likely be bytes (or bits) transferred from and to a network
or a computer. But it can also be used to display tidal
waves, solar radiation, power consumption, number of
visitors at an exhibition, noise levels near an airport,
temperature on your favorite holiday location, temperature
in the fridge and whatever your imagination can come up
with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You only need a
sensor to measure the data and be able to feed the numbers
into RRDtool. RRDtool then lets you create a database, store
data in it, retrieve that data and create graphs in
<small>PNG</small> format for display on a web browser.
Those <small>PNG</small> images are dependent on the data
you collected and could be, for instance, an overview of the
average network usage, or the peaks that occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What if I
still have problems after reading this document?</b> <br>
First of all: read it again! You may have missed something.
If you are unable to compile the sources and you have a
fairly common <small>OS</small> , it will probably not be
the fault of RRDtool. There may be pre-compiled versions
around on the Internet. If they come from trusted sources,
get one of those.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If on the other
hand the program works but does not give you the expected
results, it will be a problem with configuring it. Review
your configuration and compare it with the examples that
follow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
mailing list and an archive of it. Read the list for a few
weeks and search the archive. It is considered rude to just
ask a question without searching the archives: your problem
may already have been solved for somebody else! This is true
for most, if not all, mailing lists and not only for this
particular one. Look in the documentation that came with
RRDtool for the location and usage of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I suggest you
take a moment to subscribe to the mailing list right now by
sending an email to
&lt;rrd&minus;users&minus;request@lists.oetiker.ch&gt; with
a subject of &quot;subscribe&quot;. If you ever want to
leave this list, just write an email to the same address but
now with a subject of &quot;unsubscribe&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How will you
help me?</b> <br>
By giving you some detailed descriptions with detailed
examples. I assume that following the instructions in the
order presented will give you enough knowledge of RRDtool to
experiment for yourself. If it doesn&rsquo;t work the first
time, don&rsquo;t give up. Reread the stuff that you did
understand, you may have missed something.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By following
the examples you get some hands-on experience and, even more
important, some background information of how it works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will need
to know something about hexadecimal numbers. If you
don&rsquo;t then start with reading bin_dec_hex before you
continue here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Your first
Round Robin Database</b> <br>
In my opinion the best way to learn something is to actually
do it. Why not start right now? We will create a database,
put some values in it and extract this data again. Your
output should be the same as the output that is included in
this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We will start
with some easy stuff and compare a car with a router, or
compare kilometers (miles if you wish) with bits and bytes.
It&rsquo;s all the same: some number over some time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assume we have
a device that transfers bytes to and from the Internet. This
device keeps a counter that starts at zero when it is turned
on, increasing with every byte that is transferred. This
counter will probably have a maximum value. If this value is
reached and an extra byte is counted, the counter starts
over at zero. This is the same as many counters in the world
such as the mileage counter in a car.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
discussions about networking talk about bits per second so
lets get used to that right away. Assume a byte is eight
bits and start to think in bits not bytes. The counter,
however, still counts bytes! In the <small>SNMP</small>
world most of the counters are 32 bits. That means they are
counting from 0 to 4294967295. We will use these values in
the examples. The device, when asked, returns the current
value of the counter. We know the time that has passes since
we last asked so we now know how many bytes have been
transferred ***on average*** per second. This is not very
hard to calculate. First in words, then in calculations:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Take the current counter, subtract the previous value
from it.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Do the same with the current time and the previous time
(in seconds).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Divide the outcome of (1) by the outcome of (2), the
result is the amount of bytes per second. Multiply by eight
to get the number of bits per second (bps).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  bps = (counter_now &minus; counter_before) / (time_now &minus; time_before) * 8</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For some people
it may help to translate this to an automobile example. Do
not try this example, and if you do, don&rsquo;t blame me
for the results!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">People who are
not used to think in kilometers per hour can translate most
into miles per hour by dividing km by 1.6 (close enough). I
will use the following abbreviations:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> m:    meter
 km:   kilometer (= 1000 meters).
 h:    hour
 s:    second
 km/h: kilometers per hour
 m/s:  meters per second</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are driving
a car. At 12:05 you read the counter in the dashboard and it
tells you that the car has moved 12345 km until that moment.
At 12:10 you look again, it reads 12357 km. This means you
have traveled 12 km in five minutes. A scientist would
translate that into meters per second and this makes a nice
comparison toward the problem of (bytes per five minutes)
versus (bits per second).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We traveled 12
kilometers which is 12000 meters. We did that in five
minutes or 300 seconds. Our speed is 12000m / 300s or 40
m/s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We could also
calculate the speed in km/h: 12 times 5 minutes is an hour,
so we have to multiply 12 km by 12 to get 144 km/h. For our
native English speaking friends: that&rsquo;s 90 mph so
don&rsquo;t try this example at home or where I live :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember: these
numbers are averages only. There is no way to figure out
from the numbers, if you drove at a constant speed. There is
an example later on in this tutorial that explains this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I hope you
understand that there is no difference in calculating m/s or
bps; only the way we collect the data is different. Even the
k from kilo is the same as in networking terms k also means
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We will now
create a database where we can keep all these interesting
numbers. The method used to start the program may differ
slightly from <small>OS</small> to <small>OS</small> , but I
assume you can figure it out if it works different on
your&rsquo;s. Make sure you do not overwrite any file on
your system when executing the following command and type
the whole line as one long line (I had to split it for
readability) and skip all of the &rsquo;\&rsquo;
characters.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   rrdtool create test.rrd             \
            &minus;&minus;start 920804400          \
            DS:speed:COUNTER:600:U:U   \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:24       \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:6:10</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(So enter:
<tt>&quot;rrdtool create test.rrd &minus;&minus;start
920804400 DS ...&quot;</tt>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What has
been created?</b> <br>
We created the round robin database called test (test.rrd)
which starts at noon the day I started writing this
document, 7th of March, 1999 (this date translates to
920804400 seconds as explained below). Our database holds
one data source ( <small>DS</small> ) named
&quot;speed&quot; that represents a counter. This counter is
read every five minutes (this is the default therefore you
don&rsquo;t have to put
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;step=300&quot;</tt>). In the same
database two round robin archives (RRAs) are kept, one
averages the data every time it is read (e.g., there&rsquo;s
nothing to average) and keeps 24 samples (24 times 5 minutes
is 2 hours). The other averages 6 values (half hour) and
contains 10 such averages (e.g. 5 hours).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RRDtool works
with special time stamps coming from the <small>UNIX</small>
world. This time stamp is the number of seconds that passed
since January 1st 1970 <small>UTC</small> . The time stamp
value is translated into local time and it will therefore
look different for different time zones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Chances are
that you are not in the same part of the world as I am. This
means your time zone is different. In all examples where I
talk about time, the hours may be wrong for you. This has
little effect on the results of the examples, just correct
the hours while reading. As an example: where I will see
&quot;12:05&quot; the <small>UK</small> folks will see
&quot;11:05&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We now have to
fill our database with some numbers. We&rsquo;ll pretend to
have read the following numbers:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 12:05  12345 km
 12:10  12357 km
 12:15  12363 km
 12:20  12363 km
 12:25  12363 km
 12:30  12373 km
 12:35  12383 km
 12:40  12393 km
 12:45  12399 km
 12:50  12405 km
 12:55  12411 km
 13:00  12415 km
 13:05  12420 km
 13:10  12422 km
 13:15  12423 km</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We fill the
database as follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> rrdtool update test.rrd 920804700:12345 920805000:12357 920805300:12363
 rrdtool update test.rrd 920805600:12363 920805900:12363 920806200:12373
 rrdtool update test.rrd 920806500:12383 920806800:12393 920807100:12399
 rrdtool update test.rrd 920807400:12405 920807700:12411 920808000:12415
 rrdtool update test.rrd 920808300:12420 920808600:12422 920808900:12423</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This reads:
update our test database with the following numbers</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> time 920804700, value 12345
 time 920805000, value 12357</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">etcetera.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
it is possible to feed more than one value into the database
in one command. I had to stop at three for readability but
the real maximum per line is <small>OS</small>
dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We can now
retrieve the data from our database using &quot;rrdtool
fetch&quot;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> rrdtool fetch test.rrd AVERAGE &minus;&minus;start 920804400 &minus;&minus;end 920809200</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should
return the following output:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">                          speed
 920804700: nan
 920805000: 4.0000000000e&minus;02
 920805300: 2.0000000000e&minus;02
 920805600: 0.0000000000e+00
 920805900: 0.0000000000e+00
 920806200: 3.3333333333e&minus;02
 920806500: 3.3333333333e&minus;02
 920806800: 3.3333333333e&minus;02
 920807100: 2.0000000000e&minus;02
 920807400: 2.0000000000e&minus;02
 920807700: 2.0000000000e&minus;02
 920808000: 1.3333333333e&minus;02
 920808300: 1.6666666667e&minus;02
 920808600: 6.6666666667e&minus;03
 920808900: 3.3333333333e&minus;03
 920809200: nan
 920809500: nan</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
might get more rows than you expect. The reason for this is
that you ask for a time range that ends on 920809200. The
number that is written behind 920809200: in the list above
covers the time range from 920808900 to 920809200,
<small>EXCLUDING</small> 920809200. Hence to be on the sure
side, you receive the entry from 920809200 to 920809500 as
well since it <small>INCLUDES</small> 920809200. You may
also see &quot;NaN&quot; instead of &quot;nan&quot; this is
<small>OS</small> dependent. &quot;NaN&quot; stands for
&quot;Not A Number&quot;. If your <small>OS</small> writes
&quot;U&quot; or &quot; <small>UNKN</small> &quot; or
something similar that&rsquo;s okay. If something else is
wrong, it will probably be due to an error you made
(assuming that my tutorial is correct of course :&minus;).
In that case: delete the database and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The meaning of
the above output will become clear below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Time to
create some graphics</b> <br>
Try the following command:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> rrdtool graph speed.png                                 \
         &minus;&minus;start 920804400 &minus;&minus;end 920808000               \
         DEF:myspeed=test.rrd:speed:AVERAGE              \
         LINE2:myspeed#FF0000</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
create speed.png which starts at 12:00 and ends at 13:00.
There is a definition of a variable called myspeed, using
the data from <small>RRA</small> &quot;speed&quot; out of
database &quot;test.rrd&quot;. The line drawn is 2 pixels
high and represents the variable myspeed. The color is red
(specified by its rgb-representation, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll
notice that the start of the graph is not at 12:00 but at
12:05. This is because we have insufficient data to tell the
average before that time. This will only happen when you
miss some samples, this will not happen a lot,
hopefully.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this has
worked: congratulations! If not, check what went wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The colors are
built up from red, green and blue. For each of the
components, you specify how much to use in hexadecimal where
00 means not included and <small>FF</small> means fully
included. The &quot;color&quot; white is a mixture of red,
green and blue: <small>FFFFFF</small> The &quot;color&quot;
black is all colors off: 000000</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   red     #FF0000
   green   #00FF00
   blue    #0000FF
   magenta #FF00FF     (mixed red with blue)
   gray    #555555     (one third of all components)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally
you can (with a recent RRDtool) add an alpha channel
(transparency). The default will be &quot; <small>FF</small>
&quot; which means non-transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>PNG</small> you just created can be displayed using
your favorite image viewer. Web browsers will display the
<small>PNG</small> via the <small>URL</small>
&quot;file:///the/path/to/speed.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Graphics
with some math</b> <br>
When looking at the image, you notice that the horizontal
axis is labeled 12:10, 12:20, 12:30, 12:40 and 12:50.
Sometimes a label doesn&rsquo;t fit (12:00 and 13:00 would
be likely candidates) so they are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The vertical
axis displays the range we entered. We provided kilometers
and when divided by 300 seconds, we get very small numbers.
To be exact, the first value was 12 (12357&minus;12345) and
divided by 300 this makes 0.04, which is displayed by
RRDtool as &quot;40 m&quot; meaning &quot;40/1000&quot;. The
&quot;m&quot; (milli) has nothing to do with meters (also
m), kilometers or millimeters! RRDtool doesn&rsquo;t know
about the physical units of our data, it just works with
dimensionless numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we had
measured our distances in meters, this would have been
(12357000&minus;12345000)/300 = 12000/300 = 40.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As most people
have a better feel for numbers in this range, we&rsquo;ll
correct that. We could recreate our database and store the
correct data, but there is a better way: we do some
calculations while creating the png file!</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   rrdtool graph speed2.png                           \

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: I need to
escape the multiplication operator * with a backslash. If I
don&rsquo;t, the operating system may interpret it and use
it for file name expansion. You could also place the line
within quotation marks like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It boils down
to: it is RRDtool which should see *, not your shell. And it
is your shell interpreting \, not RRDtool. You may need to
adjust examples accordingly if you happen to use an
operating system or shell which behaves differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After viewing
this <small>PNG</small> , you notice the &quot;m&quot;
(milli) has disappeared. This it what the correct result
would be. Also, a label has been added to the image. Apart
from the things mentioned above, the <small>PNG</small>
should look the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
calculations are specified in the <small>CDEF</small> part
above and are in Reverse Polish Notation (&quot;
<small>RPN</small> &quot;). What we requested RRDtool to do
is: &quot;take the data source myspeed and the number 1000;
multiply those&quot;. Don&rsquo;t bother with
<small>RPN</small> yet, it will be explained later on in
more detail. Also, you may want to read my tutorial on CDEFs
and Steve Rader&rsquo;s tutorial on <small>RPN</small> . But
first finish this tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hang on! If we
can multiply values with 1000, it should also be possible to
display kilometers per hour from the same data!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To change a
value that is measured in meters per second:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> Calculate meters per hour:     value * 3600
 Calculate kilometers per hour: value / 1000
 Together this makes:           value * (3600/1000) or value * 3.6</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In our example
database we made a mistake and we need to compensate for
this by multiplying with 1000. Applying that correction:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> value * 3.6  * 1000 == value * 3600</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now let&rsquo;s
create this <small>PNG</small> , and add some more magic
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: here we
use another means to escape the * operator by enclosing the
whole string in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This graph
looks much better. Speed is shown in km/h and there is even
an extra line with the maximum allowed speed (on the road I
travel on). I also changed the colors used to display speed
and changed it from a line into an area.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
calculations are more complex now. For speed measurements
within the speed limit they are:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   Check if kmh is greater than 100    ( kmh,100 ) GT
   If so, return 0, else kmh           ((( kmh,100 ) GT ), 0, kmh) IF</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For values
above the speed limit:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   Check if kmh is greater than 100    ( kmh,100 ) GT
   If so, return kmh, else return 0    ((( kmh,100) GT ), kmh, 0) IF</pre>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, all you
have to do is measure the values regularly and update the
database. When you want to view the data, recreate the PNGs
and make sure to refresh them in your browser. (Note: just
clicking reload may not be enough, especially when proxies
are involved. Try shift-reload or ctrl&minus;F5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Updates in

We&rsquo;ve already used the <tt>&quot;update&quot;</tt>
command: it took one or more parameters in the form of
&quot;&lt;time&gt;:&lt;value&gt;&quot;. You&rsquo;ll be glad
to know that you can specify the current time by filling in
a &quot;N&quot; as the time. Or you could use the
&quot;time&quot; function in Perl (the shortest example in
this tutorial):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   perl &minus;e 'print time, &quot;\n&quot; '</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How to run a

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is all.
Run the above script every five minutes. When you need to
know what the graphs look like, run the examples above. You
could put them in a script as well. After running that
script, view the page index.html we created above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Some words
on <small>SNMP</small></b> <br>
I can imagine very few people that will be able to get real
data from their car every five minutes. All other people
will have to settle for some other kind of counter. You
could measure the number of pages printed by a printer, for
example, the cups of coffee made by the coffee machine, a
device that counts the electricity used, whatever. Any
incrementing counter can be monitored and graphed using the
stuff you learned so far. Later on we will also be able to
monitor other types of values like temperature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many people
interested in RRDtool will use the counter that keeps track
of octets (bytes) transferred by a network device. So
let&rsquo;s do just that next. We will start with a
description of how to collect data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some people
will make a remark that there are tools which can do this
data collection for you. They are right! However, I feel it
is important that you understand they are not necessary.
When you have to determine why things went wrong you need to
know how they work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One tool used
in the example has been talked about very briefly in the
beginning of this document, it is called <small>SNMP</small>
. It is a way of talking to networked equipment. The tool I
use below is called &quot;snmpget&quot; and this is how it
works:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   snmpget device password OID</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   snmpget &minus;v[version] &minus;c[password] device OID</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For device you
substitute the name, or the <small>IP</small> address, of
your device. For password you use the &quot;community read
string&quot; as it is called in the <small>SNMP</small>
world. For some devices the default of &quot;public&quot;
might work, however this can be disabled, altered or
protected for privacy and security reasons. Read the
documentation that comes with your device or program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then there is
this parameter, called <small>OID</small> , which means
&quot;object identifier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you start
to learn about <small>SNMP</small> it looks very confusing.
It isn&rsquo;t all that difficult when you look at the
Management Information Base (&quot; <small>MIB</small>
&quot;). It is an upside-down tree that describes data, with
a single node as the root and from there a number of
branches. These branches end up in another node, they branch
out, etc. All the branches have a name and they form the
path that we follow all the way down. The branches that we
follow are named: iso, org, dod, internet, mgmt and
mib&minus;2. These names can also be written down as numbers
and are 1 3 6 1 2 1.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib&minus;2 (1.3.6.1.2.1)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a lot
of confusion about the leading dot that some programs use.
There is *no* leading dot in an <small>OID</small> .
However, some programs can use the above part of OIDs as a
default. To indicate the difference between abbreviated OIDs
and full OIDs they need a leading dot when you specify the
complete <small>OID</small> . Often those programs will
leave out the default portion when returning the data to
you. To make things worse, they have several default
prefixes ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ok, lets
continue to the start of our <small>OID:</small> we had
1.3.6.1.2.1 From there, we are especially interested in the
branch &quot;interfaces&quot; which has number 2 (e.g.,
1.3.6.1.2.1.2 or 1.3.6.1.2.1.interfaces).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, we have
to get some <small>SNMP</small> program. First look if there
is a pre-compiled package available for your
<small>OS</small> . This is the preferred way. If not, you
will have to get the sources yourself and compile those. The
Internet is full of sources, programs etc. Find information
using a search engine or whatever you prefer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assume you got
the program. First try to collect some data that is
available on most systems. Remember: there is a short name
for the part of the tree that interests us most in the world
we live in!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I will give an
example which can be used on Fedora Core 3. If it
doesn&rsquo;t work for you, work your way through the manual
of snmp and adapt the example to make it work.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   snmpget &minus;v2c &minus;c public myrouter system.sysDescr.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The device
should answer with a description of itself, perhaps an empty
one. Until you got a valid answer from a device, perhaps
using a different &quot;password&quot;, or a different
device, there is no point in continuing.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   snmpget &minus;v2c &minus;c public myrouter interfaces.ifNumber.0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hopefully you
get a number as a result, the number of interfaces. If so,
you can carry on and try a different program called
&quot;snmpwalk&quot;.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   snmpwalk &minus;v2c &minus;c public myrouter interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it returns
with a list of interfaces, you&rsquo;re almost there.
Here&rsquo;s an example: <br>
[user@host /home/alex]$ snmpwalk &minus;v2c &minus;c public
cisco 2.2.1.2</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.1 = &quot;BRI0: B&minus;Channel 1&quot;
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.2 = &quot;BRI0: B&minus;Channel 2&quot;
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.3 = &quot;BRI0&quot; Hex: 42 52 49 30
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.4 = &quot;Ethernet0&quot;
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.5 = &quot;Loopback0&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On this cisco
equipment, I would like to monitor the &quot;Ethernet0&quot;
interface and from the above output I see that it is number
four. I try:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   [user@host /home/alex]$ snmpget &minus;v2c &minus;c public cisco 2.2.1.10.4 2.2.1.16.4
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifInOctets.4 = 2290729126
   interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifOutOctets.4 = 1256486519</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So now I have
two OIDs to monitor and they are (in full, this time):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">both with an
interface number of 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t get
fooled, this wasn&rsquo;t my first try. It took some time
for me too to understand what all these numbers mean. It
does help a lot when they get translated into descriptive
text... At least, when people are talking about MIBs and
OIDs you know what it&rsquo;s all about. Do not forget the
interface number (0 if it is not interface dependent) and
try snmpwalk if you don&rsquo;t get an answer from
snmpget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
understand the above section and get numbers from your
device, continue on with this tutorial. If not, then go back
and re-read this part.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A Real World
Example</b> <br>
Let the fun begin. First, create a new database. It contains
data from two counters, called input and output. The data is
put into archives that average it. They take 1, 6, 24 or 288
samples at a time. They also go into archives that keep the
maximum numbers. This will be explained later on. The time
in-between samples is 300 seconds, a good starting point,
which is the same as five minutes.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 sample &quot;averaged&quot; stays 1 period of 5 minutes
 6 samples averaged become one average on 30 minutes
 24 samples averaged become one average on 2 hours
 288 samples averaged become one average on 1 day</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lets try to be
compatible with <small>MRTG</small> which stores about the
following amount of data:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 600 5&minus;minute samples:    2   days and 2 hours
 600 30&minus;minute samples:  12.5 days
 600 2&minus;hour samples:     50   days
 732 1&minus;day samples:     732   days</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These ranges
are appended, so the total amount of data stored in the
database is approximately 797 days. RRDtool stores the data
differently, it doesn&rsquo;t start the &quot;weekly&quot;
archive where the &quot;daily&quot; archive stopped. For
both archives the most recent data will be near
&quot;now&quot; and therefore we will need to keep more data
than <small>MRTG</small> does!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We will
need:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 600 samples of 5 minutes  (2 days and 2 hours)
 700 samples of 30 minutes (2 days and 2 hours, plus 12.5 days)
 775 samples of 2 hours    (above + 50 days)
 797 samples of 1 day      (above + 732 days, rounded up to 797)
   rrdtool create myrouter.rrd         \
            DS:input:COUNTER:600:U:U   \
            DS:output:COUNTER:600:U:U  \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:600      \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:6:700      \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:24:775     \
            RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:797    \
            RRA:MAX:0.5:1:600          \
            RRA:MAX:0.5:6:700          \
            RRA:MAX:0.5:24:775         \
            RRA:MAX:0.5:288:797</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next thing to
do is to collect data and store it. Here is an example. It
is written partially in pseudo code, you will have to find
out what to do exactly on your <small>OS</small> to make it
work.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   while not the end of the universe

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, after

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This should
produce a picture with one day worth of traffic. One day is
24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds: 24*60*60=86400, we
start at now minus 86400 seconds. We define (with DEFs)
inoctets and outoctets as the average values from the
database myrouter.rrd and draw an area for the
&quot;in&quot; traffic and a line for the &quot;out&quot;
traffic.</p>

could try the examples from the test database and see if you
can get various options and calculations to work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Consolidation
Functions</b> <br>
A few paragraphs back I mentioned the possibility of keeping
the maximum values instead of the average values.
Let&rsquo;s go into this a bit more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Recall all the
stuff about the speed of the car. Suppose we drove at 144
km/h during 5 minutes and then were stopped by the police
for 25 minutes. At the end of the lecture we would take our
laptop and create and view the image taken from the
database. If we look at the second <small>RRA</small> we did
create, we would have the average from 6 samples. The
samples measured would be 144+0+0+0+0+0=144, divided by 30
minutes, corrected for the error by 1000, translated into
km/h, with a result of 24 km/h. I would still get a ticket
but not for speeding anymore :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously, in
this case we shouldn&rsquo;t look at the averages. In some
cases they are handy. If you want to know how many km you
had traveled, the averaged picture would be the right one to
look at. On the other hand, for the speed that we traveled
at, the maximum numbers seen is much more interesting. Later
we will see more types.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is the same
for data. If you want to know the amount, look at the
averages. If you want to know the rate, look at the maximum.
Over time, they will grow apart more and more. In the last
database we have created, there are two archives that keep
data per day. The archive that keeps averages will show low
numbers, the archive that shows maxima will have higher
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For my car this
would translate in averages per day of 96/24=4 km/h (as I
travel about 94 kilometers on a day) during working days,
and maxima of 120 km/h (my top speed that I reach every
day).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Big difference.
Do not look at the second graph to estimate the distances
that I travel and do not look at the first graph to estimate
my speed. This will work if the samples are close together,
as they are in five minutes, but not if you average.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some days, I
go for a long ride. If I go across Europe and travel for 12
hours, the first graph will rise to about 60 km/h. The
second one will show 180 km/h. This means that I traveled a
distance of 60 km/h times 24 h = 1440 km. I did this with a
higher speed and a maximum around 180 km/h. However, it
probably doesn&rsquo;t mean that I traveled for 8 hours at a
constant speed of 180 km/h!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a real
example: go with the flow through Germany (fast!) and stop a
few times for gas and coffee. Drive slowly through Austria
and the Netherlands. Be careful in the mountains and
villages. If you would look at the graphs created from the
five-minute averages you would get a totally different
picture. You would see the same values on the average and
maximum graphs (provided I measured every 300 seconds). You
would be able to see when I stopped, when I was in top gear,
when I drove over fast highways etc. The granularity of the
data is much higher, so you can see more. However, this
takes 12 samples per hour, or 288 values per day, so it
would be a lot of data over a longer period of time.
Therefore we average it, eventually to one value per day.
From this one value, we cannot see much detail, of
course.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Make sure you
understand the last few paragraphs. There is no value in
only a line and a few axis, you need to know what they mean
and interpret the data in an appropriate way. This is true
for all data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The biggest
mistake you can make is to use the collected data for
something that it is not suitable for. You would be better
off if you didn&rsquo;t have the graph at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Let&rsquo;s
review what you now should know</b> <br>
You know how to create a database and can put data in it.
You can get the numbers out again by creating an image, do
math on the data from the database and view the result
instead of the raw data. You know about the difference
between averages and maximum, and when to use which (or at
least you should have an idea).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RRDtool can do
more than what we have learned up to now. Before you
continue with the rest of this doc, I recommend that you
reread from the start and try some modifications on the
examples. Make sure you fully understand everything. It will
be worth the effort and helps you not only with the rest of
this tutorial, but also in your day to day monitoring long
after you read this introduction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Data Source
Types</b> <br>
All right, you feel like continuing. Welcome back and get
ready for an increased speed in the examples and
explanations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You know that
in order to view a counter over time, you have to take two
numbers and divide the difference of them between the time
lapsed. This makes sense for the examples I gave you but
there are other possibilities. For instance, I&rsquo;m able
to retrieve the temperature from my router in three places
namely the inlet, the so called hot-spot and the exhaust.
These values are not counters. If I take the difference of
the two samples and divide that by 300 seconds I would be
asking for the temperature change per second. Hopefully this
is zero! If not, the computer room is probably on fire
:)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, what can we
do? We can tell RRDtool to store the values we measure
directly as they are (this is not entirely true but close
enough). The graphs we make will look much better, they will
show a rather constant value. I know when the router is busy
(it works &minus;&gt; it uses more electricity &minus;&gt;
it generates more heat &minus;&gt; the temperature rises). I
know when the doors are left open (the room is air
conditioned) &minus;&gt; the warm air from the rest of the
building flows into the computer room &minus;&gt; the inlet
temperature rises). Etc. The data type we use when creating
the database before was counter, we now have a different
data type and thus a different name for it. It is called
<small>GAUGE</small> . There are more such data types:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &minus; COUNTER   we already know this one
 &minus; GAUGE     we just learned this one
 &minus; DERIVE
 &minus; ABSOLUTE</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
additional types are <small>DERIVE</small> and
<small>ABSOLUTE</small> . Absolute can be used like counter
with one difference: RRDtool assumes the counter is reset
when it&rsquo;s read. That is: its delta is known without
calculation by RRDtool whereas RRDtool needs to calculate it
for the counter type. Example: our first example (12345,
12357, 12363, 12363) would read: unknown, 12, 6, 0. The rest
of the calculations stay the same. The other one, derive, is
like counter. Unlike counter, it can also decrease so it can
have a negative delta. Again, the rest of the calculations
stay the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s try

the two gives increasing values.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Counter
Wraps</b> <br>
There are a few more basics to show. Some important options
are still to be covered and we haven&rsquo;t look at counter
wraps yet. First the counter wrap: In our car we notice that
the counter shows 999987. We travel 20 km and the counter
should go to 1000007. Unfortunately, there are only six
digits on our counter so it really shows 000007. If we would
plot that on a type <small>DERIVE</small> , it would mean
that the counter was set back 999980 km. It wasn&rsquo;t,
and there has to be some protection for this. This
protection is only available for type <small>COUNTER</small>
which should be used for this kind of counter anyways. How
does it work? Type counter should never decrease and
therefore RRDtool must assume it wrapped if it does
decrease! If the delta is negative, this can be compensated
for by adding the maximum value of the counter + 1. For our
car this would be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> Delta = 7 &minus; 999987 = &minus;999980    (instead of 1000007&minus;999987=20)
 Real delta = &minus;999980 + 999999 + 1 = 20</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the time of
writing this document, RRDtool knows of counters that are
either 32 bits or 64 bits of size. These counters can handle
the following different values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &minus; 32 bits: 0 ..           4294967295
 &minus; 64 bits: 0 .. 18446744073709551615</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If these
numbers look strange to you, you can view them in their
hexadecimal form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &minus; 32 bits: 0 ..         FFFFFFFF
 &minus; 64 bits: 0 .. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RRDtool handles
both counters the same. If an overflow occurs and the delta
would be negative, RRDtool first adds the maximum of a small
counter + 1 to the delta. If the delta is still negative, it
had to be the large counter that wrapped. Add the maximum
possible value of the large counter + 1 and subtract the
erroneously added small value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a risk
in this: suppose the large counter wrapped while adding a
huge delta, it could happen, theoretically, that adding the
smaller value would make the delta positive. In this
unlikely case the results would not be correct. The increase
should be nearly as high as the maximum counter value for
that to happen, so chances are you would have several other
problems as well and this particular problem would not even
be worth thinking about. Even though, I did include an
example, so you can judge for yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next
section gives you some numerical examples for counter-wraps.
Try to do the calculations yourself or just believe me if
your calculator can&rsquo;t handle the numbers :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see
from the last two examples, you need strange numbers for
RRDtool to fail (provided it&rsquo;s bug free of course), so
this should not happen. However, <small>SNMP</small> or
whatever method you choose to collect the data, might also
report wrong numbers occasionally. We can&rsquo;t prevent
all errors, but there are some things we can do. The RRDtool
&quot;create&quot; command takes two special parameters for
this. They define the minimum and maximum allowed values.
Until now, we used &quot;U&quot;, meaning
&quot;unknown&quot;. If you provide values for one or both
of them and if RRDtool receives data points that are outside
these limits, it will ignore those values. For a thermometer
in degrees Celsius, the absolute minimum is just under
&minus;273. For my router, I can assume this minimum is much
higher so I would set it to 10, where as the maximum
temperature I would set to 80. Any higher and the device
would be out of order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the speed
of my car, I would never expect negative numbers and also I
would not expect a speed higher than 230. Anything else, and
there must have been an error. Remember: the opposite is not
true, if the numbers pass this check, it doesn&rsquo;t mean
that they are correct. Always judge the graph with a healthy
dose of suspicion if it seems weird to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Data
Resampling</b> <br>
One important feature of RRDtool has not been explained yet:
it is virtually impossible to collect data and feed it into
RRDtool on exact intervals. RRDtool therefore interpolates
the data, so they are stored on exact intervals. If you do
not know what this means or how it works, then here&rsquo;s
the help you seek:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose a
counter increases by exactly one for every second. You want
to measure it in 300 seconds intervals. You should retrieve
values that are exactly 300 apart. However, due to various
circumstances you are a few seconds late and the interval is
303. The delta will also be 303 in that case. Obviously,
RRDtool should not put 303 in the database and make you
believe that the counter increased by 303 in 300 seconds.
This is where RRDtool interpolates: it alters the 303 value
as if it would have been stored earlier and it will be 300
in 300 seconds. Next time you are at exactly the right time.
This means that the current interval is 297 seconds and also
the counter increased by 297. Again, RRDtool interpolates
and stores 300 as it should be.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">      in the RRD                 in reality

create two identical databases. I&rsquo;ve chosen the time
range 920805000 to 920805900 as this goes very well with the
example numbers.</p>

images together (add them to your index.html file) and
compare. Both graphs should show the same, despite the input
being different.</p>

<h2>WRAPUP
<a name="WRAPUP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s time
now to wrap up this tutorial. We covered all the basics for
you to be able to work with RRDtool and to read the
additional documentation available. There is plenty more to
discover about RRDtool and you will find more and more uses
for this package. You can easily create graphs using just
the examples provided and using only RRDtool. You can also
use one of the front ends to RRDtool that are available.</p>

<h2>MAILINGLIST
<a name="MAILINGLIST"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to
subscribe to the RRDtool mailing list. Even if you are not
answering to mails that come by, it helps both you and the
rest of the users. A lot of the stuff that I know about
<small>MRTG</small> (and therefore about RRDtool) I&rsquo;ve
learned while just reading the list without posting to it. I
did not need to ask the basic questions as they are answered
in the <small>FAQ</small> (read it!) and in various mails by
other users. With thousands of users all over the world,
there will always be people who ask questions that you can
answer because you read this and other documentation and
they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I hope you
enjoyed the examples and their descriptions. If you do, help
other people by pointing them to this document when they are
asking basic questions. They will not only get their
answers, but at the same time learn a whole lot more.</p>
