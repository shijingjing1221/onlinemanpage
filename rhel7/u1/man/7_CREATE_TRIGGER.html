<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
TRIGGER</b> creates a new trigger. The trigger will be
associated with the specified table or view and will execute
the specified function <i>function_name</i> when certain
events occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The trigger can
be specified to fire before the operation is attempted on a
row (before constraints are checked and the <b>INSERT</b>,
<b>UPDATE</b>, or <b>DELETE</b> is attempted); or after the
operation has completed (after constraints are checked and
the <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, or <b>DELETE</b> has
completed); or instead of the operation (in the case of
inserts, updates or deletes on a view). If the trigger fires
before or instead of the event, the trigger can skip the
operation for the current row, or change the row being
inserted (for <b>INSERT</b> and <b>UPDATE</b> operations
only). If the trigger fires after the event, all changes,
including the effects of other triggers, are
&ldquo;visible&rdquo; to the trigger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A trigger that
is marked FOR EACH ROW is called once for every row that the
operation modifies. For example, a <b>DELETE</b> that
affects 10 rows will cause any ON DELETE triggers on the
target relation to be called 10 separate times, once for
each deleted row. In contrast, a trigger that is marked FOR
EACH STATEMENT only executes once for any given operation,
regardless of how many rows it modifies (in particular, an
operation that modifies zero rows will still result in the
execution of any applicable FOR EACH STATEMENT
triggers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Triggers that
are specified to fire INSTEAD OF the trigger event must be
marked FOR EACH ROW, and can only be defined on views.
BEFORE and AFTER triggers on a view must be marked as FOR
EACH STATEMENT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
triggers may be defined to fire for <b>TRUNCATE</b>, though
only FOR EACH STATEMENT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
table summarizes which types of triggers may be used on
tables and views:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-285551.png" alt="Image grohtml-285551.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Also, a trigger definition can
specify a Boolean WHEN condition, which will be tested to
see whether the trigger should be fired. In row&minus;level
triggers the WHEN condition can examine the old and/or new
values of columns of the row. Statement&minus;level triggers
can also have WHEN conditions, although the feature is not
so useful for them since the condition cannot refer to any
values in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If multiple
triggers of the same kind are defined for the same event,
they will be fired in alphabetical order by name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
CONSTRAINT option is specified, this command creates a
constraint trigger. This is the same as a regular trigger
except that the timing of the trigger firing can be adjusted
using SET CONSTRAINTS (<b>SET_CONSTRAINTS</b>(7)).
Constraint triggers must be AFTER ROW triggers. They can be
fired either at the end of the statement causing the
triggering event, or at the end of the containing
transaction; in the latter case they are said to be
deferred. A pending deferred&minus;trigger firing can also
be forced to happen immediately by using <b>SET
CONSTRAINTS</b>. Constraint triggers are expected to raise
an exception when the constraints they implement are
violated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SELECT</b>
does not modify any rows so you cannot create <b>SELECT</b>
triggers. Rules and views are more appropriate in such
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Refer to
Chapter 36, Triggers, in the documentation for more
information about triggers.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name to give the new
trigger. This must be distinct from the name of any other
trigger for the same table. The name cannot be
schema&minus;qualified &mdash; the trigger inherits the
schema of its table. For a constraint trigger, this is also
the name to use when modifying the trigger's behavior using
<b>SET CONSTRAINTS</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEFORE, AFTER,
INSTEAD OF</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Determines whether the function
is called before, after, or instead of the event. A
constraint trigger can only be specified as AFTER.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>event</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
or TRUNCATE; this specifies the event that will fire the
trigger. Multiple events can be specified using OR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For UPDATE
events, it is possible to specify a list of columns using
this syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">UPDATE OF
<i>column_name1</i> [, <i>column_name2</i> ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The trigger
will only fire if at least one of the listed columns is
mentioned as a target of the <b>UPDATE</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">INSTEAD OF
UPDATE events do not support lists of columns.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name (optionally
schema&minus;qualified) of the table or view the trigger is
for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>referenced_table_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The (possibly
schema&minus;qualified) name of another table referenced by
the constraint. This option is used for foreign&minus;key
constraints and is not recommended for general use. This can
only be specified for constraint triggers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DEFERRABLE, NOT
DEFERRABLE, INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, INITIALLY DEFERRED</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default timing of the
trigger. See the CREATE TABLE (<b>CREATE_TABLE</b>(7))
documentation for details of these constraint options. This
can only be specified for constraint triggers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FOR EACH ROW,
FOR EACH STATEMENT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This specifies whether the
trigger procedure should be fired once for every row
affected by the trigger event, or just once per SQL
statement. If neither is specified, FOR EACH STATEMENT is
the default. Constraint triggers can only be specified FOR
EACH ROW.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>condition</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Boolean expression that
determines whether the trigger function will actually be
executed. If WHEN is specified, the function will only be
called if the <i>condition</i> returns true. In FOR EACH ROW
triggers, the WHEN condition can refer to columns of the old
and/or new row values by writing OLD.<i>column_name</i> or
NEW.<i>column_name</i> respectively. Of course, INSERT
triggers cannot refer to OLD and DELETE triggers cannot
refer to NEW.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">INSTEAD OF
triggers do not support WHEN conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, WHEN
expressions cannot contain subqueries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
constraint triggers, evaluation of the WHEN condition is not
deferred, but occurs immediately after the row update
operation is performed. If the condition does not evaluate
to true then the trigger is not queued for deferred
execution.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>function_name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A user&minus;supplied function
that is declared as taking no arguments and returning type
trigger, which is executed when the trigger fires.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>arguments</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An optional
comma&minus;separated list of arguments to be provided to
the function when the trigger is executed. The arguments are
literal string constants. Simple names and numeric constants
can be written here, too, but they will all be converted to
strings. Please check the description of the implementation
language of the trigger function to find out how these
arguments can be accessed within the function; it might be
different from normal function arguments.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create a
trigger on a table, the user must have the TRIGGER privilege
on the table. The user must also have EXECUTE privilege on
the trigger function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use DROP
TRIGGER (<b>DROP_TRIGGER</b>(7)) to remove a trigger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
column&minus;specific trigger (one defined using the UPDATE
OF <i>column_name</i> syntax) will fire when any of its
columns are listed as targets in the <b>UPDATE</b> command's
SET list. It is possible for a column's value to change even
when the trigger is not fired, because changes made to the
row's contents by BEFORE UPDATE triggers are not considered.
Conversely, a command such as UPDATE ... SET x = x ... will
fire a trigger on column x, even though the column's value
did not change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a BEFORE
trigger, the WHEN condition is evaluated just before the
function is or would be executed, so using WHEN is not
materially different from testing the same condition at the
beginning of the trigger function. Note in particular that
the NEW row seen by the condition is the current value, as
possibly modified by earlier triggers. Also, a BEFORE
trigger's WHEN condition is not allowed to examine the
system columns of the NEW row (such as oid), because those
won't have been set yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In an AFTER
trigger, the WHEN condition is evaluated just after the row
update occurs, and it determines whether an event is queued
to fire the trigger at the end of statement. So when an
AFTER trigger's WHEN condition does not return true, it is
not necessary to queue an event nor to re&minus;fetch the
row at end of statement. This can result in significant
speedups in statements that modify many rows, if the trigger
only needs to be fired for a few of the rows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In PostgreSQL
versions before 7.3, it was necessary to declare trigger
functions as returning the placeholder type opaque, rather
than trigger. To support loading of old dump files,
<b>CREATE TRIGGER</b> will accept a function declared as
returning opaque, but it will issue a notice and change the
function's declared return type to trigger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Execute the
function <b>check_account_update</b> whenever a row of the

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>CREATE
TRIGGER</b> statement in PostgreSQL implements a subset of
the SQL standard. The following functionality is currently
missing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; SQL
allows you to define aliases for the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and
&ldquo;new&rdquo; rows or tables for use in the definition
of the triggered action (e.g., CREATE TRIGGER ... ON
tablename REFERENCING OLD ROW AS somename NEW ROW AS
othername ...). Since PostgreSQL allows trigger procedures
to be written in any number of user&minus;defined languages,
access to the data is handled in a language&minus;specific
way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
PostgreSQL only allows the execution of a user&minus;defined
function for the triggered action. The standard allows the
execution of a number of other SQL commands, such as
<b>CREATE TABLE</b>, as the triggered action. This
limitation is not hard to work around by creating a
user&minus;defined function that executes the desired
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SQL specifies
that multiple triggers should be fired in
time&minus;of&minus;creation order. PostgreSQL uses name
order, which was judged to be more convenient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SQL specifies
that BEFORE DELETE triggers on cascaded deletes fire
<i>after</i> the cascaded DELETE completes. The PostgreSQL
behavior is for BEFORE DELETE to always fire before the
delete action, even a cascading one. This is considered more
consistent. There is also nonstandard behavior if BEFORE
triggers modify rows or prevent updates during an update
that is caused by a referential action. This can lead to
constraint violations or stored data that does not honor the
referential constraint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ability to
specify multiple actions for a single trigger using OR is a
PostgreSQL extension of the SQL standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ability to
fire triggers for <b>TRUNCATE</b> is a PostgreSQL extension
of the SQL standard, as is the ability to define
statement&minus;level triggers on views.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CREATE
CONSTRAINT TRIGGER</b> is a PostgreSQL extension of the SQL
standard.</p>
