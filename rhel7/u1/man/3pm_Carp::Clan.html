<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module is
based on &quot;<tt>&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</tt>&quot; from Perl
5.005_03. It has been modified to skip all package names
matching the pattern given in the &quot;use&quot; statement
inside the &quot;<tt>&quot;qw()&quot;</tt>&quot; term (or
argument list).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
have a family of modules or classes named
&quot;Pack::A&quot;, &quot;Pack::B&quot; and so on, and each
of them uses &quot;<tt>&quot;Carp::Clan
qw(^Pack::);&quot;</tt>&quot; (or at least the one in which
the error or warning gets raised).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus when for
example your script &quot;tool.pl&quot; calls module
&quot;Pack::A&quot;, and module &quot;Pack::A&quot; calls
module &quot;Pack::B&quot;, an exception raised in module
&quot;Pack::B&quot; will appear to have originated in
&quot;tool.pl&quot; where &quot;Pack::A&quot; was called,
and not in &quot;Pack::A&quot; where &quot;Pack::B&quot; was
called, as the unmodified
&quot;<tt>&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</tt>&quot; would try to make
you believe <tt>&quot;:&minus;)&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This works
similarly if &quot;Pack::B&quot; calls &quot;Pack::C&quot;
where the exception is raised, etcetera.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
this blames all errors in the
&quot;<tt>&quot;Pack::*&quot;</tt>&quot; modules on the user
of these modules, i.e., on you.
<tt>&quot;;&minus;)&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The skipping of
a clan (or family) of packages according to a pattern
describing its members is necessary in cases where these
modules are not classes derived from each other (and thus
when examining <tt>@ISA</tt> &minus; as in the original
&quot;<tt>&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</tt>&quot; module &minus;
doesn&rsquo;t help).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose and
advantage of this is that a &quot;clan&quot; of modules can
work together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at
various depths down the calling hierarchy and still appear
as a monolithic block (as though they were a single module)
from the perspective of the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case you
just want to ward off all error messages from the module in
which you &quot;<tt>&quot;use Carp::Clan&quot;</tt>&quot;,
i.e., if you want to make all error messages or warnings to
appear to originate from where your module was called (this
is what you usually used to &quot;<tt>&quot;use
Carp;&quot;</tt>&quot; for <tt>&quot;;&minus;)&quot;</tt>),
instead of in your module itself (which is what you can do
with a &quot;die&quot; or &quot;warn&quot; anyway), you do
not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically
provide the correct one for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I.e., just
&quot;<tt>&quot;use Carp::Clan;&quot;</tt>&quot; without any
arguments and call &quot;carp&quot; or &quot;croak&quot; as
appropriate, and they will automatically defend your module
against all blames!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
a pattern is only necessary if you want to make several
modules (more than one) work together and appear as though
they were only one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Forcing a
Stack Trace</b> <br>
As a debugging aid, you can force
&quot;<tt>&quot;Carp::Clan&quot;</tt>&quot; to treat a
&quot;croak&quot; as a &quot;confess&quot; and a
&quot;carp&quot; as a &quot;cluck&quot;. In other words,
force a detailed stack trace to be given. This can be very
helpful when trying to understand why, or from where, a
warning or error is being generated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
enabled either by &quot;importing&quot; the non-existent
symbol &rsquo;verbose&rsquo;, or by setting the global
variable &quot;<tt>$Carp::Clan::Verbose</tt>&quot; to a true
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You would
typically enable it by saying</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Carp::Clan qw(verbose);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can both specify a &quot;family pattern&quot; and the string
&quot;verbose&quot; inside the
&quot;<tt>&quot;qw()&quot;</tt>&quot; term (or argument
list) of the &quot;use&quot; statement, but consider that a
pattern of packages to skip is pointless when
&quot;verbose&quot; causes a full stack trace anyway.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;<tt>&quot;Carp::Clan&quot;</tt>&quot; routines
don&rsquo;t handle exception objects currently. If called
with a first argument that is a reference, they simply call
&quot;<tt>&quot;die()&quot;</tt>&quot; or
&quot;<tt>&quot;warn()&quot;</tt>&quot;, as appropriate.</p>
