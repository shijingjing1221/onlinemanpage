<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TPM Quote Tools
is a collection of programs that provide support for TPM
based attestation using the TPM quote operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A TPM contains
a set of Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). In a well
configured machine, some of these registers are set to known
values during the boot up process or at other times. For
example, a PCR might contain the hash of a boot loader in
memory before it is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TPM quote
operation is used to authoritatively verify the contents of
a TPM&rsquo;s Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).
During provisioning, a composite hash of a selected set of
PCRs is computed. The TPM quote operation produces a
composite hash that can be compared with the one computed
while provisioning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use the TPM
quote operation, keys must be generated. During
provisioning, an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is generated
for each TPM, and the public part of the key is made
available to entities that validate quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TPM quote
operation returns signed data and a signature. The data that
is signed contains the PCRs selected for the operation, the
composite hash for the selected PCRs, and a nonce provided
as input, and used to prevent replay attacks. At
provisioning time, the data that is signed is stored, not
just the composite hash. The signature is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An entity that
wishes to evaluate a machine generates a nonce, and sends it
along with the set of PCR used to generate the composite PCR
hash at provisioning time. For this use of the TPM quote
operation, the signed data is ignored, and the signature
returned is used to validate the state of the TPM&rsquo;s
PCRs. Given the signature, the evaluating entity replaces
the nonce in the signed data generated at provisioning time,
and checks to see if the signature is valid for the data. If
so, this check ensures the selected PCRs contain values that
match the ones measured during provisioning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
scenario for an enterprise using these tools follows. The
tools expect AIKs to be referenced via one enterprise-wide
Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). The program
<b>tpm_mkuuid</b> creates one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each
machine being checked, an AIK is created using
<b>tpm_mkaik.</b> The key blob produced is bound to the UUID
on its machine using <b>tpm_loadkey.</b> The public key
associated with the AIK is sent to the entities that verify
quotes. Finally, the expected PCR composite hash is obtained
using <b>tpm_getpcrhash.</b> When the expected PCR values
change, a new hash can be generated with
<b>tpm_updatepcrhash.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program to
obtain a quote, and thus measure the current state of the
PCRs is <b>tpm_getquote.</b> The program that verifies the
quote describes the same PCR composite hash as was measured
initially is <b>tpm_verifyquote.</b></p>
