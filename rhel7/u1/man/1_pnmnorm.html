<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmnorm</b>
reads a PNM image (PBM, PGM, or PPM). It normalizes the
contrast by forcing the brightest pixels to white, the
darkest pixels to black, and spreading out the ones in
between. It produces the same kind of file as output. This
is pretty useless for a PBM image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
offers two ways of spreading out the pixels in between the
darkest and brightest: linear and quadratic. In the
quadratic case, you specify some in between brightness and
specify what brightness that should become in the output.
With those three constraints: the brightness that becomes
black, the brightness that becomes white, and the brightness
that becomes that middle value, <b>pnmnorm</b> computes a
quadratic equation that maps all the other brightnesses from
input values to output values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
first determines a mapping of old brightness to new
brightness. For each possible brightness of a pixel, the
program determines a corresponding brightness for the output
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then for each
pixel in the image, the program computes a color which has
the desired output brightness and puts that in the output.
With a color image, it is not always possible to compute
such a color and retain any semblance of the original hue,
so the brightest and dimmest pixels may only approximate the
desired brightness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a PPM
image, you have a choice of three ways to define
brightness:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="16%">

<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="16%">


<p>saturation</p></td>
<td width="62%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the case of
saturation, &rsquo;brightness&rsquo; is pretty much a
misnomer, but you can use the brightness analogy to see what
it does. In the analogy, bright means saturated and dark
means unsaturated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all
of these are different from separately normalizing the
individual color components.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
way to spread out the brightnesses in an image is
<b>pnmhisteq</b>. <b>pnmhisteq</b> stretches the brightest
pixels to white and the darkest pixels to black, but rather
than linearly adjusting the ones in between, it adjusts them
so that there are an equal number of pixels of each
brightness throughout the range. This gives you more
contrast than <b>pnmnorm</b> does, but can considerably
change the picture in exchange.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
darkest 2 percent of all pixels are mapped to black, and the
brightest 1 percent are mapped to white. You can override
these percentages by using the <b>-bpercent</b> and
<b>-wpercent</b> options, or you can specify the exact pixel
values to be mapped by using the <b>-bvalue</b> and
<b>-wvalue</b> options. You can get appropriate numbers for
the options from <b>ppmhist</b>. If you just want to enhance
the contrast, then choose values at elbows in the histogram;
e.g. if value 29 represents 3% of the image but value 30
represents 20%, choose 30 for <i>bvalue</i>. If you want to
brighten the image, then set <i>bvalue</i> to 0 and just
fiddle with <i>wvalue</i>; similarly, to darken the image,
set <i>wvalue</i> to maxval and play with <i>bvalue</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
both <b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b>
uses the one that produces the least change. The same goes
for <b>-wvalue</b> and <b>-wpercent</b>. (In Netpbm 10.26
(January 2005), the <b>-bvalue</b>/<b>-wvalue</b> takes
precedence, and before that, it&rsquo;s a syntax error to
specify both).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
maximize the change instead of minimizing it, just cascade
two runs of <b>pnmnorm</b>, specifying values for the first
and percentages for the second.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-bpercent</b>
and <b>-wpercent</b> values are floating point decimal. Zero
is valid and is the same as <b>-bvalue=0</b> or
<b>-wvalue=</b><i>maxval</i>, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because there
are whole numbers of pixels at each brightness,
<b>pnmnorm</b> obviously can&rsquo;t guarantee the exact
percentage, so it arranges that <i>at least</i> the
percentage of pixels you specify get remapped as
promised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
for your <b>-bpercent</b> or <b>-wpercent</b> to overlap
your <b>-wvalue</b> or <b>-bvalue</b>, respectively. For
example, you say <b>-bpercent=20</b> and <b>-wvalue=100</b>
for an image in which only 10 percent of the pixels are
darker than 100. In that case, <b>pnmnorm</b> adjusts the
percentile value as required. In the example, it uses 99 as
the black value (like <b>-bvalue=99</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible for your <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b>
options to select the same brightness value for the
stretch-to-white and stretch-to-black value because of the
fact that <b>pnmnorm</b> can&rsquo;t subdivide a histogram
cell. E.g. if an image is all brightness 100, then no matter
what <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> values you
choose, it&rsquo;s the same as saying <b>-bvalue=100
-wvalue=100</b>. In that case, <b>pnmnorm</b> changes one of
the values by 1 to make it legal. In the example,
<b>pnmnorm</b> would either make the black value 99 or the
white value 101.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.43 (June 2008), <b>pnmnorm</b> fails if the
<b>-wpercent</b> and/or <b>-bpercent</b> values specify an
overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The stretch
points are further constrained by the <b>-maxexpand</b>
option. Sometimes, too much contrast is a bad thing. If your
intensities are all concentrated in the middle,
<b>-bpercent=2</b> and <b>-wpercent=1</b> might mean that an
intensity of 60 gets stretched up to 100 and intensity of 20
gets stretched down to zero, for a range expansion of 150%
(from a range of 40 to a range of 100). That much stretching
means two adjacent pixels that used to differ in intensity
by 4 units now differ by 10, and that might be
unsightly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So that you can
put a limit on the amount of expansion without having to
examine the image first, there is the <b>-maxexpand</b>
option. It specifies the maximum expansion you will
tolerate, as an additional percentage. In the example above,
you could say <b>-maxexpand=50</b> to say you want the range
to expand by at most 50%, regardless of your other options.
<b>pnmnorm</b> figures out what intensity to stretch to full
intensity and what intensity to stretch to zero intensity as
described above, and then raises the former and lowers the
latter as needed to limit the expansion to the amount you
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>pnmnorm</b> limits the expansion due to
<b>-maxexpand</b>, it tells you about it with a message like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%;">    limiting expansion of 150% to 50%</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In any case,
<b>pnmnorm</b> tells you exactly what expansion it&rsquo;s
doing, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    remapping 25..75 to 0..100</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.26 (December 2004), it was not valid to specify both
<b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b> or <b>-wvalue</b> and
<b>-wpercent</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-maxexpand</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-keephues</b> option says to keep each pixel the same hue
as it is in the input; just adjust its brightness. You
normally want this; the only reason it is not the default
behavior is backward compatibility with a design
mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>pnmnorm</b> normalizes contrast in each component
independently (except that the meaning of the
<b>-wpercent</b> and <b>-bpercent</b> options are based on
the overall brightnesses of the colors, not each component
taken separately). So if you have a color which is intensely
red but dimly green, <b>pnmnorm</b> would make the red more
intense and the green less intense, so you end up with a
different hue than you started with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
specify <b>-midvalue=</b><i>N</i>, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses a
quadratic function to map old brightnesses to new ones,
making sure that an old brightness of <i>N</i> becomes 50%
bright in the output. You can override that 50% default with
<b>-middle</b>. The value of <b>-middle</b> is a floating
point number in the range 0 through 1 with 0 being full
darkness and 1 full brightness. If your <b>-midvalue</b> and
<b>-middle</b> indicate an ambiguous or impossible quadratic
function (e.g. <b>-midvalue</b> is the same as
<b>-bvalue</b>, so an infinite number of quadratic functions
fit), <b>pnmnorm</b> just ignores your <b>-midvalue</b> and
maps linearly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-midvalue</b>
and <b>-middle</b> were new in Netpbm 10.57 (December
2011).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
<b>-keephues</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b> would likely leave this
pixel alone, since its overall brightness is medium.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-keephues</b>
can cause clipping, because a certain color may be below a
target intensity while one of its components is saturated.
Where that&rsquo;s the case, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses the maximum
representable intensity for the saturated component and the
pixel ends up with less overall intensity, and a different
hue, than it is supposed to have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
meaningless on grayscale images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> specify <b>-keephues</b>, the
<b>-luminosity</b>, <b>-colorvalue</b>, and
<b>-saturation</b> options affect the transfer function
(which is the same for all three RGB components), but are
meaningless when it comes to applying the transfer function
(since it is applied to each individual RGB component).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
9.25 (March 2002), there was no <b>-keephues</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-luminosity</b>,
<b>-colorvalue</b>, and <b>-saturation</b> determine what
property of the pixels <b>pnmnorm</b> normalizes. I.e., what
kind of brightness. You cannot specify more than one of
these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-luminosity</b> option says to use the luminosity (i.e.
the &rsquo;Y&rsquo; in the YUV or YCbCr color space) as the
pixel&rsquo;s brightness. The luminosity is a measure of how
bright a human eye would find the color, taking into account
the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to some RGB
components than others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
meaningless on grayscale images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-luminosity</b> option,
but its meaning was still the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-colorvalue</b> option says to use the color value (i.e.
the &rsquo;V&rsquo; in the HSV color space) as the
pixel&rsquo;s brightness. The color value is the
gamma-adjusted intensity of the most intense RGB
component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
meaningless on grayscale images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-saturation</b> option says to use the saturation (i.e.
the &rsquo;S&rsquo; in the HSV color space) as the
pixel&rsquo;s brightness. The saturation is the ratio of the
intensity of the most intense RGB component to the
difference between the intensities of the most and least
intense RGB component (all intensities gamma-adjusted).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
&rsquo;brightness&rsquo; is more of a metaphor than
anything. &rsquo;bright&rsquo; means saturated and
&rsquo;dark&rsquo; means unsaturated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
meaningless on grayscale images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b>
option.</p>
