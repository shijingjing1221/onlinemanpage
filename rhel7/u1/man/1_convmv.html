normalization form C for <small>UTF&minus;8</small> (Linux
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;nfd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">target files will be
normalization form D for <small>UTF&minus;8</small> (
<small>OS X</small> etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;qfrom</b> ,
<b>&minus;&minus;qto</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">be more quiet about the
&quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot; of a rename (if it screws
up your terminal e.g.). This will in fact do nothing else
than replace any non-ASCII character (bytewise) with ? and
any control character with * on printout, this does not
affect rename operation itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;exec</b>
command</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">execute the given command. You
have to quote the command and #1 will be substituted by the
old, #2 by the new filename. Using this option link targets
will stay untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">convmv &minus;f
latin1 &minus;t utf&minus;8 &minus;r &minus;&minus;exec
&quot;echo #1 should be renamed to #2&quot;
path/to/files</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;list</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">list all available encodings.
To get support for more Chinese or Japanese encodings
install the Perl HanExtra or <small>JIS2K</small> Encode
packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;lowmem</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">keep memory footprint low by
not creating a hash of all files. This disables checking if
symlink targets are in subtree. Symlink target pointers will
be converted regardlessly. If you convert multiple
hundredthousands or millions of files the memory usage of
convmv might grow quite high. This option would help you out
in that case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;nosmart</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">by default convmv will detect
if a filename is already <small>UTF8</small> encoded and
will skip this file if conversion from some charset to
<small>UTF8</small> should be performed.
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;nosmart&quot;</tt> will also force
conversion to <small>UTF&minus;8</small> for such files,
which might result in &quot;double encoded
<small>UTF&minus;8&quot;</small> (see section below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fixdouble</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">using the
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;fixdouble&quot;</tt> option convmv
does only convert files which will still be
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded after conversion.
That&rsquo;s useful for fixing double-encoded
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> files. All files which are not
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> or will not result in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> after conversion will not be
touched. Also see chapter &quot;How to undo double
<small>UTF&minus;8 ...&quot;</small> below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;notest</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Needed to actually rename the
files. By default convmv will just print what it wants to
do.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;parsable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an advanced option that
people who want to write a <small>GUI</small> front end will
find useful (some others maybe, too). It will convmv make
print out what it would do in an easy parsable way. The
first column contains the action or some kind of
information, the second column mostly contains the file that
is to be modified and if appropriate the third column
contains the modified value. Each column is separated by
\0\n (nullbyte newline). Each row (one action) is separated
by \0\0\n (nullbyte nullbyte newline).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;preserve&minus;mtimes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">modifying filenames usually
causes the parent directory&rsquo;s mtime being updated.
This option allows to reset the mtime to the old value. If
your filesystem supports sub-second resolution the
sub-second part of the atime and mtime will be lost as Perl
does not yet support that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;replace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">if the file to which shall be
renamed already exists, it will be overwritten if the other
file content is equal.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;unescape</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this option will remove this
ugly % hex sequences from filenames and turn them into
(hopefully) nicer 8&minus;bit characters. After
&minus;&minus;unescape you might want to do a charset
conversion. This sequences like <tt>%20</tt> etc. are
sometimes produced when downloading via http or ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;upper</b> ,
<b>&minus;&minus;lower</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">turn filenames into all upper
or all lower case. When the file is not ASCII-encoded,
convmv expects a charset to be entered via the &minus;f
switch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dotlessi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">care about the dotless i/I
issue. A lowercase version of &quot;I&quot; will also be
dotless while an uppercase version of &quot;i&quot; will
also be dotted. This is an issue for Turkish and Azeri.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By the way: The
superscript dot of the letter i was added in the Middle Ages
to distinguish the letter (in manuscripts) from adjacent
vertical strokes in such letters as u, m, and n. J is a
variant form of i which emerged at this time and
subsequently became a separate letter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">print a short summary of
available options</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>convmv</b>
is meant to help convert a single filename, a directory tree
and the contained files or a whole filesystem into a
different encoding. It just converts the filenames, not the
content of the files. A special feature of convmv is that it
also takes care of symlinks, also converts the symlink
target pointer in case the symlink target is being
converted, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All this comes
in very handy when one wants to switch over from old
8&minus;bit locales to <small>UTF&minus;8</small> locales.
It is also possible to convert directories to
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> which are already partly
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded. convmv is able to detect
if certain files are <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded and
will skip them by default. To turn this smartness off use
the <tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;nosmart&quot;</tt> switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filesystem
issues</b> <br>
Almost all <small>POSIX</small> filesystems do not care
about how filenames are encoded, here are some
exceptions:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>HFS+</small>
on <small>OS X /</small> Darwin</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux and
(most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the so called
normalization form C ( <small>NFC</small> ) for its
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding by default but do not
enforce this. Darwin, the base of the Macintosh
<small>OS</small> enforces normalization form D (
<small>NFD</small> ), where a few characters are encoded in
a different way. On <small>OS X</small> it&rsquo;s not
possible to create <small>NFC UTF&minus;8</small> filenames
because this is prevented at filesystem layer. On
<small>HFS+</small> filenames are internally stored in
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> and when converted back to
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> for the underlying
<small>BSD</small> system to be handable, <small>NFD</small>
is created. See
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for
defails. I think it was a very bad idea and breaks many
things under <small>OS X</small> which expect a normal
<small>POSIX</small> conforming system. Anywhere else convmv
is able to convert files from <small>NFC</small> to
<small>NFD</small> or vice versa which makes
interoperability with such systems a lot easier.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>JFS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If people mount
<small>JFS</small> partitions with iocharset=utf8, there is
a similar problem, because <small>JFS</small> is designed to
store filenames internally in <small>UTF&minus;16,</small>
too; that is because Linux&rsquo; <small>JFS</small> is
really <small>JFS2,</small> which was a rewrite of
<small>JFS</small> for <small>OS/2. JFS</small> partitions
should always be mounted with iocharset=iso8859&minus;1,
which is also the default with recent 2.6.6 kernels. If this
is not done, <small>JFS</small> does not behave like a
<small>POSIX</small> filesystem and it might happen that
certain files cannot be created at all, for example
filenames in <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1</small> encoding.
Only when interoperation with <small>OS/2</small> is needed
iocharset should be set according to your used locale
charmap.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>NFS4</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Despite other
<small>POSIX</small> filesystems <small>RFC3530</small> (
<small>NFS 4</small> ) mandates <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
but also says: &quot;The nfs4_cs_prep profile does not
specify a normalization form. A later revision of this
specification may specify a particular normalization
form.&quot; In other words, if you want to use
<small>NFS4</small> you might find the conversion and
normalization features of convmv quite useful.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>FAT/VFAT</small>
and <small>NTFS</small></i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NTFS</small>
and <small>VFAT</small> (for long filenames) use
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> internally to store filenames.
You should not need to convert filenames if you mount one of
those filesystems. Use appropriate mount options
instead!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How to undo
double <small>UTF&minus;8</small> (or other) encoded
filenames</b> <br>
Sometimes it might happen that you
&quot;double-encoded&quot; certain filenames, for example
the file names already were <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
encoded and you accidently did another conversion from some
charset to <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> You can simply undo
that by converting that the other way round. The
from-charset has to be <small>UTF&minus;8</small> and the
to-charset has to be the from-charset you previously
accidently used. If you use the
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;fixdouble&quot;</tt> option convmv
will make sure that only files will be processed that will
still be <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded after conversion
and it will leave non&minus;UTF&minus;8 files untouched. You
should check to get the correct results by doing the
conversion without <tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;notest&quot;</tt>
before, also the <tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;qfrom&quot;</tt>
option might be helpful, because the double utf&minus;8 file
names might screw up your terminal if they are being printed
&minus; they often contain control sequences which do funny
things with your terminal window. If you are not sure about
the charset which was accidently converted from, using
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;qfrom&quot;</tt> is a good way to
fiddle out the required encoding without destroying the file
names finally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How to
repair Samba files</b> <br>
When in the smb.conf (of Samba 2.x) there hasn&rsquo;t been
set a correct &quot;character set&quot; variable, files
which are created from Win* clients are being created in the
client&rsquo;s codepage, e.g. cp850 for western european
languages. As a result of that the files which contain
non-ASCII characters are screwed up if you &quot;ls&quot;
them on the Unix server. If you change the &quot;character
set&quot; variable afterwards to iso8859&minus;1, newly
created files are okay, but the old files are still screwed
up in the Windows encoding. In this case convmv can also be
used to convert the old Samba-shared files from cp850 to
iso8859&minus;1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By the way:
Samba 3.x finally maps to <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
filenames by default, so also when you migrate from Samba 2
to Samba 3 you might have to convert your file names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Netatalk
interoperability issues</b> <br>
When Netatalk is being switched to
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> which is supported in version 2
then it is <small>NOT</small> sufficient to rename the file
names. There needs to be done more. See
http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html#volumes&minus;and&minus;filenames
and the uniconv utility of Netatalk for details.</p>
