notation.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most people use
the decimal numbering system. This system uses ten symbols
to represent numbers. When those ten symbols are used up,
they start all over again and increment the position to the
left. The digit 0 is only shown if it is the only symbol in
the sequence, or if it is not the first one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this sounds
cryptic to you, this is what I&rsquo;ve just said in
numbers:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">     0
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each time the
digit nine is incremented, it is reset to 0 and the position
before (to the left) is incremented (from 0 to 1). Then
number 9 can be seen as &quot;00009&quot; and when we should
increment 9, we reset it to zero and increment the digit
just before the 9 so the number becomes &quot;00010&quot;.
Leading zeros we don&rsquo;t write except if it is the only
digit (number 0). And of course, we write zeros if they
occur anywhere inside or at the end of a number:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;00010&quot; &minus;&gt; &quot; 0010&quot; &minus;&gt; &quot; 010&quot; &minus;&gt; &quot;  10&quot;, but not &quot;  1 &quot;.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This was pretty
basic, you already knew this. Why did I tell it? Well,
computers usually do not represent numbers with 10 different
digits. They only use two different symbols, namely
&quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. Apply the same rules to
this set of digits and you get the binary numbering
system:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">     0
     1
    10
    11
   100
   101
   110
   111
  1000
  1001
  1010
  1011
  1100
  1101</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you count
the number of rows, you&rsquo;ll see that these are again 14
different numbers. The numbers are the same and mean the
same as in the first list, we just used a different
representation. This means that you have to know the
representation used, or as it is called the numbering system
or base. Normally, if we do not explicitly specify the
numbering system used, we implicitly use the decimal system.
If we want to use any other numbering system, we&rsquo;ll
have to make that clear. There are a few widely adopted
methods to do so. One common form is to write 1010(2) which
means that you wrote down a number in its binary
representation. It is the number ten. If you would write
1010 without specifying the base, the number is interpreted
as one thousand and ten using base 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In books,
another form is common. It uses subscripts (little
characters, more or less in between two rows). You can leave
out the parentheses in that case and write down the number
in normal characters followed by a little two just behind
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As the
numbering system used is also called the base, we talk of
the number 1100 base 2, the number 12 base 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within the
binary system, it is common to write leading zeros. The
numbers are written down in series of four, eight or sixteen
depending on the context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We can use the
binary form when talking to computers (...programming...),
but the numbers will have large representations. The number
65&rsquo;535 (often in the decimal system a &rsquo; is used
to separate blocks of three digits for readability) would be
written down as 1111111111111111(2) which is 16 times the
digit 1. This is difficult and prone to errors. Therefore,
we usually would use another base, called hexadecimal. It
uses 16 different symbols. First the symbols from the
decimal system are used, thereafter we continue with
alphabetic characters. We get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
A, B, C, D, E and F. This system is chosen because the
hexadecimal form can be converted into the binary system
very easily (and back).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is yet
another system in use, called the octal system. This was
more common in the old days, but is not used very often
anymore. As you might find it in use sometimes, you should
get used to it and we&rsquo;ll show it below. It&rsquo;s the
same story as with the other representations, but with eight
different symbols.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> Binary      (2)
 Octal       (8)
 Decimal     (10)
 Hexadecimal (16)
 (2)    (8) (10) (16)
 00000   0    0    0
 00001   1    1    1
 00010   2    2    2
 00011   3    3    3
 00100   4    4    4
 00101   5    5    5
 00110   6    6    6
 00111   7    7    7
 01000  10    8    8

 10101  25   21   15</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most computers
used nowadays are using bytes of eight bits. This means that
they store eight bits at a time. You can see why the octal
system is not the most practical for that: You&rsquo;d need
three digits to represent the eight bits and this means that
you&rsquo;d have to use one complete digit to represent only
two bits (2+3+3=8). This is a waste. For hexadecimal digits,
you need only two digits which are used completely:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> (2)      (8)  (10) (16)
 11111111 377  255   FF</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see why
binary and hexadecimal can be converted quickly: For each
hexadecimal digit there are exactly four binary digits. Take
a binary number: take four digits from the right and make a
hexadecimal digit from it (see the table above). Repeat this
until there are no more digits. And the other way around:
Take a hexadecimal number. For each digit, write down its
binary equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Computers (or
rather the parsers running on them) would have a hard time
converting a number like 1234(16). Therefore hexadecimal
numbers are specified with a prefix. This prefix depends on
the language you&rsquo;re writing in. Some of the prefixes
are &quot;0x&quot; for C, &quot;$&quot; for Pascal,
&quot;#&quot; for <small>HTML</small> . It is common to
assume that if a number starts with a zero, it is octal. It
does not matter what is used as long as you know what it is.
I will use &quot;0x&quot; for hexadecimal, &quot;%&quot; for
binary and &quot;0&quot; for octal. The following numbers
are all the same, just their representation (base) is
different: 021 0x11 17 <tt>%00010001</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To do
arithmetics and conversions you need to understand one more
thing. It is something you already know but perhaps you do
not &quot;see&quot; it yet:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you write
down 1234, (no prefix, so it is decimal) you are talking
about the number one thousand, two hundred and thirty four.
In sort of a formula:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 * 1000 = 1000
 2 *  100 =  200
 3 *   10 =   30
 4 *    1 =    4</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can also
be written as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 * 10^3
 2 * 10^2
 3 * 10^1
 4 * 10^0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where ^ means
&quot;to the power of&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We are using
the base 10, and the positions 0,1,2 and 3. The right-most
position should <small>NOT</small> be multiplied with 10.
The second from the right should be multiplied one time with
10. The third from the right is multiplied with 10 two
times. This continues for whatever positions are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is the same
in all other representations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0x1234 will
be</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 * 16^3
 2 * 16^2
 3 * 16^1
 4 * 16^0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">01234 would
be</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 * 8^3
 2 * 8^2
 3 * 8^1
 4 * 8^0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
can not be done for binary as that system only uses two
symbols. Another example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>%1010</tt>
would be</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1 * 2^3
 0 * 2^2
 1 * 2^1
 0 * 2^0</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It would have
been easier to convert it to its hexadecimal form and just
translate <tt>%1010</tt> into 0xA. After a while you get
used to it. You will not need to do any calculations
anymore, but just know that 0xA means 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To convert a
decimal number into a hexadecimal you could use the next
method. It will take some time to be able to do the
estimates, but it will be easier when you use the system
more frequently. We&rsquo;ll look at yet another way
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First you need
to know how many positions will be used in the other system.
To do so, you need to know the maximum numbers you&rsquo;ll
be using. Well, that&rsquo;s not as hard as it looks. In
decimal, the maximum number that you can form with two
digits is &quot;99&quot;. The maximum for three:
&quot;999&quot;. The next number would need an extra
position. Reverse this idea and you will see that the number
can be found by taking 10^3 (10*10*10 is 1000) minus 1 or
10^2 minus one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
done for hexadecimal as well:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 16^4 = 0x10000 = 65536
 16^3 =  0x1000 =  4096
 16^2 =   0x100 =   256
 16^1 =    0x10 =    16</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a number is
smaller than 65&rsquo;536 it will fit in four positions. If
the number is bigger than 4&rsquo;095, you must use position
4. How many times you can subtract 4&rsquo;096 from the
number without going below zero is the first digit you write
down. This will always be a number from 1 to 15 (0x1 to
0xF). Do the same for the other positions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s try
with 41&rsquo;029. It is smaller than 16^4 but bigger than
16^3&minus;1. This means that we have to use four positions.
We can subtract 16^3 from 41&rsquo;029 ten times without
going below zero. The left-most digit will therefore be
&quot;A&quot;, so we have 0xA????. The number is reduced to
41&rsquo;029 &minus; 10*4&rsquo;096 =
41&rsquo;029&minus;40&rsquo;960 = 69. 69 is smaller than
16^3 but not bigger than 16^2&minus;1. The second digit is
therefore &quot;0&quot; and we now have 0xA0??. 69 is
smaller than 16^2 and bigger than 16^1&minus;1. We can
subtract 16^1 (which is just plain 16) four times and write
down &quot;4&quot; to get 0xA04?. Subtract 64 from 69 (69
&minus; 4*16) and the last digit is 5 &minus;&minus;&gt;
0xA045.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The other
method builds up the number from the right. Let&rsquo;s try
41&rsquo;029 again. Divide by 16 and do not use fractions
(only whole numbers).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 41'029 / 16 is 2'564 with a remainder of 5. Write down 5.
 2'564 / 16 is 160 with a remainder of 4. Write the 4 before the 5.
 160 / 16 is 10 with no remainder. Prepend 45 with 0.
 10 / 16 is below one. End here and prepend 0xA. End up with 0xA045.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which method to
use is up to you. Use whatever works for you. I use them
both without being able to tell what method I use in each
case, it just depends on the number, I think. Fact is, some
numbers will occur frequently while programming. If the
number is close to one I am familiar with, then I will use
the first method (like 32&rsquo;770 which is into
32&rsquo;768 + 2 and I just know that it is 0x8000 + 0x2 =
0x8002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For binary the
same approach can be used. The base is 2 and not 16, and the
number of positions will grow rapidly. Using the second
method has the advantage that you can see very easily if you
should write down a zero or a one: if you divide by two the
remainder will be zero if it is an even number and one if it
is an odd number:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 41029 / 2 = 20514 remainder 1
 20514 / 2 = 10257 remainder 0
 10257 / 2 =  5128 remainder 1
  5128 / 2 =  2564 remainder 0
  2564 / 2 =  1282 remainder 0
  1282 / 2 =   641 remainder 0
   641 / 2 =   320 remainder 1
   320 / 2 =   160 remainder 0
   160 / 2 =    80 remainder 0
    80 / 2 =    40 remainder 0
    40 / 2 =    20 remainder 0
    20 / 2 =    10 remainder 0
    10 / 2 =     5 remainder 0
     5 / 2 =     2 remainder 1
     2 / 2 =     1 remainder 0
     1 / 2 below 0 remainder 1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Write down the
results from right to left: <tt>%1010000001000101</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Group by
four:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> %1010000001000101
 %101000000100 0101
 %10100000 0100 0101
 %1010 0000 0100 0101</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Convert into
hexadecimal: 0xA045</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Group
<tt>%1010000001000101</tt> by three and convert into
octal:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> %1010000001000101
 %1010000001000 101
 %1010000001 000 101
 %1010000 001 000 101
 %1010 000 001 000 101
 %1 010 000 001 000 101
 %001 010 000 001 000 101
    1   2   0   1   0   5 &minus;&minus;&gt; 0120105
 So: %1010000001000101 = 0120105 = 0xA045 = 41029
 Or: 1010000001000101(2) = 120105(8) = A045(16) = 41029(10)
 Or: 1010000001000101(2) = 120105(8) = A045(16) = 41029</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At first while
adding numbers, you&rsquo;ll convert them to their decimal
form and then back into their original form after doing the
addition. If you use the other numbering system often, you
will see that you&rsquo;ll be able to do arithmetics
directly in the base that is used. In any representation it
is the same, add the numbers on the right, write down the
right-most digit from the result, remember the other digits
and use them in the next round. Continue with the second
digit from the right and so on:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    %1010 + %0111 &minus;&minus;&gt; 10 + 7 &minus;&minus;&gt; 17 &minus;&minus;&gt; %00010001</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will become</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    %1010
    %0111 +
     ||||
     |||+&minus;&minus; add 0 + 1, result is 1, nothing to remember
     ||+&minus;&minus;&minus; add 1 + 1, result is %10, write down 0 and remember 1
     |+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus; add 0 + 1 + 1(remembered), result = 0, remember 1
     +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus; add 1 + 0 + 1(remembered), result = 0, remember 1
            nothing to add, 1 remembered, result = 1
 &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
   %10001 is the result, I like to write it as %00010001</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For low values,
try to do the calculations yourself, then check them with a
calculator. The more you do the calculations yourself, the
more you&rsquo;ll find that you didn&rsquo;t make mistakes.
In the end, you&rsquo;ll do calculi in other bases as easily
as you do them in decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
numbers get bigger, you&rsquo;ll have to realize that a
computer is not called a computer just to have a nice name.
There are many different calculators available, use them.
For Unix you could use &quot;bc&quot; which is short for
Binary Calculator. It calculates not only in decimal, but in
all bases you&rsquo;ll ever want to use (among them
Binary).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For people on
Windows: Start the calculator
(start&minus;&gt;programs&minus;&gt;accessories&minus;&gt;calculator)
and if necessary click view&minus;&gt;scientific. You now
have a scientific calculator and can compute in binary or
hexadecimal.</p>
