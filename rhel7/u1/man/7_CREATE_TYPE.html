<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>CREATE
TYPE</b></i> registers a new data type for use in the
current database. The user who defines a type becomes its
owner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a schema
name is given then the type is created in the specified
schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The
type name must be distinct from the name of any existing
type or domain in the same schema. (Because tables have
associated data types, the type name must also be distinct
from the name of any existing table in the same schema.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are five
forms of <b>CREATE TYPE</b>, as shown in the syntax synopsis
above. They respectively create a composite type, an enum
type, a range type, a base type, or a shell type. The first
four of these are discussed in turn below. A shell type is
simply a placeholder for a type to be defined later; it is
created by issuing <b>CREATE TYPE</b> with no parameters
except for the type name. Shell types are needed as forward
references when creating range types and base types, as
discussed in those sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Composite
Types</b> <br>
The first form of <b>CREATE TYPE</b> creates a composite
type. The composite type is specified by a list of attribute
names and data types. An attribute's collation can be
specified too, if its data type is collatable. A composite
type is essentially the same as the row type of a table, but
using <b>CREATE TYPE</b> avoids the need to create an actual
table when all that is wanted is to define a type. A
stand&minus;alone composite type is useful, for example, as
the argument or return type of a function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To be able to
create a composite type, you must have USAGE privilege on
all attribute types.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Enumerated
Types</b> <br>
The second form of <b>CREATE TYPE</b> creates an enumerated
(enum) type, as described in Section 8.7, &ldquo;Enumerated
Types&rdquo;, in the documentation. Enum types take a list
of one or more quoted labels, each of which must be less
than NAMEDATALEN bytes long (64 bytes in a standard
PostgreSQL build).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Range
Types</b> <br>
The third form of <b>CREATE TYPE</b> creates a new range
type, as described in Section 8.17, &ldquo;Range
Types&rdquo;, in the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The range
type's <i>subtype</i> can be any type with an associated
b&minus;tree operator class (to determine the ordering of
values for the range type). Normally the subtype's default
b&minus;tree operator class is used to determine ordering;
to use a non&minus;default opclass, specify its name with
<i>subtype_opclass</i>. If the subtype is collatable, and
you want to use a non&minus;default collation in the range's
ordering, specify the desired collation with the
<i>collation</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>canonical</i> function must take one argument of the
range type being defined, and return a value of the same
type. This is used to convert range values to a canonical
form, when applicable. See Section 8.17.8, &ldquo;Defining
New Range Types&rdquo;, in the documentation for more
information. Creating a <i>canonical</i> function is a bit
tricky, since it must be defined before the range type can
be declared. To do this, you must first create a shell type,
which is a placeholder type that has no properties except a
name and an owner. This is done by issuing the command
CREATE TYPE <i>name</i>, with no additional parameters. Then
the function can be declared using the shell type as
argument and result, and finally the range type can be
declared using the same name. This automatically replaces
the shell type entry with a valid range type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>subtype_diff</i> function must take two values of the
<i>subtype</i> type as argument, and return a double
precision value representing the difference between the two
given values. While this is optional, providing it allows
much greater efficiency of GiST indexes on columns of the
range type. See Section 8.17.8, &ldquo;Defining New Range
Types&rdquo;, in the documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Base
Types</b> <br>
The fourth form of <b>CREATE TYPE</b> creates a new base
type (scalar type). To create a new base type, you must be a
superuser. (This restriction is made because an erroneous
type definition could confuse or even crash the server.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parameters
can appear in any order, not only that illustrated above,
and most are optional. You must register two or more
functions (using <b>CREATE FUNCTION</b>) before defining the
type. The support functions <i>input_function</i> and
<i>output_function</i> are required, while the functions
<i>receive_function</i>, <i>send_function</i>,
<i>type_modifier_input_function</i>,
<i>type_modifier_output_function</i> and
<i>analyze_function</i> are optional. Generally these
functions have to be coded in C or another low&minus;level
language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>input_function</i> converts the type's external textual
representation to the internal representation used by the
operators and functions defined for the type.
<i>output_function</i> performs the reverse transformation.
The input function can be declared as taking one argument of
type cstring, or as taking three arguments of types cstring,
oid, integer. The first argument is the input text as a C
string, the second argument is the type's own OID (except
for array types, which instead receive their element type's
OID), and the third is the typmod of the destination column,
if known (&minus;1 will be passed if not). The input
function must return a value of the data type itself.
Usually, an input function should be declared STRICT; if it
is not, it will be called with a NULL first parameter when
reading a NULL input value. The function must still return
NULL in this case, unless it raises an error. (This case is
mainly meant to support domain input functions, which might
need to reject NULL inputs.) The output function must be
declared as taking one argument of the new data type. The
output function must return type cstring. Output functions
are not invoked for NULL values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>receive_function</i> converts the type's external binary
representation to the internal representation. If this
function is not supplied, the type cannot participate in
binary input. The binary representation should be chosen to
be cheap to convert to internal form, while being reasonably
portable. (For example, the standard integer data types use
network byte order as the external binary representation,
while the internal representation is in the machine's native
byte order.) The receive function should perform adequate
checking to ensure that the value is valid. The receive
function can be declared as taking one argument of type
internal, or as taking three arguments of types internal,
oid, integer. The first argument is a pointer to a
StringInfo buffer holding the received byte string; the
optional arguments are the same as for the text input
function. The receive function must return a value of the
data type itself. Usually, a receive function should be
declared STRICT; if it is not, it will be called with a NULL
first parameter when reading a NULL input value. The
function must still return NULL in this case, unless it
raises an error. (This case is mainly meant to support
domain receive functions, which might need to reject NULL
inputs.) Similarly, the optional <i>send_function</i>
converts from the internal representation to the external
binary representation. If this function is not supplied, the
type cannot participate in binary output. The send function
must be declared as taking one argument of the new data
type. The send function must return type bytea. Send
functions are not invoked for NULL values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should at
this point be wondering how the input and output functions
can be declared to have results or arguments of the new
type, when they have to be created before the new type can
be created. The answer is that the type should first be
defined as a shell type, which is a placeholder type that
has no properties except a name and an owner. This is done
by issuing the command CREATE TYPE <i>name</i>, with no
additional parameters. Then the I/O functions can be defined
referencing the shell type. Finally, <b>CREATE TYPE</b> with
a full definition replaces the shell entry with a complete,
valid type definition, after which the new type can be used
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>type_modifier_input_function</i> and
<i>type_modifier_output_function</i> are needed if the type
supports modifiers, that is optional constraints attached to
a type declaration, such as char(5) or numeric(30,2).
PostgreSQL allows user&minus;defined types to take one or
more simple constants or identifiers as modifiers. However,
this information must be capable of being packed into a
single non&minus;negative integer value for storage in the
system catalogs. The <i>type_modifier_input_function</i> is
passed the declared modifier(s) in the form of a cstring
array. It must check the values for validity (throwing an
error if they are wrong), and if they are correct, return a
single non&minus;negative integer value that will be stored
as the column &ldquo;typmod&rdquo;. Type modifiers will be
rejected if the type does not have a
<i>type_modifier_input_function</i>. The
<i>type_modifier_output_function</i> converts the internal
integer typmod value back to the correct form for user
display. It must return a cstring value that is the exact
string to append to the type name; for example numeric's
function might return (30,2). It is allowed to omit the
<i>type_modifier_output_function</i>, in which case the
default display format is just the stored typmod integer
value enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
<i>analyze_function</i> performs type&minus;specific
statistics collection for columns of the data type. By
default, <b>ANALYZE</b> will attempt to gather statistics
using the type's &ldquo;equals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;less&minus;than&rdquo; operators, if there is a
default b&minus;tree operator class for the type. For
non&minus;scalar types this behavior is likely to be
unsuitable, so it can be overridden by specifying a custom
analysis function. The analysis function must be declared to
take a single argument of type internal, and return a
boolean result. The detailed API for analysis functions
appears in src/include/commands/vacuum.h.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the
details of the new type's internal representation are only
known to the I/O functions and other functions you create to
work with the type, there are several properties of the
internal representation that must be declared to PostgreSQL.
Foremost of these is <i>internallength</i>. Base data types
can be fixed&minus;length, in which case
<i>internallength</i> is a positive integer, or variable
length, indicated by setting <i>internallength</i> to
VARIABLE. (Internally, this is represented by setting typlen
to &minus;1.) The internal representation of all
variable&minus;length types must start with a 4&minus;byte
integer giving the total length of this value of the
type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
flag PASSEDBYVALUE indicates that values of this data type
are passed by value, rather than by reference. You cannot
pass by value types whose internal representation is larger
than the size of the Datum type (4 bytes on most machines, 8
bytes on a few).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>alignment</i> parameter specifies the storage alignment
required for the data type. The allowed values equate to
alignment on 1, 2, 4, or 8 byte boundaries. Note that
variable&minus;length types must have an alignment of at
least 4, since they necessarily contain an int4 as their
first component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>storage</i> parameter allows selection of storage
strategies for variable&minus;length data types. (Only plain
is allowed for fixed&minus;length types.) plain specifies
that data of the type will always be stored in&minus;line
and not compressed. extended specifies that the system will
first try to compress a long data value, and will move the
value out of the main table row if it's still too long.
external allows the value to be moved out of the main table,
but the system will not try to compress it. main allows
compression, but discourages moving the value out of the
main table. (Data items with this storage strategy might
still be moved out of the main table if there is no other
way to make a row fit, but they will be kept in the main
table preferentially over extended and external items.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>like_type</i> parameter provides an alternative method
for specifying the basic representation properties of a data
type: copy them from some existing type. The values of
<i>internallength</i>, <i>passedbyvalue</i>,
<i>alignment</i>, and <i>storage</i> are copied from the
named type. (It is possible, though usually undesirable, to
override some of these values by specifying them along with
the LIKE clause.) Specifying representation this way is
especially useful when the low&minus;level implementation of
the new type &ldquo;piggybacks&rdquo; on an existing type in
some fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>category</i> and <i>preferred</i> parameters can be used
to help control which implicit cast will be applied in
ambiguous situations. Each data type belongs to a category
named by a single ASCII character, and each type is either
&ldquo;preferred&rdquo; or not within its category. The
parser will prefer casting to preferred types (but only from
other types within the same category) when this rule is
helpful in resolving overloaded functions or operators. For
more details see Chapter 10, Type Conversion, in the
documentation. For types that have no implicit casts to or
from any other types, it is sufficient to leave these
settings at the defaults. However, for a group of related
types that have implicit casts, it is often helpful to mark
them all as belonging to a category and select one or two of
the &ldquo;most general&rdquo; types as being preferred
within the category. The <i>category</i> parameter is
especially useful when adding a user&minus;defined type to
an existing built&minus;in category, such as the numeric or
string types. However, it is also possible to create new
entirely&minus;user&minus;defined type categories. Select
any ASCII character other than an upper&minus;case letter to
name such a category.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A default value
can be specified, in case a user wants columns of the data
type to default to something other than the null value.
Specify the default with the DEFAULT key word. (Such a
default can be overridden by an explicit DEFAULT clause
attached to a particular column.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To indicate
that a type is an array, specify the type of the array
elements using the ELEMENT key word. For example, to define
an array of 4&minus;byte integers (int4), specify ELEMENT =
int4. More details about array types appear below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To indicate the
delimiter to be used between values in the external
representation of arrays of this type, <i>delimiter</i> can
be set to a specific character. The default delimiter is the
comma (,). Note that the delimiter is associated with the
array element type, not the array type itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional
Boolean parameter <i>collatable</i> is true, column
definitions and expressions of the type may carry collation
information through use of the COLLATE clause. It is up to
the implementations of the functions operating on the type
to actually make use of the collation information; this does
not happen automatically merely by marking the type
collatable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Array
Types</b> <br>
Whenever a user&minus;defined type is created, PostgreSQL
automatically creates an associated array type, whose name
consists of the element type's name prepended with an
underscore, and truncated if necessary to keep it less than
NAMEDATALEN bytes long. (If the name so generated collides
with an existing type name, the process is repeated until a
non&minus;colliding name is found.) This
implicitly&minus;created array type is variable length and
uses the built&minus;in input and output functions array_in
and array_out. The array type tracks any changes in its
element type's owner or schema, and is dropped if the
element type is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might
reasonably ask why there is an <b>ELEMENT</b> option, if the
system makes the correct array type automatically. The only
case where it's useful to use <b>ELEMENT</b> is when you are
making a fixed&minus;length type that happens to be
internally an array of a number of identical things, and you
want to allow these things to be accessed directly by
subscripting, in addition to whatever operations you plan to
provide for the type as a whole. For example, type point is
represented as just two floating&minus;point numbers, each
can be accessed using point[0] and point[1]. Note that this
facility only works for fixed&minus;length types whose
internal form is exactly a sequence of identical
fixed&minus;length fields. A subscriptable
variable&minus;length type must have the generalized
internal representation used by array_in and array_out. For
historical reasons (i.e., this is clearly wrong but it's far
too late to change it), subscripting of fixed&minus;length
array types starts from zero, rather than from one as for
variable&minus;length arrays.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because there
are no restrictions on use of a data type once it's been
created, creating a base type or range type is tantamount to
granting public execute permission on the functions
mentioned in the type definition. This is usually not an
issue for the sorts of functions that are useful in a type
definition. But you might want to think twice before
designing a type in a way that would require
&ldquo;secret&rdquo; information to be used while converting
it to or from external form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
PostgreSQL version 8.3, the name of a generated array type
was always exactly the element type's name with one
underscore character (_) prepended. (Type names were
therefore restricted in length to one less character than
other names.) While this is still usually the case, the
array type name may vary from this in case of
maximum&minus;length names or collisions with user type
names that begin with underscore. Writing code that depends
on this convention is therefore deprecated. Instead, use
pg_type.typarray to locate the array type associated with a
given type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It may be
advisable to avoid using type and table names that begin
with underscore. While the server will change generated
array type names to avoid collisions with user&minus;given
names, there is still risk of confusion, particularly with
old client software that may assume that type names
beginning with underscores always represent arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
PostgreSQL version 8.2, the shell&minus;type creation syntax
CREATE TYPE <i>name</i> did not exist. The way to create a
new base type was to create its input function first. In
this approach, PostgreSQL will first see the name of the new
data type as the return type of the input function. The
shell type is implicitly created in this situation, and then
it can be referenced in the definitions of the remaining I/O
functions. This approach still works, but is deprecated and
might be disallowed in some future release. Also, to avoid
accidentally cluttering the catalogs with shell types as a
result of simple typos in function definitions, a shell type
will only be made this way when the input function is
written in C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In PostgreSQL
versions before 7.3, it was customary to avoid creating a
shell type at all, by replacing the functions' forward
references to the type name with the placeholder pseudotype
opaque. The cstring arguments and results also had to be
declared as opaque before 7.3. To support loading of old
dump files, <b>CREATE TYPE</b> will accept I/O functions
declared using opaque, but it will issue a notice and change
the function declarations to use the correct types.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates a composite type and uses it in a function
definition:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE
compfoo AS (f1 int, f2 text);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE FUNCTION
getfoo() RETURNS SETOF compfoo AS $$ <br>
SELECT fooid, fooname FROM foo <br>
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates an enumerated type and uses it in a table
definition:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE
bug_status AS ENUM ('new', 'open', 'closed');</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TABLE
bug ( <br>
id serial, <br>
description text, <br>
status bug_status <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates a range type:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE
float8_range AS RANGE (subtype = float8, subtype_diff =
float8mi);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates the base data type box and then uses the type in a
table definition:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE
box;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE FUNCTION
my_box_in_function(cstring) RETURNS box AS ... ; <br>
CREATE FUNCTION my_box_out_function(box) RETURNS cstring AS
... ;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE box
( <br>
INTERNALLENGTH = 16, <br>
INPUT = my_box_in_function, <br>
OUTPUT = my_box_out_function <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TABLE
myboxes ( <br>
id integer, <br>
description box <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the internal
structure of box were an array of four float4 elements, we
might instead use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE box
( <br>
INTERNALLENGTH = 16, <br>
INPUT = my_box_in_function, <br>
OUTPUT = my_box_out_function, <br>
ELEMENT = float4 <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which would
allow a box value's component numbers to be accessed by
subscripting. Otherwise the type behaves the same as
before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
creates a large object type and uses it in a table
definition:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">CREATE TYPE
bigobj ( <br>
INPUT = lo_filein, OUTPUT = lo_fileout, <br>
INTERNALLENGTH = VARIABLE <br>
); <br>
CREATE TABLE big_objs ( <br>
id integer, <br>
obj bigobj <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More examples,
including suitable input and output functions, are in
Section 35.11, &ldquo;User-defined Types&rdquo;, in the
documentation.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first form
of the <b>CREATE TYPE</b> command, which creates a composite
type, conforms to the SQL standard. The other forms are
PostgreSQL extensions. The <b>CREATE TYPE</b> statement in
the SQL standard also defines other forms that are not
implemented in PostgreSQL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ability to
create a composite type with zero attributes is a
PostgreSQL&minus;specific deviation from the standard
(analogous to the same case in <b>CREATE TABLE</b>).</p>
