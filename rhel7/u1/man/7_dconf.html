configuration systen</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf is a
simple key/value storage system that is heavily optimised
for reading. This makes it an ideal system for storing user
preferences (which are read 1000s of times for each time the
user changes one). It was created with this usecase in
mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All preferences
are stored in a single large binary file. Layering of
preferences is possible using multiple files (ie: for site
defaults). Lock&minus;down is also supported. The binary
file for the defaults can optionally be compiled from a set
of plain text keyfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf has a
partial client/server architecture. It uses D&minus;Bus. The
server is only involved in writes (and is not activated in
the user session until the user modifies a preference). The
service is stateless and can exit freely at any time (and is
therefore robust against crashes). The list of paths that
each process is watching is stored within the D&minus;Bus
daemon itself (as D&minus;Bus signal match rules).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads are
performed by direct access (via mmap) to the on&minus;disk
database which is essentially a hashtable. For this reason,
dconf reads typically involve zero system calls and are
comparable to a hashtable lookup in terms of speed.
Practically speaking, in simple non&minus;layered setups,
dconf is less than 10 times slower than GHashTable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writes are
assumed only to happen in response to explicit user
interaction (like clicking on a checkbox in a preferences
dialog) and are therefore not optimised at all. On some file
systems, dconf&minus;service will call fsync() for every
write, which can introduce a latency of up to 100ms. This
latency is hidden by the client libraries through a clever
&quot;fast&quot; mechanism that records the outstanding
changes locally (so they can be read back immediately) until
the service signals that a write has completed.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dconf mostly
targets Free Software operating systems. It will
theoretically run on Mac OS but there isn't much point to
that (since Mac OS applications want to store preferences in
plist files). It is not possible to use dconf on Windows
because of the inability to rename over a file that's still
in use (which is what the dconf&minus;service does on every
write).</p>

<h2>API STABILITY
<a name="API STABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dconf API
is not particularly friendly, and is not guaranteed to be
stable. Because of this and the lack of portability, you
almost certainly want to use some sort of wrapper API around
it. The wrapper API used by GTK+ and GNOME applications is
<b><font color="#0000FF">GSettings</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">, which is included as part of GLib.
GSettings has backends for Windows (using the registry) and
Mac OS (using property lists) as well as its dconf backend
and is the proper API to use for graphical
applications.</font></p>
