<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>Direct
Rendering Manager</i> (DRM) is a framework to manage
<i>Graphics Processing Units</i> (GPUs). It is designed to
support the needs of complex graphics devices, usually
containing programmable pipelines well suited to 3D graphics
acceleration. Furthermore, it is responsible for memory
management, interrupt handling and DMA to provide a uniform
interface to applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In earlier
days, the kernel framework was solely used to provide raw
hardware access to priviledged user&minus;space processes
which implement all the hardware abstraction layers. But
more and more tasks where moved into the kernel. All these
interfaces are based on <b>ioctl</b>(2) commands on the DRM
character device. The <i>libdrm</i> library provides
wrappers for these system&minus;calls and many helpers to
simplify the API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a GPU is
detected, the DRM system loads a driver for the detected
hardware type. Each connected GPU is then presented to
user&minus;space via a character&minus;device that is
usually available as /dev/dri/card0 and can be accessed with
<b>open</b>(2) and <b>close</b>(2). However, it still
depends on the grapics driver which interfaces are available
on these devices. If an interface is not available, the
syscalls will fail with EINVAL.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Authentication</b>
<br>
All DRM devices provide authentication mechanisms. Only a
DRM&minus;Master is allowed to perform mode&minus;setting or
modify core state and only one user can be DRM&minus;Master
at a time. See <b>drmSetMaster</b>(3) for information on how
to become DRM&minus;Master and what the limitations are.
Other DRM users can be authenticated to the DRM&minus;Master
via <b>drmAuthMagic</b>(3) so they can perform buffer
allocations and rendering.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mode&minus;Setting</b>
<br>
Managing connected monitors and displays and changing the
current modes is called <i>Mode&minus;Setting</i>. This is
restricted to the current DRM&minus;Master. Historically,
this was implemented in user&minus;space, but new DRM
drivers implement a kernel interface to perform
mode&minus;setting called <i>Kernel Mode Setting</i> (KMS).
If your hardware&minus;driver supports it, you can use the
KMS API provided by DRM. This includes allocating
framebuffers, selecting modes and managing CRTCs and
encoders. See <b>drm-kms</b>(7) for more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Memory
Management</b> <br>
The most sophisticated tasks for GPUs today is managing
memory objects. Textures, framebuffers,
command&minus;buffers and all other kinds of commands for
the GPU have to be stored in memory. The DRM driver takes
care of managing all memory objects, flushing caches,
synchronizing access and providing CPU access to GPU memory.
All memory management is hardware driver dependent. However,
two generic frameworks are available that are used by most
DRM drivers. These are the <i>Translation Table Manager</i>
(TTM) and the <i>Graphics Execution Manager</i> (GEM). They
provide generic APIs to create, destroy and access buffers
from user&minus;space. However, there are still many
differences between the drivers so driver&minus;depedent
code is still needed. Many helpers are provided in
<i>libgbm</i> (Graphics Buffer Manager) from the
<i>mesa&minus;project</i>. For more information on DRM
memory&minus;management, see <b>drm-memory</b>(7).</p>
