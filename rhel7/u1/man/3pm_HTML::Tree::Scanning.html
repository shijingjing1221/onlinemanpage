Sean M. Burke</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In <i>The Perl
Journal</i> issue 17, Ken MacFarlane&rsquo;s article
&quot;Parsing <small>HTML</small> with HTML::Parser&quot;
describes how the HTML::Parser module scans
<small>HTML</small> source as a stream of start-tags,
end-tags, text, comments, etc. In <small>TPJ</small> #18, my
&quot;Trees&quot; article kicked around the idea of
tree-shaped data structures. Now I&rsquo;ll try to tie it
together, in a discussion of <small>HTML</small> trees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>CPAN</small> module HTML::TreeBuilder takes the tags
that HTML::Parser picks out, and builds a parse tree -- a
tree-shaped network of objects...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Footnote: And
if you need a quick explanation of objects, see my
<small>TPJ17</small> article &quot;A User&rsquo;s View of
Object-Oriented Modules&quot;; or go whole hog and get
Damian Conway&rsquo;s excellent book <i>Object-Oriented
Perl</i>, from Manning Publications.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...representing
the structured content of the <small>HTML</small> document.
And once the document is parsed as a tree, you&rsquo;ll find
the common tasks of extracting data from that
<small>HTML</small> document/tree to be quite
straightforward.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>HTML::Parser,
HTML::TreeBuilder, and HTML::Element</b> <br>
You use HTML::TreeBuilder to make a parse tree out of an
<small>HTML</small> source file, by simply saying:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use HTML::TreeBuilder;
  my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder&minus;&gt;new();
  $tree&minus;&gt;parse_file('foo.html');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then
<tt>$tree</tt> contains a parse tree built from the
<small>HTML</small> source from the file
&quot;foo.html&quot;. The way this parse tree is represented
is with a network of objects -- <tt>$tree</tt> is the root,
an element with tag-name &quot;html&quot;, and its children
typically include a &quot;head&quot; and &quot;body&quot;
element, and so on. Elements in the tree are objects of the
class HTML::Element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, if you take
this source:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Doc 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  Stuff &lt;hr&gt; 2000&minus;08&minus;17
  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and feed it to
HTML::TreeBuilder, it&rsquo;ll return a tree of objects that
looks like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">               html
             /      \
         head        body
        /          /   |  \
     title    &quot;Stuff&quot;  hr  &quot;2000&minus;08&minus;17&quot;
       |
    &quot;Doc 1&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
pretty simple document, but if it were any more complex,
it&rsquo;d be a bit hard to draw in that style, since
it&rsquo;s sprawl left and right. The same tree can be
represented a bit more easily sideways, with indenting:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  . html
     . head
        . title
           . &quot;Doc 1&quot;
     . body
        . &quot;Stuff&quot;
        . hr
        . &quot;2000&minus;08&minus;17&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Either way
expresses the same structure. In that structure, the root
node is an object of the class HTML::Element</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Footnote: Well
actually, the root is of the class HTML::TreeBuilder, but
that&rsquo;s just a subclass of HTML::Element, plus the few
extra methods like <tt>&quot;parse_file&quot;</tt> that
elaborate the tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">, with the tag
name &quot;html&quot;, and with two children: an
HTML::Element object whose tag names are &quot;head&quot;
and &quot;body&quot;. And each of those elements have
children, and so on down. Not all elements (as we&rsquo;ll
call the objects of class HTML::Element) have children --
the &quot;hr&quot; element doesn&rsquo;t. And note all nodes
in the tree are elements -- the text nodes (&quot;Doc
1&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, and
&quot;2000&minus;08&minus;17&quot;) are just strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Objects of the
class HTML::Element each have three noteworthy attributes:
<br>
&quot;_tag&quot; -- (best accessed as
&quot;$e&minus;&gt;tag&quot;) this element&rsquo;s tag-name,
<br>
lowercased (e.g., &quot;em&quot; for an &quot;em&quot;
element).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Footnote: Yes, this is
misnamed. In proper <small>SGML</small> terminology, this is
instead called a &quot; <small>GI&quot;,</small> short for
&quot;generic identifier&quot;; and the term &quot;tag&quot;
is used for a token of <small>SGML</small> source that
represents either the start of an element (a start-tag like
&quot;&lt;em lang=&rsquo;fr&rsquo;&gt;&quot;) or the end of
an element (an end-tag like &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.
However, since more people claim to have been abducted by
aliens than to have ever seen the <small>SGML</small>
standard, and since both encounters typically involve a
feeling of &quot;missing time&quot;, it&rsquo;s not
surprising that the terminology of the <small>SGML</small>
standard is not closely followed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;_parent&quot; -- (best
accessed as &quot;$e&minus;&gt;parent&quot;) the element
that is $obj&rsquo;s <br>
parent, or undef if this element is the root of its tree.
<br>
&quot;_content&quot; -- (best accessed as
&quot;$e&minus;&gt;content_list&quot;) the list of nodes
<br>
(i.e., elements or text segments) that are $e&rsquo;s
children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Moreover, if an
element object has any attributes in the <small>SGML</small>
sense of the word, then those are readable as
<tt>&quot;$e&minus;&gt;attr('name')&quot;</tt> -- for
example, with the object built from having parsed
&quot;&lt;a
<b>id=&rsquo;foo&rsquo;</b>&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,
<tt>&quot;$e&minus;&gt;attr('id')&quot;</tt> will return the
string &quot;foo&quot;. Moreover,
<tt>&quot;$e&minus;&gt;tag&quot;</tt> on that object returns
the string &quot;a&quot;,
<tt>&quot;$e&minus;&gt;content_list&quot;</tt> returns a
list consisting of just the single scalar &quot;bar&quot;,
and <tt>&quot;$e&minus;&gt;parent&quot;</tt> returns the
object that&rsquo;s this node&rsquo;s parent -- which may
be, for example, a &quot;p&quot; element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And
that&rsquo;s all that there is to it -- you throw
<small>HTML</small> source at TreeBuilder, and it returns a
tree built of HTML::Element objects and some text
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, what
do you <i>do</i> with a tree of objects? People code
information into <small>HTML</small> trees not for the fun
of arranging elements, but to represent the structure of
specific text and images -- some text is in this
&quot;li&quot; element, some other text is in that heading,
some images are in that other table cell that has those
attributes, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, it may
happen that you&rsquo;re rendering that whole
<small>HTML</small> tree into some layout format. Or you
could be trying to make some systematic change to the
<small>HTML</small> tree before dumping it out as
<small>HTML</small> source again. But, in my experience, by
far the most common programming task that Perl programmers
face with <small>HTML</small> is in trying to extract some
piece of information from a larger document. Since
that&rsquo;s so common (and also since it involves concepts
that are basic to more complex tasks), that is what the rest
of this article will be about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scanning
<small>HTML</small> trees</b> <br>
Suppose you have a thousand <small>HTML</small> documents,
each of them a press release. They all start out:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  [...lots of leading images and junk...]
  &lt;h1&gt;ConGlomCo to Open New Corporate Office in Ougadougou&lt;/h1&gt;
  BAKERSFIELD, CA, 2000&minus;04&minus;24 &minus;&minus; ConGlomCo's vice president in charge
  of world conquest, Rock Feldspar, announced today the opening of a
  new office in Ougadougou, the capital city of Burkino Faso, gateway
  to the bustling &quot;Silicon Sahara&quot; of Africa...
  [...etc...]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...and what
you&rsquo;ve got to do is, for each document, copy whatever
text is in the &quot;h1&quot; element, so that you can, for
example, make a table of contents of it. Now, there are
three ways to do this:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>You can just use a regexp to scan the file for a text
pattern.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For many very
simple tasks, this will do fine. Many <small>HTML</small>
documents are, in practice, very consistently formatted as
far as placement of linebreaks and whitespace, so you could
just get away with scanning the file like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  sub get_heading {
    my $filename = $_[0];
    local *HTML;
    open(HTML, $filename)
      or die &quot;Couldn't open $filename);
    my $heading;
   Line:
    while(&lt;HTML&gt;) {
      if( m{&lt;h1&gt;(.*?)&lt;/h1&gt;}i ) {  # match it!
        $heading = $1;
        last Line;
      }
    }
    close(HTML);
    warn &quot;No heading in $filename?&quot;
     unless defined $heading;
    return $heading;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is quick
and fast, but awfully fragile -- if there&rsquo;s a newline
in the middle of a heading&rsquo;s text, it won&rsquo;t
match the above regexp, and you&rsquo;ll get an error. The
regexp will also fail if the &quot;h1&quot; element&rsquo;s
start-tag has any attributes. If you have to adapt your code
to fit more kinds of start-tags, you&rsquo;ll end up
basically reinventing part of HTML::Parser, at which point
you should probably just stop, and use HTML::Parser
itself:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use HTML::Parser to scan
the file for an &quot;h1&quot; start-tag token, then capture
all the text tokens until the &quot;h1&quot; close-tag. This
approach is extensively covered in the Ken
MacFarlane&rsquo;s <small>TPJ17</small> article
&quot;Parsing <small>HTML</small> with HTML::Parser&quot;.
(A variant of this approach is to use HTML::TokeParser,
which presents a different and rather handier interface to
the tokens that HTML::Parser picks out.)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using
HTML::Parser is less fragile than our first approach, since
it&rsquo;s not sensitive to the exact internal formatting of
the start-tag (much less whether it&rsquo;s split across two
lines). However, when you need more information about the
context of the &quot;h1&quot; element, or if you&rsquo;re
having to deal with any of the tricky bits of
<small>HTML,</small> such as parsing of tables, you&rsquo;ll
find out the flat list of tokens that HTML::Parser returns
isn&rsquo;t immediately useful. To get something useful out
of those tokens, you&rsquo;ll need to write code that knows
some things about what elements take no content (as with
&quot;hr&quot; elements), and that a &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
end-tags are omissible, so a &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; will end
any currently open paragraph -- and you&rsquo;re well on
your way to pointlessly reinventing much of the code in
HTML::TreeBuilder</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Footnote: And,
as the person who last rewrote that module, I can attest
that it wasn&rsquo;t terribly easy to get right! Never
underestimate the perversity of people coding
<small>HTML.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">, at which
point you should probably just stop, and use
HTML::TreeBuilder itself:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use HTML::Treebuilder,
and scan the tree of element objects that you get back.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last
approach, using HTML::TreeBuilder, is the diametric opposite
of first approach: The first approach involves just
elementary Perl and one regexp, whereas the TreeBuilder
approach involves being at home with the concept of
tree-shaped data structures and modules with object-oriented
interfaces, as well as with the particular interfaces that
HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element provide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, what
the TreeBuilder approach has going for it is that it&rsquo;s
the most robust, because it involves dealing with
<small>HTML</small> in its &quot;native&quot; format -- it
deals with the tree structure that <small>HTML</small> code
represents, without any consideration of how the source is
coded and with what tags omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, to extract
the text from the &quot;h1&quot; elements of an
<small>HTML</small> document:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub get_heading {
    my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder&minus;&gt;new;
    $tree&minus;&gt;parse_file($_[0]);   # !
    my $heading;
    my $h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'h1');  # !
    if($h1) {
      $heading = $h1&minus;&gt;as_text;   # !
    } else {
      warn &quot;No heading in $_[0]?&quot;;
    }
    $tree&minus;&gt;delete; # clear memory!
    return $heading;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This uses some
unfamiliar methods that need explaining. The
<tt>&quot;parse_file&quot;</tt> method that we&rsquo;ve seen
before, builds a tree based on source from the file given.
The <tt>&quot;delete&quot;</tt> method is for marking a
tree&rsquo;s contents as available for garbage collection,
when you&rsquo;re done with the tree. The
<tt>&quot;as_text&quot;</tt> method returns a string that
contains all the text bits that are children (or otherwise
descendants) of the given node -- to get the text content of
the <tt>$h1</tt> object, we could just say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $heading = join '', $h1&minus;&gt;content_list;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but that will
work only if we&rsquo;re sure that the &quot;h1&quot;
element&rsquo;s children will be only text bits -- if the
document contained:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt; Again&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then the
sub-tree would be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  . h1
    . &quot;Local Man Sees &quot;
    . cite
      . &quot;Blade&quot;
    . &quot; Again'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so
<tt>&quot;join '', $h1&minus;&gt;content_list&quot;</tt>
will be something like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  Local Man Sees HTML::Element=HASH(0x15424040) Again</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">whereas
<tt>&quot;$h1&minus;&gt;as_text&quot;</tt> would yield:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  Local Man Sees Blade Again</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and depending
on what you&rsquo;re doing with the heading text, you might
want the <tt>&quot;as_HTML&quot;</tt> method instead. It
returns the (sub)tree represented as <small>HTML</small>
source. <tt>&quot;$h1&minus;&gt;as_HTML&quot;</tt> would
yield:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;h1&gt;Local Man Sees &lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt; Again&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
wanted the contents of <tt>$h1</tt> as <small>HTML,</small>
but not the <tt>$h1</tt> itself, you could say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  join '',
    map(
      ref($_) ? $_&minus;&gt;as_HTML : $_,
      $h1&minus;&gt;content_list
    )</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
<tt>&quot;map&quot;</tt> iterates over the nodes in
<tt>$h1</tt>&rsquo;s list of children; and for each node
that&rsquo;s just a text bit (as &quot;Local Man Sees &quot;
is), it just passes through that string value, and for each
node that&rsquo;s an actual object (causing
<tt>&quot;ref&quot;</tt> to be true),
<tt>&quot;as_HTML&quot;</tt> will used instead of the string
value of the object itself (which would be something quite
useless, as most object values are). So that
<tt>&quot;as_HTML&quot;</tt> for the &quot;cite&quot;
element will be the string
&quot;&lt;cite&gt;Blade&lt;/cite&gt;&quot;. And then,
finally, <tt>&quot;join&quot;</tt> just puts into one string
all the strings that the <tt>&quot;map&quot;</tt>
returns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Last but not
least, the most important method in our
<tt>&quot;get_heading&quot;</tt> sub is the
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> method. This method looks
down at the subtree starting at the given object
(<tt>$h1</tt>), looking for elements that meet criteria you
provide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The criteria
are specified in the method&rsquo;s argument list. Each
criterion can consist of two scalars, a key and a value,
which express that you want elements that have that
attribute (like &quot;_tag&quot;, or &quot;src&quot;) with
the given value (&quot;h1&quot;); or the criterion can be a
reference to a subroutine that, when called on the given
element, returns true if that is a node you&rsquo;re looking
for. If you specify several criteria, then that&rsquo;s
taken to mean that you want all the elements that each
satisfy <i>all</i> the criteria. (In other words,
there&rsquo;s an &quot;implicit <small>AND&quot;.</small>
)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And finally,
there&rsquo;s a bit of an optimization -- if you call the
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> method in a scalar context,
you get just the <i>first</i> node (or undef if none) --
and, in fact, once <tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> finds that
first matching element, it doesn&rsquo;t bother looking any
further.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So the
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'h1');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">returns the
first element at-or-under <tt>$tree</tt> whose
<tt>&quot;_tag&quot;</tt> attribute has the value
<tt>&quot;h1&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Complex
Criteria in Tree Scanning</b> <br>
Now, the above <tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> code looks
like a lot of bother, with barely more benefit than just
grepping the file! But consider if your criteria were more
complicated -- suppose you found that some of the press
releases that you were scanning had several &quot;h1&quot;
elements, possibly before or after the one you actually
want. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;Visit Our Corporate Partner
   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/dyna/clickthru&quot;
     &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/dyna/vend_ad&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;center&gt;ConGlomCo President Schreck to Visit Regional HQ
   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/photos/Schreck_visit_large.jpg&quot;
     &gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/photos/Schreck_visit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, you want
to ignore the first &quot;h1&quot; element because it
contains an ad, and you want the text from the second
&quot;h1&quot;. The problem is in formalizing the way you
know that it&rsquo;s an ad. Since ad banners are always
entreating you to &quot;visit&quot; the sponsoring site, you
could exclude &quot;h1&quot; elements that contain the word
&quot;visit&quot; under them:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $real_h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      $_[0]&minus;&gt;as_text !~ m/\bvisit/i
    }
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
criterion looks for &quot;h1&quot; elements, and the second
criterion limits those to only the ones whose text content
doesn&rsquo;t match <tt>&quot;m/\bvisit/&quot;</tt>. But
unfortunately, that won&rsquo;t work for our example, since
the second &quot;h1&quot; mentions &quot;ConGlomCo President
Schreck to <i>Visit</i> Regional
<small>HQ&quot;.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead you
could try looking for the first &quot;h1&quot; element that
doesn&rsquo;t contain an image:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $real_h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      not $_[0]&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'img')
    }
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This criterion
sub might seem a bit odd, since it calls
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> as part of a larger
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> operation, but that&rsquo;s
fine. Note that when considered as a boolean value, a
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> in a scalar context value
returns false (specifically, undef) if there&rsquo;s no
matching element at or under the given element; and it
returns the first matching element (which, being a reference
and object, is always a true value), if any matches. So,
here,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub {
    not $_[0]&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'img')
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">means
&quot;return true only if this element has no
&rsquo;img&rsquo; element as descendants (and isn&rsquo;t an
&rsquo;img&rsquo; element itself).&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This correctly
filters out the first &quot;h1&quot; that contains the ad,
but it also incorrectly filters out the second
&quot;h1&quot; that contains a non-advertisement photo
besides the headline text you want.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There clearly
are detectable differences between the first and second
&quot;h1&quot; elements -- the only second one contains the
string &quot;Schreck&quot;, and we could just test for
that:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $real_h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      $_[0]&minus;&gt;as_text =~ m{Schreck}
    }
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And that works
fine for this one example, but unless all thousand of your
press releases have &quot;Schreck&quot; in the headline,
that&rsquo;s just not a general solution. However, if all
the ads&minus;in&minus;&quot;h1&quot;s that you want to
exclude involve a link whose <small>URL</small> involves
&quot;/dyna/&quot;, then you can use that:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $real_h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      my $link = $_[0]&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag','a');
      return 1 unless $link;
        # no link means it's fine
      return 0 if $link&minus;&gt;attr('href') =~ m{/dyna/};
        # a link to there is bad
      return 1; # otherwise okay
    }
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you can look
at it another way and say that you want the first
&quot;h1&quot; element that either contains no images, or
else whose image has a &quot;src&quot; attribute whose value
contains &quot;/photos/&quot;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $real_h1 = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    sub {
      my $img = $_[0]&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag','img');
      return 1 unless $img;
        # no image means it's fine
      return 1 if $img&minus;&gt;attr('src') =~ m{/photos/};
        # good if a photo
      return 0; # otherwise bad
    }
  );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Recall that
this use of <tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> in a scalar
context means to return the first element at or under
<tt>$tree</tt> that matches all the criteria. But if you
notice that you can formulate criteria that&rsquo;ll match
several possible &quot;h1&quot; elements, some of which may
be bogus but the <i>last</i> one of which is always the one
you want, then you can use <tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> in
a list context, and just use the last element of that
list:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my @h1s = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'h1',
    ...maybe more criteria...
  );
  die &quot;What, no h1s here?&quot; unless @h1s;
  my $real_h1 = $h1s[&minus;1]; # last or only</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A Case
Study: Scanning Yahoo News&rsquo;s <small>HTML</small></b>
<br>
The above (somewhat contrived) case involves extracting data
from a bunch of pre-existing <small>HTML</small> files. In
that sort of situation, if your code works for all the
files, then you know that the code <i>works</i> -- since the
data it&rsquo;s meant to handle won&rsquo;t go changing or
growing; and, typically, once you&rsquo;ve used the program,
you&rsquo;ll never need to use it again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The other kind
of situation faced in many data extraction tasks is where
the program is used recurringly to handle new data -- such
as from ever-changing Web pages. As a real-world example of
this, consider a program that you could use (suppose
it&rsquo;s crontabbed) to extract headline-links from
subsections of Yahoo News
(<tt>&quot;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Yahoo News has
several subsections: <br>
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/tc/ for technology news <br>
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/sc/ for science news <br>
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/hl/ for health news <br>
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/wl/ for world news <br>
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/en/ for entertainment news</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and others. All
of them are built on the same basic <small>HTML</small>
template -- and a scarily complicated template it is,
especially when you look at it with an eye toward making up
rules that will select where the real headline-links are,
while screening out all the links to other parts of Yahoo,
other news services, etc. You will need to puzzle over the
<small>HTML</small> source, and scrutinize the output of
<tt>&quot;$tree&minus;&gt;dump&quot;</tt> on the parse tree
of that <small>HTML.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the
only way to pin down what you&rsquo;re after is by position
in the tree. For example, headlines of interest may be in
the third column of the second row of the second table
element in a page:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $table = ( $tree&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag','table') )[1];
  my $row2  = ( $table&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'tr' ) )[1];
  my $col3  = ( $row2&minus;&gt;look&minus;down('_tag', 'td')   )[2];
  ...then do things with $col3...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or they may be
all the links in a &quot;p&quot; element that has at least
three &quot;br&quot; elements as children:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  my $p = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(
    '_tag', 'p',
    sub {
      2 &lt; grep { ref($_) and $_&minus;&gt;tag eq 'br' }
               $_[0]&minus;&gt;content_list
    }
  );
  @links = $p&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag', 'a');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But almost
always, you can get away with looking for properties of the
of the thing itself, rather than just looking for contexts.
Now, if you&rsquo;re lucky, the document you&rsquo;re
looking through has clear semantic tagging, such is as
useful in <small>CSS</small> -- note the
class=&quot;headlinelink&quot; bit here:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;a href=&quot;...long_news_url...&quot; class=&quot;headlinelink&quot;&gt;Elvis
  seen in tortilla&lt;/a&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
anything like that, you could leap right in and select links
with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  @links = $tree&minus;&gt;look_down('class','headlinelink');</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regrettably,
your chances of seeing any sort of semantic markup
principles really being followed with actual
<small>HTML</small> are pretty thin.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Footnote: In
fact, your chances of finding a page that is simply free of
<small>HTML</small> errors are even thinner. And
surprisingly, sites like Amazon or Yahoo are typically worse
as far as quality of code than personal sites whose entire
production cycle involves simply being saved and uploaded
from Netscape Composer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The code may be
sort of &quot;accidentally semantic&quot;, however -- for
example, in a set of pages I was scanning recently, I found
that looking for &quot;td&quot; elements with a
&quot;width&quot; attribute value of &quot;375&quot; got me
exactly what I wanted. No-one designing that page ever
conceived of &quot;width=375&quot; as <i>meaning</i>
&quot;this is a headline&quot;, but if you impute it to mean
that, it works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An approach
like this happens to work for the Yahoo News code, because
the headline-links are distinguished by the fact that they
(and they alone) contain a &quot;b&quot; element:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  &lt;a href=&quot;...long_news_url...&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elvis seen in tortilla&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or, diagrammed
as a part of the parse tree:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  . a  [href=&quot;...long_news_url...&quot;]
    . b
      . &quot;Elvis seen in tortilla&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A rule that
matches these can be formalized as &quot;look for any
&rsquo;a&rsquo; element that has only one daughter node,
which must be a &rsquo;b&rsquo; element&quot;. And this is
what it looks like when cooked up as a
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> expression and prefaced with
a bit of code that retrieves the text of the given Yahoo
News page and feeds it to TreeBuilder:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use strict;
  use HTML::TreeBuilder 2.97;
  use LWP::UserAgent;
  sub get_headlines {
    my $url = $_[0] || die &quot;What URL?&quot;;
    my $response = LWP::UserAgent&minus;&gt;new&minus;&gt;request(
      HTTP::Request&minus;&gt;new( GET =&gt; $url )
    );
    unless($response&minus;&gt;is_success) {
      warn &quot;Couldn't get $url: &quot;, $response&minus;&gt;status_line, &quot;\n&quot;;
      return;
    }
    my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder&minus;&gt;new();
    $tree&minus;&gt;parse($response&minus;&gt;content);
    $tree&minus;&gt;eof;
    my @out;
    foreach my $link (
      $tree&minus;&gt;look_down(   # !
        '_tag', 'a',
        sub {
          return unless $_[0]&minus;&gt;attr('href');
          my @c = $_[0]&minus;&gt;content_list;
          @c == 1 and ref $c[0] and $c[0]&minus;&gt;tag eq 'b';
        }
      )
    ) {
      push @out, [ $link&minus;&gt;attr('href'), $link&minus;&gt;as_text ];
    }
    warn &quot;Odd, fewer than 6 stories in $url!&quot; if @out &lt; 6;
    $tree&minus;&gt;delete;
    return @out;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...and add a
bit of code to actually call that routine and display the
results...</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  foreach my $section (qw[tc sc hl wl en]) {
    my @links = get_headlines(
      &quot;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/$section/&quot;
    );
    print
      $section, &quot;: &quot;, scalar(@links), &quot; stories\n&quot;,
      map((&quot;  &quot;, $_&minus;&gt;[0], &quot; : &quot;, $_&minus;&gt;[1], &quot;\n&quot;), @links),
      &quot;\n&quot;;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And we&rsquo;ve
got our own headline-extractor service! This in and of
itself isn&rsquo;t no amazingly useful (since if you want to
see the headlines, you <i>can</i> just look at the Yahoo
News pages), but it could easily be the basis for quite
useful features like filtering the headlines for matching
certain keywords of interest to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, one of
these days, Yahoo News will decide to change its
<small>HTML</small> template. When this happens, this will
appear to the above program as there being no links that
meet the given criteria; or, less likely, dozens of
erroneous links will meet the criteria. In either case, the
criteria will have to be changed for the new template; they
may just need adjustment, or you may need to scrap them and
start over.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Regardez,
duvet!</i> <br>
It&rsquo;s often quite a challenge to write criteria to
match the desired parts of an <small>HTML</small> parse
tree. Very often you <i>can</i> pull it off with a simple
<tt>&quot;$tree&minus;&gt;look_down('_tag',
'h1')&quot;</tt>, but sometimes you do have to keep adding
and refining criteria, until you might end up with complex
filters like what I&rsquo;ve shown in this article. The
benefit to learning how to deal with <small>HTML</small>
parse trees is that one main search tool, the
<tt>&quot;look_down&quot;</tt> method, can do most of the
work, making simple things easy, while still making hard
things possible.</p>
