<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip::Objects
&minus; A description of the various Date::Manip objects</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Date::Manip
package consist of several modules, each of which perform a
set of operations on a specific class of objects. This
document describes how the various modules work
together.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Manip
consists of the following primary modules: <b><br>
Date::Manip::Obj</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Date::Manip::Obj module is
not intended for direct use. It is used as a base class for
all other Date::Manip classes described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
Date::Manip::Obj module contains some functions which are
inherited by all these classes, so to understand all of the
methods available to any of the classes below, you must
include those documented in the Date::Manip::Obj class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date::Manip::Base</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Date::Manip::Base is used
to perform basic operations including basic date operations,
management of configuration options, handling the
definitions used in different languages, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
Date::Manip::Base object does not, of itself, contain any
date information. Instead, it contains configuration
information which determines how the Date::Manip package
performs date operations. The configuration information is
documented in the Date::Manip::Config document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
Date::Manip::Base object has one other property that is very
important. When performing basic date operations, some
intermediate results are cached in the object which leads to
significant performance increases in later operations. As
such, it is important to reuse the object as much as
possible, rather than creating new Date::Manip::Base objects
all the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Much of the
information in this document is related to this issue, and
tells how to create various higher-level objects in order to
get the most efficient reuse of this cached data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because all
other objects depend on a Date::Manip::Base object, a
Date::Manip::Base object is embedded in all other objects,
and the same Base object can be shared by any number of
objects to achieve maximum performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date::Manip::TZ</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Date::Manip::TZ module adds
support for time zones. It is used to verify date and time
zone information, convert dates from one time zone to
another, and handle all daylight saving time
transitions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to the
Date::Manip::Base object, a great deal of information is
cached in the Date::Manip::TZ object. This includes lists of
all time zones, offsets, and abbreviations for all time
zones. It also includes more a more detailed description of
every time zone that has actually been worked used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
Date::Manip::TZ object relies on a Date::Manip::Base object
(and a Date::Manip::Base object is always embedded in a
Date::Manip::TZ object). All higher level objects (those
listed next) depend on both a Date::Manip::Base and
Date::Manip::TZ object, so a Date::Manip::TZ object is
embedded in them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
achieve maximum performance, and minimize memory usage, a
Date::Manip::TZ object can be shared by any number of higher
level objects, and in fact, it is desirable to reuse the
same Date::Manip::TZ object as often as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Date::Manip::Date <br>
Date::Manip::Delta <br>
Date::Manip::Recur</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These are the primary modules
which are used to perform all high level date
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
Date::Manip::Date class performs operations on dates (which
includes a date, time, and time zone). The
Date::Manip::Delta class performs operations with deltas
(amounts of time). The Date::Manip::Recur class performs
operations on recurring events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned
above, each of these high level classes rely on both a
Date::Manip::TZ object and a Date::Manip::Base object, so a
Date::Manip::TZ object is embedded in each one (and the
Date::Manip::TZ object has a Date::Manip::Base object
embedded in it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
Date::Manip::Date object contains a single date, so in order
to work with multiple dates, multiple Date::Manip::Date
objects will need to be created. In order to make the most
effective use of cached information in the Date::Manip::Base
object, the same Date::Manip::TZ object can be embedded in
each of the higher level objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The same goes
for multiple Date::Manip::Delta and Date::Manip::Recur
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
many secondary modules including:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   Date::Manip::TZ_Base
   Date::Manip::TZdata
   Date::Manip::Zones
   Date::Manip::Lang::*
   Date::Manip::TZ::*
   Date::Manip::Offset::*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None of these
are intended to be used directly.</p>

<h2>WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (SINGLE CONFIGURATION)
<a name="WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (SINGLE CONFIGURATION)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By far the most
common usage of Date::Manip involves setting a single local
time zone, parsing dates in a single language, and having
all other configuration parameters set to a single value
that doesn&rsquo;t change over the course of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever this
is the case, you can use the methods listed in this section
to create any number of Date::Manip objects. It will
automatically optimize the use of cached data to get the
best performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do need
to work with multiple different configurations (such as
parsing dates from multiple languages), please refer to the
next section <small>WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS</small>
( <small>MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS</small> ). <b><br>
Working with high level objects</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The most common situation is
one where you will need to use one or more high level
objects (Date, Delta, or Recur objects). In addition, you
may want to use the lower level (Base or <small>TZ</small> )
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The first thing
you should do is to create your initial object. Create the
highest level object you will be using. For example if you
will be working with dates, create the first date object
with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date = new Date::Manip::Date;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The next step
is to set the configuration values. Use the config method to
do this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date&minus;&gt;config(ARGS);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Although you
can call the config method later, it is strongly suggested
that the configuration be set soon after the initial object
is created and not altered later. Every time you alter the
configuration, some of the cached data is cleared, so for
optimal performance, you don&rsquo;t want to alter the
configuration if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
high-level objects can be created using the calls:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date2 = $date&minus;&gt;new_date();
   $delta = $date&minus;&gt;new_delta();
   $recur = $date&minus;&gt;new_recur();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To access the
embedded Date::Manip::TZ and Date::Manip::Base objects, use
the calls:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $tz    = $date&minus;&gt;tz();
   $base  = $date&minus;&gt;base();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Working with low level
objects only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you will only be working
with low level objects, create them with one of the
calls:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $tz    = new Date::Manip::TZ;
   $base  = new Date::Manip::Base;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To get the base
object embedded in a Date::Manip::TZ object, use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $base  = $tz&minus;&gt;base();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
complete description of the methods used here, refer to the
Date::Manip::Obj document.</p>

<h2>WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (MULTIPLE CONFIGURATION)
<a name="WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (MULTIPLE CONFIGURATION)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Occasionally,
it may be useful to have multiple sets of configurations. In
order to do this, multiple Date::Manip::Base objects must be
created (each with their own set of configuration options),
and then new Date::Manip objects are created with the
appropriate Date::Manip::Base object embedded in them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Possible
reasons include: <b><br>
Parsing multiple languages</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Date::Manip::Base object
includes information about a single language. If you need to
parse dates from two (or more) languages, a
Date::Manip::Base object needs to be created for each one.
This could be done as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date_eng1 = new Date::Manip::Date;
   $date_eng1&minus;&gt;config(&quot;language&quot;,&quot;English&quot;);
   $date_spa1 = new Date::Manip::Date;
   $date_spa1&minus;&gt;config(&quot;language&quot;,&quot;Spanish&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any additional
Date::Manip objects created from the first will work with
English. Additional objects created from the second will
work in Spanish.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Business modes for different
countries and/or businesses</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you are doing business mode
calculations (see Date::Manip::Calc) for two different
businesses which have different holiday lists, work weeks,
or business days, you can create different objects which
read different config files (see Date::Manip::Config) with
the appropriate description of each.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
issue when dealing with multiple configurations is that it
is necessary for the programmer to manually keep track of
which Date::Manip objects work with each configuration. For
example, refer to the following lines:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   $date1 = new Date::Manip::Date [$opt1,$val1];
   $date2 = new Date::Manip::Date $date1, [$opt2,$val2];
   $date3 = new Date::Manip::Date $date1;
   $date4 = new Date::Manip::Date $date2;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
creates 3 objects: a Date::Manip::Base object, a
Date::Manip::TZ object, and a Date::Manip::Date object). The
Date::Manip::Base object has the configuration set to
contain the value(s) passed in as the final list reference
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second line
creates 3 new objects (a second Date::Manip::Base object, a
second Date::Manip::TZ object, and a second
Date::Manip::Date object). Since a list reference containing
config variables is passed in, a new Date::Manip::Base
object is created, rather than reusing the first one. The
second Date::Manip::Base object contains all the config from
the first, as well as the config variables passed in in the
list reference argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third line
creates another Date::Manip::Date object which uses the
first Date::Manip::Base and Date::Manip::TZ objects embedded
in it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth line
creates another Date::Manip::Date object which uses the
second Date::Manip::Base and Date::Manip::TZ objects
embedded in it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
time there will only be one set of configuration options
used, so this complexity is really for a very special, and
not widely used, bit of functionality.</p>

<h2>WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (ADDITIONAL NOTES)
<a name="WORKING WITH DATE::MANIP OBJECTS (ADDITIONAL NOTES)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>object
reuse</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In order to create additional
Date::Manip objects, a previously created object should be
passed in as the first argument. This will allow the same
Base object to be embedded in both in order to maximize data
reuse of the cached intermediate results, and will result in
much better performance. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   $date1 = new Date::Manip::Date;
   $date2 = new Date::Manip::Date $date1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is
important for two reasons. First is memory usage. The
Date::Manip::Base object is quite large. It stores a large
number of precompile regular expressions for language
parsing, and as date operations are done, intermediate
results are cached which can be reused later to improve
performance. The Date::Manip::TZ object is even larger and
contains information about all known time zones indexed
several different ways (by offset, by abbreviation, etc.).
As time zones are actually used, a description of all of the
time change rules are loaded and added to this object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since these
objects are so large, it is important to reuse them, rather
than to create lots of copies of them. It should be noted
that because these objects are embedded in each of the high
level object (Date::Manip::Date for example), it makes these
objects appear quite large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The second
reason to reuse Date::Manip::Base objects is performance.
Since intermediate results are cached there, many date
operations only need to be done once and then they can be
reused any number of times. In essence, this is doing the
same function as the Memoize module, but in a more efficient
manner. Memoize caches results for function calls. For
Date::Manip, this would often work, but if you change a
config variable, the return value may change, so Memoize
could cause things to break. In addition, Memoize caches
primarily at the function level, but Date::Manip stores
caches intermediate results wherever performance increase is
seen. Every time I consider caching a result, I run a test
to see if it increases performance. If it doesn&rsquo;t, or
it doesn&rsquo;t make a significant impact, I don&rsquo;t
cache it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
caching is quite finely tuned, it&rsquo;s much more
efficient than using a generic (though useful) tool such as
Memoize.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>configuration
changes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a general rule, you should
only pass in configuration options when the first object is
created. In other words, the following behavior is
discouraged:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $date = new Date::Manip::Date;
    $date&minus;&gt;config(@opts);
    ... do some stuff
    $date&minus;&gt;config(@opts);
    ... do some other stuff</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because some of
the cached results are configuration specific, when a
configuration change is made, some of the cached data must
be discarded necessitating those results to be
recalculated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you really
need to change configuration in the middle of execution, it
is certainly allowed of course, but if you can define the
configuration once immediately after the object is first
created, and then leave the configuration alone, performance
will be optimized.</p>
