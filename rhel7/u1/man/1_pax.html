<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>pax</b>
utility shall read, write, and write lists of the members of
archive files and copy directory hierarchies. A variety of
archive formats shall be supported; see the <b>&minus;x</b>
format option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The action to
be taken depends on the presence of the <b>&minus;r</b> and
<b>&minus;w</b> options. The four combinations of
<b>&minus;r</b> and <b>&minus;w</b> are referred to as the
four modes of operation: <b>list</b>, <b>read</b>,
<b>write</b>, and <b>copy</b> modes, corresponding
respectively to the four forms shown in the SYNOPSIS
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>list</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">In <b>list</b> mode (when
neither <b>&minus;r</b> nor <b>&minus;w</b> are specified),
<b>pax</b> shall write the names of the members of the
archive file read from the standard input, with pathnames
matching the specified <i>patterns</i>, to standard output.
If a named file is of type directory, the file hierarchy
rooted at that file shall be listed as well.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>read</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>In <b>read</b> mode (when <b>&minus;r</b> is specified,
but <b>&minus;w</b> is not), <b>pax</b> shall extract the
members of the archive file read from the standard input,
with pathnames matching the specified <i>patterns</i>. If an
extracted file is of type directory, the file hierarchy
rooted at that file shall be extracted as well. The
extracted files shall be created performing pathname
resolution with the directory in which <b>pax</b> was
invoked as the current working directory.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If an attempt
is made to extract a directory when the directory already
exists, this shall not be considered an error. If an attempt
is made to extract a FIFO when the FIFO already exists, this
shall not be considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The ownership,
access, and modification times, and file mode of the
restored files are discussed under the <b>&minus;p</b>
option.</p>

<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">In <b>write</b> mode (when
<b>&minus;w</b> is specified, but <b>&minus;r</b> is not),
<b>pax</b> shall write the contents of the file operands to
the standard output in an archive format. If no file
operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one per
line, shall be read from the standard input. A file of type
directory shall include all of the files in the file
hierarchy rooted at the file.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>copy</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>In <b>copy</b> mode (when both <b>&minus;r</b> and
<b>&minus;w</b> are specified), <b>pax</b> shall copy the
file operands to the destination directory.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If no file
operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one per
line, shall be read from the standard input. A file of type
directory shall include all of the files in the file
hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
the <b>copy</b> shall be as if the copied files were written
to an archive file and then subsequently extracted, except
that there may be hard links between the original and the
copied files. If the destination directory is a subdirectory
of one of the files to be copied, the results are
unspecified. If the destination directory is a file of a
type not defined by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, the results are implementation-defined;
otherwise, it shall be an error for the file named by the
directory operand not to exist, not be writable by the user,
or not be a file of type directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In <b>read</b>
or <b>copy</b> modes, if intermediate directories are
necessary to extract an archive member, <b>pax</b> shall
perform actions equivalent to the <b>mkdir</b>() function
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, called with the following arguments:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any
specified <i>pattern</i> or <i>file</i> operands are not
matched by at least one file or archive member, <b>pax</b>
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error for each
one that did not match and exit with a non-zero exit
status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The archive
formats described in the <b>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</b> section
shall be automatically detected on input. The default output
archive format shall be implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>spax</b>
implementation defaults to <b>&minus;x ustar</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A single
archive can span multiple files. The <b>pax</b> utility
shall determine, in an implementation-defined manner, what
file to read or write as the next file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the selected
archive format supports the specification of linked files,
it shall be an error if these files cannot be linked when
the archive is extracted, except that if the files to be
linked are symbolic links and the system is not capable of
making hard links to symbolic links, then separate copies of
the symbolic link shall be created instead. For archive
formats that do not store file contents with each name that
causes a hard link, if the file that contains the data is
not extracted during this <b>pax</b> session, either the
data shall be restored from the original file, or a
diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of a
file that can be used to extract the data. In traversing
directories, <b>pax</b> shall detect infinite loops; that
is, entering a previously visited directory that is an
ancestor of the last file visited. When it detects an
infinite loop, <b>pax</b> shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error and shall terminate.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS

<b>&minus;o</b>, <b>&minus;p</b>, and <b>&minus;s</b>

Although this format may be thought of as being stored on
9-track industry-standard 12.7 mm (0.5 in) magnetic tape,
other types of transportable media are not excluded. Each

record that describes the file, followed by zero or more
logical records that give the contents of the file. At the
end of the archive file there shall be two 512-octet logical
records filled with binary zeros, interpreted as an
end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The logical
records may be grouped for physical I/O operations, as
described under the <b>&minus;b</b> <i>blocksize</i> and
<b>&minus;x</b> <i>ustar</i> options. Each group of logical

the <b>write</b>(2) function. On magnetic tape, the result
of this write shall be a single tape physical block. The
last physical block shall always be the full size, so
logical records after the two zero logical records may
contain undefined data.</p>

portability between implementations, names should be
selected from characters represented by the portable

<i>magic</i>, <i>uname</i>, and <i>gname</i> are character
strings each terminated by a NUL character. The fields

the characters &quot;00&quot; (zero-zero). The
<i>typeflag</i> contains a single character. All other

from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV. Each numeric field
is terminated by one or more &lt;space&gt; or NUL
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>name</i>

the file. A new pathname shall be formed, if <i>prefix</i>
is not an empty string (its first character is not NUL), by
concatenating <i>prefix</i> (up to the first NUL character),
a slash character, and <i>name</i>; otherwise, <i>name</i>
is used alone. In either case, <i>name</i> is terminated at
the first NUL character. If <i>prefix</i> begins with a NUL

at most 256 characters can be supported. If a pathname does

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

set to specify a file of type 5 (directory), the size field
shall be interpreted as described under the definition of
that record type. No data logical records are stored for
types 1, 2, or 5. If the typeflag field is set to 3

If the <i>typeflag</i> field is set to any other value, the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Caution is
advised when using the <b>&minus;a</b> option to append to a
<i>cpio</i> format archive. If any of the files being
appended happen to be given the same <i>c_dev</i> and
<i>c_ino</i> values as a file in the existing part of the
archive, then they may be treated as links to that file on
extraction. Thus, it is risky to use <b>&minus;a</b> with
<i>cpio</i> format except when it is done on the same system
that the original archive was created on, and with the same
<b>pax</b> utility, and in the knowledge that there has been
little or no file system activity since the original archive
was created that could lead to any of the files appended
being given the same <i>c_dev</i> and <i>c_ino</i> values as
an unrelated file in the existing part of the archive. Also,
when (intentionally) appending additional links to a file in
the existing part of the archive, the <i>c_nlink</i> values
in the modified archive can be smaller than the number of
links to the file in the archive, which may mean that the
links are not preserved on extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;p</b> (privileges) option was invented to
reconcile differences between historical <b>tar</b> and
<b>cpio</b> implementations. In particular, the two
utilities use <b>&minus;m</b> in diametrically opposed ways.
The <b>&minus;p</b> option also provides a consistent means
of extending the ways in which future file attributes can be
addressed, such as for enhanced security systems or
high-performance files. Although it may seem complex, there
are really two modes that are most commonly used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;&lsquo;Preserve
everything&quot;. This would be used by the historical
superuser, someone with all the appropriate privileges, to
preserve all aspects of the files as they are recorded in
the archive. The <b>e</b> flag is the sum of <b>o</b> and
<b>p</b>, and other implementation-defined attributes.</p></td></tr>

<p><b>&minus;p p</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Preserve&quot; the file mode bits. This
would be used by the user with regular privileges who wished
to preserve aspects of the file other than the ownership.
The file times are preserved by default, but two other flags
are offered to disable these and use the time of
extraction.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The one
pathname per line format of standard input precludes
pathnames containing &lt;newline&gt;s. Although such
pathnames violate the portable filename guidelines, they may
exist and their presence may inhibit usage of <b>pax</b>
within shell scripts. This problem is inherited from
historical archive programs. The problem can be avoided by
listing filename arguments on the command line instead of on
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is almost
certain that appropriate privileges are required for
<b>pax</b> to accomplish parts of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Specifically, creating files of type block
special or character special, restoring file access times
unless the files are owned by the user (the <b>&minus;t</b>
option), or preserving file owner, group, and mode (the
<b>&minus;p</b> option) all probably require appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In <b>read</b>
mode, implementations are permitted to overwrite files when
the archive has multiple members with the same name. This
may fail if permissions on the first version of the file do
not permit it to be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>cpio</b>
and <b>ustar</b> formats can only support files up to
8589934592 bytes (8 * 2^30) in size.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>pax</b>
utility was new for the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard. It
represents a peaceful compromise between advocates of the
historical <b>tar</b> and <b>cpio</b> utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A fundamental
difference between <b>cpio</b> and <b>tar</b> was in the way
directories were treated. The <b>cpio</b> utility did not
treat directories differently from other files, and to
select a directory and its contents required that each file
in the hierarchy be explicitly specified. For <b>tar</b>, a
directory matched every file in the file hierarchy it
rooted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>pax</b>
utility offers both interfaces; by default, directories map
into the file hierarchy they root. The <b>&minus;d</b>
option causes <b>pax</b> to skip any file not explicitly
referenced, as <i>cpio</i> historically did. The <b>tar</b>
- style behavior was chosen as the default because it was
believed that this was the more common usage and because
<b>tar</b> is the more commonly available interface, as it
was historically provided on both System V and BSD
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The data
interchange format specification in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires that processes with &quot;appropriate
privileges&quot; shall always restore the ownership and
permissions of extracted files exactly as archived. If
viewed from the historic equivalence between superuser and
&quot;appropriate privileges&quot;, there are two problems
with this requirement. First, users running as superusers
may unknowingly set dangerous permissions on extracted
files. Second, it is needlessly limiting, in that superusers
cannot extract files and own them as superuser unless the
archive was created by the superuser. (It should be noted
that restoration of ownerships and permissions for the
superuser, by default, is historical practice in
<i>cpio</i>, but not in <b>tar</b>.) In order to avoid these
two problems, the <i>pax</i> specification has an additional
&quot;privilege&quot; mechanism, the <b>&minus;p</b> option.
Only a <b>pax</b> invocation with the privileges needed, and
which has the <b>&minus;p</b> option set using the <b>e</b>
specification character, has the &quot;appropriate
privilege&quot; to restore full ownership and permission
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that the file
ownership and access permissions shall be set, on
extraction, in the same fashion as the <b>creat</b>(2)
function when provided with the mode stored in the archive.
This means that the file creation mask of the user is
applied to the file permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users should
note that directories may be created by <b>pax</b> while
extracting files with permissions that are different from
those that existed at the time the archive was created. When
extracting sensitive information into a directory hierarchy
that no longer exists, users are encouraged to set their
file creation mask appropriately to protect these files
during extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The table of
contents output is written to standard output to facilitate
pipeline processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An early
proposal had hard links displaying for all pathnames. This
was removed because it complicates the output of the case
where <b>&minus;v</b> is not specified and does not match
historical <b>cpio</b> usage. The hard-link information is
available in the <b>&minus;v</b> display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The description
of the <b>&minus;l</b> option allows implementations to make
hard links to symbolic links. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
specify any way to create a hard link to a symbolic link,
but many implementations provide this capability as an
extension. If there are hard links to symbolic links when an
archive is created, the implementation is required to
archive the hard link in the archive (unless <b>&minus;H</b>
or <b>&minus;L</b> is specified). When in <b>read</b> mode
and in <b>copy</b> mode, implementations supporting hard
links to symbolic links should use them when
appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The archive
formats inherited from the POSIX.1-1990 standard have
certain restrictions that have been brought along from
historical usage. For example, there are restrictions on the
length of pathnames stored in the archive. When <b>pax is
used in copy</b> (<b>&minus;rw</b>) mode (copying directory
hierarchies), the ability to use extensions from the
<b>&minus;x</b> <i>pax</i> format overcomes these
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
blocksize value of 5120 bytes for <b>cpio</b> was selected
because it is one of the standard block-size values for
<b>cpio</b>, set when the <b>&minus;B</b> option is
specified. (The other default block-size value for
<b>cpio</b> is 512 bytes, and this was considered to be too
small.) The default block value of 10240 bytes for
<b>tar</b> was selected because that is the standard
block-size value for BSD <b>tar</b>. The maximum block size
of 32256 bytes (2^15-512 bytes) is the largest multiple of
512 bytes that fits into a signed 16-bit tape controller
transfer register. There are known limitations in some
historical systems that would prevent larger blocks from
being accepted. Historical values were chosen to improve
compatibility with historical scripts using <b>dd</b>(1) or
similar utilities to manipulate archives. Also, default
block sizes for any file type other than character special
file has been deleted from this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 as unimportant and not likely to affect the
structure of the resulting archive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementations
are permitted to modify the block-size value based on the
archive format or the device to which the archive is being
written. This is to provide implementations with the
opportunity to take advantage of special types of devices,
and it should not be used without a great deal of
consideration as it almost certainly decreases archive
portability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The intended
use of the <b>&minus;n</b> option was to permit extraction
of one or more files from the archive without processing the
entire archive. This was viewed by the standard developers
as offering significant performance advantages over
historical implementations. The <b>&minus;n</b> option in
early proposals had three effects; the first was to cause
special characters in patterns to not be treated specially.
The second was to cause only the first file that matched a
pattern to be extracted. The third was to cause <b>pax</b>
to write a diagnostic message to standard error when no file
was found matching a specified pattern. Only the second
behavior is retained by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
for many reasons. First, it is in general not acceptable for
a single option to have multiple effects. Second, the
ability to make pattern matching characters act as normal
characters is useful for parts of <b>pax</b> other than file
extraction. Third, a finer degree of control over the
special characters is useful because users may wish to
normalize only a single special character in a single
filename. Fourth, given a more general escape mechanism, the
previous behavior of the <b>&minus;n</b> option can be
easily obtained using the <b>&minus;s</b> option or a sed
script. Finally, writing a diagnostic message when a pattern
specified by the user is unmatched by any file is useful
behavior in all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
version, the <b>&minus;n</b> was removed from the copy mode
synopsis of <b>pax</b>; it is inapplicable because there are
no pattern operands specified in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
another method than <b>pax</b> for copying subtrees in IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 described as part of the <b>cp</b>(1)
utility. Both methods are historical practice: <b>cp</b>(1)
provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while
<b>pax</b> offers a finer granularity of control. Each
provides additional functionality to the other; in
particular, <b>pax</b> maintains the hard-link structure of
the hierarchy while <b>cp</b>(1) does not. It is the
intention of the standard developers that the results be
similar (using appropriate option combinations in both
utilities). The results are not required to be identical;
there seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance
the difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that
the results would be exactly identical.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A single
archive may span more than one file. It is suggested that
implementations provide informative messages to the user on
standard error whenever the archive file is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;d</b> option (do not create intermediate
directories not listed in the archive) found in early
proposals was originally provided as a complement to the
historic <b>&minus;d</b> option of <b>cpio</b>. It has been
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;s</b> option in early proposals specified a subset
of the substitution command from the ed utility. As there
was no reason for only a subset to be supported, the
<b>&minus;s</b> option is now compatible with the current ed
specification. Since the delimiter can be any non-null
character, the following usage with single spaces is
valid:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pax &minus;s
&quot; foo bar &quot; ...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>&minus;t
description is worded so as to note that this may cause
the</b> access time update caused by some other activity
(which occurs while the file is being read) to be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior of <b>pax</b> with regard to file modification
times is the same as historical implementations of
<b>tar</b>. It is not the historical behavior of
<b>cpio</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
<b>&minus;i</b> option uses <b>/dev/tty</b>, utilities
without a controlling terminal are not able to use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;y</b> option, found in early proposals, has been
deleted because a line containing a single period for the
<b>&minus;i</b> option has equivalent functionality. The
special lines for the <b>&minus;i</b> option (a single
period and the empty line) are historical practice in
<b>cpio</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In early
drafts, a <b>&minus;e</b> <i>charmap</i> option was included
to increase portability of files between systems using
different coded character sets. This option was omitted
because it was apparent that consensus could not be formed
for it. In this version, the use of UTF-8 should be an
adequate substitute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;k</b> option was added to address international
concerns about the dangers involved in the character set
transformations of <b>&minus;e</b> (if the target character
set were different from the source, the filenames might be
transformed into names matching existing files) and also was
made more general to protect files transferred between file
systems with different <i>{NAME_MAX}</i> values (truncating
a filename on a smaller system might also inadvertently
overwrite existing files). As stated, it prevents any
overwriting, even if the target file is older than the
source. This version adds more granularity of options to
solve this problem by introducing the <b>&minus;o
invalid=</b><i>option</i> &minus; specifically the UTF-8
action. (Note that an existing file that is named with a
UTF-8 encoding is still subject to overwriting in this case.
The <b>&minus;k</b> option closes that loophole.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
file characteristics referenced in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 might not be supported by some archive formats.
For example, neither the <b>tar</b> nor <b>cpio</b> formats
contain the file access time. For this reason, the <b>e</b>
specification character has been provided, intended to cause
all file characteristics specified in the archive to be
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is required
that extracted directories, by default, have their access
and modification times and permissions set to the values
specified in the archive. This has obvious problems in that
the directories are almost certainly modified after being
extracted and that directory permissions may not permit file
creation. One possible solution is to create directories
with the mode specified in the archive, as modified by the
<i>umask</i> of the user, with sufficient permissions to
allow file creation. After all files have been extracted,
<b>pax</b> would then reset the access and modification
times and permissions as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list-mode
formatting description borrows heavily from the one defined
by the <b>printf</b>(1) utility. However, since there is no
separate operand list to get conversion arguments, the
format was extended to allow specifying the name of the
conversion argument as part of the conversion
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>T</b>
conversion specifier allows time fields to be displayed in
any of the date formats. Unlike the <b>ls</b>(1) utility,
<b>pax</b> does not adjust the format when the date is less
than six months in the past. This makes parsing the output
more predictable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>D</b>
conversion specifier handles the ability to display the
major/minor or file size, as with <b>ls</b>(1), by using
%-8(size)D.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>L</b>
conversion specifier handles the ls display for symbolic
links.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conversion
specifiers were added to generate existing known types used
for <b>ls</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pax
Interchange Format</b> <br>
The new POSIX data interchange format was developed
primarily to satisfy international concerns that the
<b>ustar</b> and <b>cpio</b> formats did not provide for
file, user, and group names encoded in characters outside a
subset of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. The standard
developers realized that this new POSIX data interchange
format should be very extensible because there were other
requirements they foresaw in the near future:</p>

<p>Industry experience since the original

<b>ustar</b> format, which is generally the default output
format selected for <b>pax</b> implementations on new
systems.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new format
was designed with one additional goal in mind: reasonable
behavior when an older <b>tar</b> or <b>pax</b> utility
happened to read an archive. Since the POSIX.1-1990 standard
mandated that a &quot;format-reading utility&quot; had to
treat unrecognized <i>typeflag</i> values as regular files,
this allowed the format to include all the extended
information in a pseudo-regular file that preceded each real
file. An option is given that allows the archive creator to
set up reasonable names for these files on the older
systems. Also, the normative text suggests that reasonable
file access values be used for this <b>ustar</b> header
block. Making these header files inaccessible for convenient
reading and deleting would not be reasonable. File
permissions of 600 or 700 are suggested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ustar
<i>typeflag</i> field was used to accommodate the additional
functionality of the new format rather than <i>magic</i> or
<i>version</i> because the POSIX.1-1990 standard (and, by
reference, the previous version of <b>pax</b>), mandated the
behavior of the format-reading utility when it encountered
an unknown <i>typeflag</i>, but was silent about the other
two fields.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Early proposals
of the first revision to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 contained a
proposed archive format that was based on compatibility with
the standard for tape files (ISO 1001, similar to the format
used historically on many mainframes and minicomputers).
This format was overly complex and required considerable
overhead in volume and header records. Furthermore, the
standard developers felt that it would not be acceptable to
the community of POSIX developers, so it was later changed
to be a format more closely related to historical practice
on POSIX systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>prefix</i> and <i>name</i> split of pathnames in
<b>ustar</b> was replaced by the single path extended header
record for simplicity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The concept of
a global extended header (typeflag <b>g</b>) was
controversial. If this were applied to an archive being
recorded on magnetic tape, a few unreadable blocks at the
beginning of the tape could be a serious problem; a utility
attempting to extract as many files as possible from a
damaged archive could lose a large percentage of file header
information in this case. However, if the archive were on a
reliable medium, such as a CD-ROM, the global extended
header offers considerable potential size reductions by
eliminating redundant information. Thus, the text warns
against using the global method for unreliable media and
provides a method for implanting global information in the
extended header for each file, rather than in the
<i>typeflag</i> <b>g</b> records.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No facility for
data translation or filtering on a per-file basis is
included because the standard developers could not invent an
interface that would allow this in an efficient manner. If a
filter, such as encryption or compression, is to be applied
to all the files, it is more efficient to apply the filter
to the entire archive as a single file. The standard
developers considered interfaces that would invoke a shell
script for each file going into or out of the archive, but
the system overhead in this approach was considered to be
too high.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One such
approach would be to have <b>filter=</b> records that give a
pathname for an executable. When the program is invoked, the
file and archive would be open for standard input/output and
all the header fields would be available as environment
variables or command-line arguments. The standard developers
did discuss such schemes, but they were omitted from IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 due to concerns about excessive overhead.
Also, the program itself would need to be in the archive if
it were to be used portably.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
currently no portable means of identifying the character
set(s) used for a file in the file system. Therefore,
<b>pax</b> has not been given a mechanism to generate
charset records automatically. The only portable means of
doing this is for the user to write the archive using the
<i>&minus;o charset=</i>string command line option. This
assumes that all of the files in the archive use the same
encoding. The &quot;implementation-defined&quot; text is
included to allow for a system that can identify the
encodings used for each of its files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The table of
standards that accompanies the charset record description is
acknowledged to be very limited. Only a limited number of
character set standards is reasonable for maximal
interchange. Any character set is, of course, possible by
prior agreement. It was suggested that EBCDIC be listed, but
it was omitted because it is not defined by a formal
standard. Formal standards, and then only those with
reasonably large followings, can be included here, simply as
a matter of practicality. The <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>s
represent names of officially registered character sets in
the format required by the ISO 2375:1985 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The normal
comma or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list rules are not followed
in the case of keyword options to allow ease of argument
parsing for <b>getopts</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Further
information on character encodings is in <b>pax</b> Archive
<b>Character Set Encoding/Decoding</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
developers have reserved keyword name space for vendor
extensions. It is suggested that the format to be used
is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>VENDOR.</b><i>keyword</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>VENDOR</b> is the name of the vendor or organization in
all uppercase letters. It is further suggested that the
keyword following the period be named differently than any
of the standard keywords so that it could be used for future
standardization, if appropriate, by omitting the
<b>VENDOR</b> prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;<i>length</i>&gt; field in the extended header record
was included to make it simpler to step through the records,
even if a record contains an unknown format (to a particular
<b>pax</b>) with complex interactions of special characters.
It also provides a minor integrity checkpoint within the
records to aid a program attempting to recover files from a
damaged archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are no
extended header versions of the <i>devmajor</i> and
<i>devminor</i> fields because the unspecified format
<b>ustar</b> header field should be sufficient. If they are
not, vendor-specific extended keywords (such as
<b>VENDOR.devmajor</b>) should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Device and
i-number labeling of files was not adopted from <b>cpio</b>;
files are interchanged strictly on a symbolic name basis, as
in <b>ustar</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just as with
the <b>ustar</b> format descriptions, the new format makes
no special arrangements for multi-volume archives. Each of
the <b>pax</b> archive types is assumed to be inside a
single POSIX file and splitting that file over multiple
volumes (diskettes, tape cartridges, and so on), processing
their labels, and mounting each in the proper sequence are
considered to be implementation details that cannot be
described portably.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>pax</b>
format is intended for interchange, not only for backup on a
single (family of) systems. It is not as densely packed as
might be possible for backup:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
requirements on restoring from an archive are slightly
different from the historical wording, allowing for
non-monolithic privilege to bring forward as much as
possible. In particular, attributes such as &quot;high
performance file&quot; might be broadly but not universally
granted while set-user-ID or <b>chown</b>(2) might be much
more restricted. There is no implication in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 that the security information be honored after
it is restored to the file hierarchy, in spite of what might
be improperly inferred by the silence on that topic. That is
a topic for another standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Links are
recorded in the fashion described here because a link can be
to any file type. It is desirable in general to be able to
restore part of an archive selectively and restore all of
those files completely. If the data is not associated with
each link, it is not possible to do this. However, the data
associated with a file can be large, and when selective
restoration is not needed, this can be a significant burden.
The archive is structured so that files that have no
associated data can always be restored by the name of any
link name of any link, and the user may choose whether data
is recorded with each instance of a file that contains data.
The format permits mixing of both types of links in a single
archive; this can be done for special needs, and <b>pax</b>
is expected to interpret such archives on input properly,
despite the fact that there is no <b>pax</b> option that
would force this mixed case on output. (When <b>&minus;o</b>
<i>linkdata</i> is used, the output must contain the
duplicate data, but the implementation is free to include it
or omit it when <b>&minus;o</b> <i>linkdata</i> is not
used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The time values
are included as extended header records for those
implementations needing more than the eleven octal digits
allowed by the <b>ustar</b> format. Portable file timestamps
cannot be negative. If <b>pax</b> encounters a file with a
negative timestamp in <b>copy</b> or <b>write</b> mode, it
can reject the file, substitute a non-negative timestamp, or
generate a non-portable timestamp with a leading
&rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;. Even though some implementations can
support finer file-time granularities than seconds, the
normative text requires support only for seconds since the
Epoch because the ISO POSIX-1 standard states them that way.
The <b>ustar</b> format includes only <i>mtime</i>; the new
format adds <i>atime</i> and <i>ctime</i> for symmetry. The
atime access time restored to the file system will be
affected by the <b>&minus;p</b> <i>a</i> and <b>&minus;p</b>
<i>e</i> options. The <i>ctime</i> creation time (actually
<i>inode</i> modification time) is described with
&quot;appropriate privilege&quot; so that it can be ignored
when writing to the file system. POSIX does not provide a
portable means to change file creation time. Nothing is
intended to prevent a non-portable implementation of
<b>pax</b> from restoring the value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>gid</i>,
<i>size</i>, and <i>uid</i> extended header records were
included to allow expansion beyond the sizes specified in
the regular <b>tar</b> header. New file system architectures
are emerging that will exhaust the 12-digit size field.
There are probably not many systems requiring more than 8
digits for user and group IDs, but the extended header
values were included for completeness, allowing overrides
for all of the decimal values in the <b>tar</b> header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
developers intended to describe the effective results of
<b>pax</b> with regard to file ownerships and permissions;
implementations are not restricted in timing or sequencing
the restoration of such, provided the results are as
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Much of the
text describing the extended headers refers to use in
&quot;<b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> modes&quot;. The
<b>copy</b> mode references are due to the normative text:
&quot;The effect of the copy shall be as if the copied files
were written to an archive file and then subsequently
extracted ...&quot;. There is certainly no way to test
whether <b>pax</b> is actually generating the extended
headers in <b>copy</b> mode, but the effects must be as if
it had.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pax Archive
Character Set Encoding/Decoding</b> <br>
There is a need to exchange archives of files between
systems of different native codesets. Filenames, group
names, and user names must be preserved to the fullest
extent possible when an archive is read on the receiving
platform. Translation of the contents of files is not within
the scope of the <b>pax</b> utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There will also
be the need to represent characters that are not available
on the receiving platform. These unsupported characters
cannot be automatically folded to the local set of
characters due to the chance of collisions. This could
result in overwriting previous extracted files from the
archive or pre-existing files on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these
reasons, the codeset used to represent characters within the
extended header records of the <b>pax</b> archive must be
sufficiently rich to handle all commonly used character
sets. The fields requiring translation include, at a
minimum, filenames, user names, group names, and link
pathnames. Implementations may wish to have localized
extended keywords that use non-portable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
developers considered the following options:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&bull;</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive creator specifies
the well-defined name of the source codeset. The receiver
must then recognize the codeset name and perform the
appropriate translations to the destination codeset.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>&bull;</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The archive creator includes within the archive the
character mapping table for the source codeset used to
encode extended header records. The receiver must then read
the character mapping table and perform the appropriate
translations to the destination codeset.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>&bull;</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The archive creator translates the extended header
records in the source codeset into a canonical form. The
receiver must then perform the appropriate translations to
the destination codeset.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The approach
that incorporates the name of the source codeset poses the
problem of codeset name registration, and makes the archive
useless to <b>pax</b> archive decoders that do not recognize
that codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because parts
of an archive may be corrupted, the standard developers felt
that including the character map of the source codeset was
too fragile. The loss of this one key component could result
in making the entire archive useless. (The difference
between this and the global extended header decision was
that the latter has a workaround-duplicating extended header
records on unreliable media-but this would be too burdensome
for large character set maps.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of the
above approaches also put an undue burden on the <b>pax</b>
archive receiver to handle the cross-product of all source
and destination codesets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To simplify the
translation from the source codeset to the canonical form
and from the canonical form to the destination codeset, the
standard developers decided that the internal representation
should be a stateless encoding. A stateless encoding is one
where each codepoint has the same meaning, without regard to
the decoder being in a specific state. An example of a
stateful encoding would be the Japanese Shift-JIS; an
example of a stateless encoding would be the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard (equivalent to 7-bit ASCII).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these
reasons, the standard developers decided to adopt a
canonical format for the representation of file information
strings. The obvious, well-endorsed candidate is the ISO/IEC
10646-1:2000 standard (based in part on Unicode), which can
be used to represent the characters of virtually all
standardized character sets. The standard developers
initially agreed upon using UCS2 (16-bit Unicode) as the
internal representation. This repertoire of characters
provides a sufficiently rich set to represent all
commonly-used codesets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
standard developers found that the 16-bit Unicode
representation had some problems. It forced the issue of
standardizing byte ordering. The 2-byte length of each
character made the extended header records twice as long for
the case of strings coded entirely from historical 7-bit
ASCII. For these reasons, the standard developers chose the
UTF-8 defined in the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard. This
multi-byte representation encodes UCS2 or UCS4 characters
reliably and deterministically, eliminating the need for a
canonical byte ordering. In addition, NUL octets and other
characters possibly confusing to POSIX file systems do not
appear, except to represent themselves. It was realized that
certain national codesets take up more space after the
encoding, due to their placement within the UCS range; it
was felt that the usefulness of the encoding of the names
outweighs the disadvantage of size increase for file, user,
and group names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The encoding of
UTF-8 is as follows:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-10369.png" alt="Image grohtml-10369.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where each
&rsquo;<i>x</i>&rsquo; represents a bit value from the
character being translated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ustar
Interchange Format</b> <br>
The description of the <b>ustar</b> format reflects numerous
enhancements over pre-1988 versions of the historical
<b>tar</b> utility. The goal of these changes was not only
to provide the functional enhancements desired, but also to
retain compatibility between new and old versions. This
compatibility has been retained. Archives written using the
old archive format are compatible with the new format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementors
should be aware that the previous file format did not
include a mechanism to archive directory type files. For
this reason, the convention of using a filename ending with
slash was adopted to specify a directory on the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The total size
of the <i>name</i> and <i>prefix</i> fields have been set to
meet the minimum requirements for <i>{PATH_MAX}</i> If a
pathname will fit within the <i>name</i> field, it is
recommended that the pathname be stored there without the
use of the <i>prefix</i> field. Although the name field is
known to be too small to contain <i>{PATH_MAX}</i>
characters, the value was not changed in this version of the
archive file format to retain backwards-compatibility, and
instead the <i>prefix</i> was introduced. Also, because of
the earlier version of the format, there is no way to remove
the restriction on the <i>linkname</i> field being limited
in size to just that of the <i>name</i> field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>size</i>
field is required to be meaningful in all implementation
extensions, although it could be zero. This is required so
that the data blocks can always be properly counted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is suggested
that if device special files need to be represented that
cannot be represented in the standard format, that one of
the extension types (<b>A</b>&minus;<b>Z</b>) be used, and
that the additional information for the special file be
represented as data and be reflected in the <i>size</i>
field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attempting to
restore a special file type, where it is converted to
ordinary data and conflicts with an existing filename, need
not be specially detected by the utility. If run as an
ordinary user, <b>pax</b> should not be able to overwrite
the entries in, for example, <b>/dev</b> in any case
(whether the file is converted to another type or not). If
run as a privileged user, it should be able to do so, and it
would be considered a bug if it did not. The same is true of
ordinary data files and similarly named special files; it is
impossible to anticipate the needs of the user (who could
really intend to overwrite the file), so the behavior should
be predictable (and thus regular) and rely on the protection
system as required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value
<b>7</b> in the <i>typeflag</i> field is intended to define
how contiguous files can be stored in a <b>ustar</b>
archive. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not require the
contiguous file extension, but does define a standard way of
archiving such files so that all conforming systems can
interpret these file types in a meaningful and consistent
manner. On a system that does not support extended file
types, the <b>pax</b> utility should do the best it can with
the file and go on to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
protection modes are those conventionally used by the
<b>ls</b>(1) utility. This is extended beyond the usage in
the ISO POSIX-2 standard to support the &quot;shared
text&quot; or &quot;sticky&quot; bit. It is intended that
the conformance document should not document anything beyond
the existence of and support of such a mode. Further
extensions are expected to these bits, particularly with
overloading the set-user-ID and set-group-ID flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cpio
Interchange Format</b> <br>
The reference to appropriate privilege in the <b>cpio</b>
format refers to an error on standard output; the
<b>ustar</b> format does not make comparable statements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The model for
this format was the historical System V <b>cpio &minus;c</b>
data interchange format. This model documents the portable
version of the <b>cpio</b> format and not the binary
version. It has the flexibility to transfer data of any type
described within IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, yet is extensible to
transfer data types specific to extensions beyond IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 (for example, contiguous files). Because it
describes existing practice, there is no question of
maintaining upwards-compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cpio
Header</b> <br>
There has been some concern that the size of the
<i>c_ino</i> field of the header is too small to handle
those systems that have very large inode numbers. However,
the <i>c_ino</i> field in the header is used strictly as a
hard-link resolution mechanism for archives. It is not
necessarily the same value as the inode number of the file
in the location from which that file is extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name
<i>c_magic</i> is based on historical usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cpio
Filename</b> <br>
For most historical implementations of the <b>cpio</b>
utility, <i>{PATH_MAX}</i> octets can be used to describe
the pathname without the addition of any other header fields
(the NUL character would be included in this count).
<i>{PATH_MAX}</i> is the minimum value for pathname size,
documented as 256 bytes. However, an implementation may use
<i>c_namesize</i> to determine the exact length of the
pathname. With the current description of the
<b>&lt;cpio.h&gt;</b> header, this pathname size can be as
large as a number that is described in six octal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two values are
documented under the <i>c_mode</i> field values to provide
for extensibility for known file types: <b><br>
0110 000</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reserved for contiguous files.
The implementation may treat the rest of the information for
this archive like a regular file. If this file type is
undefined, the implementation may create the file as a
regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This provides
for extensibility of the <b>cpio</b> format while allowing
for the ability to read old archives. Files of an unknown
type may be read as &quot;regular files&quot; on some
implementations. On a system that does not support extended
file types, the <b>pax</b> utility should do the best it can
with the file and go on to the next.</p>

1003.1-2001/Cor 1-2002, item XCU/TC1/D6/35 is applied,
adding the process ID of the <b>pax</b> process into certain
fields. This change provides a method for the implementation
to ensure that different instances of <b>pax</b> extracting
a file named <b>/a/b/foo</b> will not collide when
processing the extended header information associated with

error and that the last option specified will determine the

removing the <i>ctime</i> paragraph within the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION. There is a contradiction in the definition of
the <i>ctime</i> keyword for the <b>pax</b> extended header,
in that the <i>st_ctime</i> member of the <b>stat</b>
structure does not refer to a file creation time. No field
in the standard stat structure from
<b>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</b> includes a file creation time.</p>
