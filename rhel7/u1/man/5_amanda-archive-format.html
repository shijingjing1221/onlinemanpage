&minus; Format of amanda archive streams</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Amanda
archive format is designed to be a simple, efficient means
of interleaving multiple simultaneous files, allowing an
arbitrary number of data streams for a file. It is a
streaming format in the sense that the writer need not know
the size of files until they are completely written to the
archive, and the reader can process the archive in constant
space.</p>

<h2>DATA MODEL
<a name="DATA MODEL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The data stored
in an archive consists of an unlimited number of files. Each
file consists of a number of &quot;attributes&quot;, each
identified by a 16&minus;bit ID. Each attribute can contain
an unlimited amount of data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attribute IDs
less than 16 (AMAR_ATTR_APP_START) are reserved for special
purposes, but the remaining IDs are available for
application&minus;specific uses.</p>

<h2>STRUCTURE
<a name="STRUCTURE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>RECORDS</b>
<br>
A record can be either a header record or a data record. A
header record serves as a &quot;checkpoint&quot; in the
file, with a magic value that can be used to recognize
archive files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A header record
has a fixed size of 28 bytes, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">28 bytes: magic
string <br>
The magic string is the ASCII text &quot;AMANDA ARCHIVE
FORMAT &quot; followed by a decimal representation of the
format version number (currently '1'), padded to 28 bytes
with NUL bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A data record
has a variable size, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2 bytes: file
number <br>
2 bytes: attribute ID <br>
4 bytes: data size (N) <br>
N bytes: data <br>
The file number and attribute ID serve to identify the data
stream to which this data belongs. The low 31 bits of the
data size give the number of data bytes following, while the
high bit (the EOA bit) indicates the end of the attribute,
as described below. Because records are generally read into
memory in their entirety, the data size must not exceed 4MB
(4194304 bytes). All integers are in network byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A header record
is distinguished from a data record by the magic string. The
file number 0x414d, corresponding to the characters
&quot;AM&quot;, is forbidden and must be skipped on
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attribute ID 0
(AMAR_ATTR_FILENAME) gives the filename of a file. This
attribute is mandatory for each file, must be nonempty, must
fit in a single record, and must precede any other
attributes for the same file in the archive. The filename
should be a printable string (ASCII or UTF&minus;8), to
facilitate use of generic archive&minus;display utilities,
but the format permits any nonempty bytestring. The filename
cannot span multiple records.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attribute ID 1
(AMAR_ATTR_EOF) signals the end of a file. This attribute
must contain no data, but should have the EOA bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CONNECTION
TO DATA MODEL</b> <br>
Each file in an archive is assigned a file number distinct
from any other active file in the archive. The first record
for a file must have attribute ID 0 (AMAR_ATTR_FILENAME),
indicating a filename. A file ends with an empty record with
ID 1 (AMAR_ATTR_EOF). For every file at which a reader might
want to begin reading, the filename record should be
preceded by a header record. How often to write header
records is left to the discretion of the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All data
records with the same file number and attribute ID are
considered a part of the same attribute. The boundaries
between such records are not significant to the contents of
the attribute, and both readers and writers are free to
alter such boundaries as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final data
record for each attribute has the high bit (the EOA bit) of
its data size field set. A writer must not reuse an
attribute ID within a file. An attribute may be terminated
by a record containing both data and an EOA bit, or by a
zero&minus;length record with its EOA bit set.</p>
