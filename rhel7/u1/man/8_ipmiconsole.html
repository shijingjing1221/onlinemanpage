&minus; IPMI console utility</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ipmiconsole</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ipmiconsole</b>
is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility. It can be used
to establish console sessions to remote machines using the
IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol. <b>Ipmiconsole</b> communicates with
a remote machine&rsquo;s Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) to establish a console session. Before any SOL
communication can take place, the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC
must be configured properly. The FreeIPMI tool
<b>bmc-config(8)</b> may be used to do this
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Often (although
not always), console redirection must be also be configured
properly in the BIOS and/or operating system. Both must be
configured to redirect console traffic out the appropriate
COM port. Please see your motherboard and OS documentation
for instructions on proper setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listed below
are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble
shooting information, workaround information, examples, and
known issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please
see <b>freeipmi(7).</b></p>

<h2>GENERAL OPTIONS
<a name="GENERAL OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are general options for configuring IPMI
communication and executing general tool commands. <b><br>
&minus;h</b> <i>IPMIHOST,</i>
<b>&minus;&minus;hostname</b>=<i>IPMIHOST[:PORT]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the remote host to
communicate with. An optional port can be specified, which
may be useful in port forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;username</b>=<i>USERNAME</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the username to use
when authenticating with the remote host. If not specified,
a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must a
high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b>
<i>PASSWORD</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;password</b>=<i>PASSWORD</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the password to use
when authenticationg with the remote host. If not specified,
a null password is assumed. Maximum password length is 16
for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;P</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;password-prompt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prompt for password to avoid
possibility of listing it in process lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;k</b> <i>K_G</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;k-g</b>=<i>K_G</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the K_g BMC key to use
when authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If
not specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in
hexadecimal form, prefix the string with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;.
E.g., the key &rsquo;abc&rsquo; can be entered with the
either the string &rsquo;abc&rsquo; or the string
&rsquo;0x616263&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;K</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;k-g-prompt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prompt for k-g to avoid
possibility of listing it in process lists.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;session-timeout</b>=<i>MILLISECONDS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the session timeout in
milliseconds. Defaults to 60000 milliseconds (60 seconds) if
not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;retransmission-timeout</b>=<i>MILLISECONDS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the packet
retransmission timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 500
milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;cipher&minus;suite-id</b>=<i>CIPHER-SUITE-ID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher
suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID identifies a set of
authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithms to
use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authentication algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for
session packet signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for payload encryption.
Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not specified. The user
should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8, and 12
encrypt console payloads. Console information will be sent
in the clear if an alternate cipher suite id is selected.
The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">0 -

<i>PRIVILEGE&minus;LEVEL</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;privilege-level</b>=<i>PRIVILEGE&minus;LEVEL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the privilege level to
be used. The currently available privilege levels are USER,
OPERATOR, and ADMIN. Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;config&minus;file</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate
configuration file.</p>

<b>&minus;&minus;workaround&minus;flags</b>=<i>WORKAROUNDS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify workarounds to vendor
compliance issues. Multiple workarounds can be specified
separated by commas. A special command line flag of
&quot;none&quot;, will indicate no workarounds (may be
useful for overriding configured defaults). See WORKAROUNDS
below for a list of available workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;debug</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turn on debugging.</p>

<h2>IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS
<a name="IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are specific to <b>Ipmiconsole. <br>
&minus;e</b> <i>CHAR</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;escape-char</b>=<i>CHAR</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an alternate escape
character (default char &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dont-steal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not steal an SOL session if
one is already detected as being in use. Under most
circumstances, if SOL is detected as being in use,
<b>ipmiconsole</b> will attempt to steal the SOL session
away from the previous session. This default behavior exists
for several reasons, most notably that earlier SOL sessions
may have not been able to be deactivate properly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;deactivate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Deactivate SOL session if one
is detected as being in use and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;serial&minus;keepalive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Occasionally send NUL
characters to detect inactive serial connections. This
option is particularly useful for those who intend to run
<b>ipmiconsole</b> without much interaction, such as for
logging purposes. While IPMI connections may still be alive,
some motherboards have exhibited bugs in which underlying
serial data can no longer be sent/received. From the
viewpoint of <b>ipmiconsole,</b> data is simply not be sent
out of the remote system and this problem is only detected
once there is user interaction. By sending the occasional
NUL character, the underlying loss of serial data transfer
can be detected far more quickly. There is some risk with
this option, as the NUL character byte may affect the remote
system depending on what data it may or may not be
expecting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;serial&minus;keepalive&minus;empty</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is identical to
<b>&minus;&minus;serial&minus;keepalive</b> except that SOL
packets will contain no NUL character data. On some
motherboards, this may be sufficient to deal with a hanging
IPMI session without the risk regularly sending a NUL
character byte may have. However, some systems may not ACK a
SOL packet without character data in it, meaning these
keepalive packets do nothing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sol&minus;payload&minus;instance</b>=<i>NUM</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the SOL payload
instance number. The default value is 1, valid values range
from 1 to 15. Most systems only support a single instance,
however a few allow users to access multiple.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;deactivate&minus;all&minus;instances</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When used along with the
<b>&minus;&minus;deactivate</b> option, will deactivate all
active SOL instances instead of just the currently
configured payload instance.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;lock-memory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lock sensitive information
(such as usernames and passwords) in memory.</p>

<h2>ESCAPE CHARACTERS
<a name="ESCAPE CHARACTERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
escape sequences are supported. The default supported escape
character is &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, but can be changed with
the <b>&minus;e</b> option.</p>

<h2>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most often,
IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IPMI over LAN
problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote
machine&rsquo;s BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machine&rsquo;s BMC:
IP address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privilege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
<b>bmc-config(8)</b> tool can be used to check and/or change
these configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS below
to also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listed below
are many of the common issues for error messages. For
additional support, please e-mail the
&lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;username
invalid&quot; - The username entered (or a NULL username if
none was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It
may also be possible the remote BMC&rsquo;s username
configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;password
invalid&quot; - The password entered (or a NULL password if
none was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible
the password for the user is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;password
verification timeout&quot; - Password verification has timed
out. A &quot;password invalid&quot; error (described above)
or a generic &quot;session timeout&quot; (described below)
occurred. During this point in the protocol it cannot be
differentiated which occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;k_g
invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if
none was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible
the K_g key is not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try
to authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require
authenticating to a different user which has a higher
maximum privilege.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;privilege
level cannot be obtained for this user&quot; - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than
the maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a
lower privilege. It may also be possible the maximum
privilege level allowed for a user is not configured
properly on the remote BMC.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;authentication
type unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot; - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not
available for this privilege level. Please try again with an
alternate authentication type or alternate privilege level.
It may also be possible the available authentication types
you can authenticate with are not correctly configured on
the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;cipher
suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please
try again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be
possible the available cipher suite ids are not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ipmi 2.0
unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the
remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;connection
timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number
of potential errors are possible, including an invalid
hostname specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved,
IPMI is not enabled on the remote server, the network
connection is bad, etc. Please verify configuration and
connectivity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;session
timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed out. Please
reconnect. If this error occurs often, you may wish to
increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are
considerably slower than others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;internal
IPMI error&quot; - An IPMI error has occurred that FreeIPMI
does not know how to handle. Please e-mail
&lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; to report the
issue.</p>

<h2>IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
are common issues for error messages in
<b>ipmiconsole.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL
unavailable&quot; - SOL is not configured for use on the
remote BMC. It may be not configured in general or for the
specific user specified. Authenticating with a different
user may be sufficient, however the IPMI protocol does not
reveal detail on what is not configured on the remote
BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL in
use&quot; - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC. If you
do not specify the <i>--dont-steal</i> option,
<b>ipmiconsole</b> will attempt to steal the SOL session
away from the other session. Not all BMCs support the
ability to steal away a SOL session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL
session stolen&quot; - Your SOL session has been stolen by
another session. You may wish to try and steal the session
back by reconnecting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL
requires encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite id
that includes encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id
3, 8, or 12. It may also be possible the encryption
requirements are not configured correctly on the remote
BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SOL
requires no encryption&quot; - SOL requires a cipher suite
id that does not use encryption. Please try to use cipher
suite id 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, or 11. It may also be possible the
encryption requirements are not configured correctly on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC
Implementation&quot; - The BMC on the remote machine has a
severe problem in its implementation. Please see the
WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds. If
additional vendor workarounds are required, please contact
the authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;excess
retransmissions sent&quot; - An excessive number of
retransmissions of SOL packets has occurred and
<b>ipmiconsole</b> has given up. This may be due to network
issues or SOL issues. Some of the same issues involved with
&quot;connection timeout&quot; or &quot;session
timeout&quot; errors may be involved. Please try to
reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;excess
errors received&quot; - An excessive number of SOL packet
errors has occurred and <b>ipmiconsole</b> has given up.
This may be due to network issues or SOL issues. Please try
to reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BMC
Error&quot; - This error usually means a vendor SOL
implementation requires a combination of authentication,
encryption, privilege, etc. that have not been met by the
user&rsquo;s choices. Please try a combination of different
cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve the problem.
Please see the WORKAROUNDS section below for possible
workarounds too.</p>

<h2>WORKAROUNDS
<a name="WORKAROUNDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With so many
different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,
different vendors may implement their IPMI protocols
incorrectly. The following describes a number of workarounds
currently available to handle discovered compliance issues.
When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they
will be transparent to the user. However, some will require
the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hardware
listed below may only indicate the hardware that a problem
was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may
or may not exhibit the same problems. Different vendors may
license their firmware from the same IPMI firmware
developer, so it may be worthwhile to try workarounds listed
below even if your motherboard is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
your hardware has an additional compliance issue that needs
a workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI
maintainers on &lt;freeipmi&minus;users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi&minus;devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>authcap</i>
- This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support
and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around
multiple issues in which the remote system does not properly
report username capabilities, authentication capabilities,
or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>nochecksumcheck</i>
- This workaround flag will tell FreeIPMI to not check the
checksums returned from IPMI command responses. It works
around systems that return invalid checksums due to
implementation errors, but the packet is otherwise valid.
Users are cautioned on the use of this option, as it removes
validation of packet integrity in a number of circumstances.
However, it is unlikely to be an issue in most situations.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;connection
timeout&quot;, &quot;session timeout&quot;, or
&quot;password verification timeout&quot; errors. On IPMI
1.5 connections, the &quot;noauthcodecheck&quot; workaround
may also needed too. Issue observed on Supermicro X9SCM-iiF,
Supermicro X9DRi-F, and Supermicro X9DRFR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>intel20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;password
invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management
Module (Professional Edition).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>supermicro20</i>
- This workaround flag will work around several Supermicro
IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon
IPMI firmware. The issues covered include handling invalid
length authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed
on newerver firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sun20</i> -
This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include
invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and
invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround automatically includes the
&quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>opensesspriv</i>
- This workaround flag will slightly alter FreeIPMI&rsquo;s
IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid
hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege
level sent during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0
connection is used for hashing keys instead of the privilege
level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g
invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad rmcpplus status code&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM,
Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro
X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, Intel
S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN.
This workaround is automatically triggered with the
&quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>integritycheckvalue</i>
- This workaround flag will work around an invalid integrity
check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment when
using Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be
0 length, however the remote motherboard responds with a
non-empty field. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;k_g
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8DTG,
Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and
Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>solpayloadsize</i>
- This workaround flag will not check for valid SOL payload
sizes and assume a proper set. It works around remote
systems that report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC
Implementation&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu II, Sun x4100, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG,
Supermicro X8DTU, and Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>solport</i>
- This workaround flag will ignore alternate SOL ports
specified during the protocol. It works around remote
systems that report invalid alternate SOL ports. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;connection timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and Supermicro
X8DTH-iF.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>solstatus</i>
- This workaround flag will not check the current activation
status of SOL during the protocol setup. It works around
remote systems that do not properly support this command.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC Error&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Supermicro X8SIL-F.</p>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES
<a name="KNOWN ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
operating systems, if you input your username, password, and
other potentially security relevant information on the
command line, this information may be discovered by other
users when using tools like the <b>ps(1)</b> command or
looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the
-P or -K options. Configuring security relevant information
in the FreeIPMI configuration file would also be an
appropriate way to hide this information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
&quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote authentication
errors. You may need to wait awhile in order to this
temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
authenticate again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
motherboards define an OEM SOL inactivity timeout for SOL
sessions. If SOL sessions stay inactive for long periods of
time, <b>ipmiconsole</b> sessions may be abruptly closed,
most likely resulting in session timeout errors. Please see
OEM notes for information on modifying this parameter if you
wish for sessions to stay active longer.</p>

<h2>SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES
<a name="SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Intel
SR1520ML/X38ML: After a reboot, the SOL session appears to
&quot;disconnect&quot; from the motherboard but stay alive.
Character data input from the <b>ipmiconsole</b> client is
accepted by the remote machine, but no character data or
console data is ever sent back from the remote machine. The
SOL session is subsequently useless. There is currently no
workaround in place to handle this. The session must be
closed and restarted.</p>
